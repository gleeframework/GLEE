"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's a ""good deal"" for her, it's still above your budget. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best course of action at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings and it's still well below what I could get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While she's come down, you're still looking to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer is the best strategy at this point.  You can potentially close a deal closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $900,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's getting closer to your budget. You've already made several counter-offers, and further negotiations might not yield a significantly better price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product while staying within a reasonable price range."
