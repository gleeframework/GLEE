"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $105? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $105. How about $95? That's still a good price for me, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $100 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $92? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",92.0,Bob,6,
