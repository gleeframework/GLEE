Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($50) between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy:

* **Maximizes Profit (Potential):** If Bob accepts, you make a $40 profit.
* **Provides a Buffer:** You're still above your minimum even if Bob negotiates slightly downwards. 
* **Maintains Attractiveness:** The price is still appealing to Bob compared to his $150 valuation."
