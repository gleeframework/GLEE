Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued and incentivize him to accept the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $9,500, I leave myself room to negotiate down if necessary. I can still make a good profit even if I drop the price a bit. 
* **Plan B:** Remember, I have John as a backup option, so I don't need to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still have a chance to get a better price. I can make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle.
* **John is a secure backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my counteroffer is still reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using a tone that suggests I'm open to further negotiation if necessary.

This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to meet me halfway while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is only $750 below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for More Negotiations:** While I'd prefer a higher price,  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for the same price. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer means I can close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation rounds.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most pragmatic decision.  It secures a sale that is close to my minimum and avoids the potential delays of further negotiation."
