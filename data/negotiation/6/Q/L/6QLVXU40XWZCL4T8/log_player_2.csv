# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, it's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice. There's no guarantee, but rejecting the first offer opens the possibility of negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $120?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant offer below Alice's asking price.  A $30 reduction shows your willingness to negotiate seriously while still demonstrating interest. The message is friendly and open to finding a middle ground, encouraging a positive interaction."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I can go down to $135.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $135 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.  How about $125?  Let's split the difference and come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show your commitment to negotiation while moving closer to Alice's price.  Proposing a middle ground suggests a willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both parties.  The message remains friendly and positive to maintain a good rapport."
