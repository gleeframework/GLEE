"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $120?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I can go down to $135.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $135 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.  How about $125?  Let's split the difference and come to an agreement.",125.0,Bob,4,
