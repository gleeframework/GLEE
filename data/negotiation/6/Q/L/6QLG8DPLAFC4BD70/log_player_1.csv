Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Create Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Why this is better than offering $120 directly:**

* Offering the product at Bob's maximum perceived value or higher ($100 or more) is unlikely to result in a sale.
* While I have a guaranteed sale with John at $120, there's a chance to earn a bit more from Bob if I offer a price he finds appealing."
