"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000. It's a fair price that considers the value I see in it."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer allows room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  I'm aiming to be within my budget while still offering a price Alice might consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? This would give you a good price and ensure we both come away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to my range, $9,500 is still a significant difference from my initial offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $8,000.  I'm aware that going to John is an option if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $8,250? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between our last two offers, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also standing firm on my budget limitations. This price point leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $9,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a bit further since getting the product below $9,000 would be a significant saving compared to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,500.  That reflects a serious commitment on my end, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm strategically increasing my offer to show Alice I'm flexible and want to reach an agreement. Offering $8,500 keeps me competitive while still aiming for a price below her $9,000 offer. It's a balance between pushing for a good deal and showing I'm willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750? I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly demonstrating her willingness to negotiate by meeting me in the middle.  $8,750 is a solid price, saving me $1,250 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate for a potentially insignificant gain isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
