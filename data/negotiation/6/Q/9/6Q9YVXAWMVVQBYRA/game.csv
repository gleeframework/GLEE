"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Can we meet in the middle again?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Let's try to find a sweet spot. My next offer is $13,000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. Can we meet in the middle again?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum. My next offer is $12,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're interested, this is your last chance to make a deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet your minimum, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",11000.0,Bob,8,
