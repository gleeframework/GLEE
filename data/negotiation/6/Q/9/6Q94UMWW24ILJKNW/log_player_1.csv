Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum threshold. It leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still below my minimum threshold of $120, it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. It's a better deal than selling to John for $120, and there's no guarantee that I can secure a higher price in future negotiations.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $90."
