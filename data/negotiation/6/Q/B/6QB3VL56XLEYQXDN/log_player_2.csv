# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore other options or potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
