You're still above your target price of $85.  Let's see if you can get it lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $92. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll sell it to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

While you'd ideally want to get it down to $90, Alice is holding firm at $92, and you're within your budget of $120. It's a reasonable price and worth accepting."
