"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit too high for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference at $132.50? That way we can both get a good deal.",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $132.50 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we try $137.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, let's try to be realistic here. $137.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up a bit to $134.  Let's close this deal, I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",134.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to get this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $136, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",136.0,Alice,7,
