"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
