"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me at that price?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is a more comfortable price for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we discuss $1750000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1750000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to go up to $1600000. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1700000?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000. Can you consider that?",1650000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get at least $1725000. How about we meet at that price?",1725000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated, to be honest. I'm willing to meet you at $1700000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable going above that price. Can you accept that?",1700000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $1700000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1750000 or I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer.",1750000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making your final offer, but I'm not willing to go above $1700000. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",1700000.0,Bob,10,
