"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

This is a starting point in the negotiation. By offering significantly less, I am aiming to understand Alice's lower bound and leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While the product is good, $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  Alice came down $100,000, so I'm trying to show willingness to negotiate by going up $150,000 from my previous offer. 
* **Staying above John's price:** I'm still aiming for a price significantly lower than my fallback option of buying from John at $1,000,000. 
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:**  This counteroffer will give me more information about how low Alice might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer by stating  ""This is as low as I'm willing to go.""  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm or walk away. Accepting at $1,050,000 secures me the product at a price still $50,000 cheaper than John's offer."
