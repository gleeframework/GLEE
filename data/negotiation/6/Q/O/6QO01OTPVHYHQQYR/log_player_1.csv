Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$120 is way below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still above my minimum price, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable price and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to accept his offer, as it's the best I can get at this point.  Although I could sell to John for the same price, I'm  avoiding any further negotiation and securing the sale."
