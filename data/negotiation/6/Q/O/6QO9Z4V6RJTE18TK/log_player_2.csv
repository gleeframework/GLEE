"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1500000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price or explore other options.  It's too early to buy from John yet as you haven't seen if you can get a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1400000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. It's also possible that Alice might be willing to come down further if you reject her offer again."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can continue to negotiate with Alice.  It's possible she might be willing to lower her price further, especially since you have a clear maximum budget. You're still not ready to buy from John because you haven't exhausted all options with Alice yet."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1150000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1180000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,180,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You've negotiated with Alice for a while, and while it seems she's willing to come down, it's unclear if you can get her to your price point.  At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase from John for $1,000,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
