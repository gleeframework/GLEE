Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The range where a deal can happen is between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return you'll see on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" and the ""significant return"" helps justify the price, even if those benefits aren't explicitly quantified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies you're open to discussion, but you've set a strong anchor at $1,100,000.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,050,000) to give yourself more wiggle room.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're on a tight deadline, you might be more willing to accept a lower offer from Bob to avoid the risk of him walking away. 

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response."
