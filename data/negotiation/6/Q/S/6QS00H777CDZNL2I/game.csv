I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1200000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to you and allows me to make the purchase within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1100000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950000, which is closer to my initial offer and still allows you to make a substantial profit.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $950000. This price allows you to make a significant profit while remaining within my budget. It's a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1025000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
