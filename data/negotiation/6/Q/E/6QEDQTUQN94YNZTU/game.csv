"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $175 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is really too low. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $80? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",80.0,Bob,6,
