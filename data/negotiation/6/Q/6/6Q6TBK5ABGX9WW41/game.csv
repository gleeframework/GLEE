"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $120. This is my top offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can do $155, which is my lowest price. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
