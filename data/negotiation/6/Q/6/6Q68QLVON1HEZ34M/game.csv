"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
