# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice, as it's possible she might be willing to go lower than $1,000,000 to close the deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price."
