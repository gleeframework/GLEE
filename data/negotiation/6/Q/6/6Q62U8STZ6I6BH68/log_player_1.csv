"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value but allows room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is below my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's a step closer to his desired price and hopefully signals my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell at that price.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $85. This is a significant concession, but I want to see if we can close the deal.  If Bob rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is offering my minimum value.  I'm not sure if he'll go higher, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  John is guaranteed to buy it for the same price, so I'll go with the sure thing."
