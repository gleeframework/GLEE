"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent price, it's still above your ideal price range. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum value. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to save a considerable amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to your desired price range, it's still a bit above your target. There's still room to negotiate, and it's likely Alice is willing to come down further. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your initial offer, but still below Alice's current offer. It shows you're willing to meet halfway and demonstrates your commitment to finding a solution. This could potentially lead to a quick agreement and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
