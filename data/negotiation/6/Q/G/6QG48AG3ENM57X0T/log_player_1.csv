"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  My initial offer is not my absolute limit, leaving space for counteroffers without risking selling to John right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my needs? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John is an option:**  While $1,000,000 from John is a guaranteed sale, I still have 8 rounds to potentially get a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a price closer to $1,000,000, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, reflecting the value I know you see in this product.  This price allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** I'm offering my minimum acceptable price, showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Mutual benefit:** I frame the deal as beneficial for both parties, encouraging cooperation. 
* **No room for further reduction:** This offer is my bottom line, putting pressure on Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Rejecting gives me another round to push for a higher price.
* **John's offer:**  I'm not desperate yet, as John's $1,000,000 offer is still available. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but aiming for a final deal closer to $975,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your flexibility.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your needs. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by dropping the price slightly, but not significantly, from my previous offer. 
* **Focus on value and needs:** I'm reiterating the product's value and acknowledging Bob's budgetary constraints.
* **Urgency and finality:** I'm suggesting it's time to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and implying this is my final offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but close enough to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've done some further research and am confident in my ability to secure the product elsewhere. However, I would still like to make a final counteroffer of $960,000. I hope this brings us closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time is ticking:** We're down to 4 rounds remaining.  
* **Risk of losing out:** Bob's mention of securing the product elsewhere suggests he might be serious about walking away.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is still on the table, it's a guaranteed $1,000,000, while I have a chance to potentially get a slightly higher price with Bob. However, the risk of losing the deal with Bob is too high, and the potential gain is too low, making accepting Bob's offer the best decision."
