"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him to budge.  If he refuses again, I'll go ahead and sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? This is the best I can do. If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $8,750? I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob has made it clear that he's not going to budge on his offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to my target price, selling to John for $10,000 is still a good outcome. It's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
