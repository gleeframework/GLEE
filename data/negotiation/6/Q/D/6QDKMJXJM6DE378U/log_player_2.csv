"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. There's a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum price, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer provides a substantial discount from Alice's offer, making it attractive to Alice while still leaving some room for further negotiation. It also demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously, showing that he's a motivated buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his desired maximum price. There's still room for negotiation to try and get a price closer to $1,000,000.  Bob can continue to counter-offer, potentially leading to a more favorable deal.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but Bob should see if he can get a better price from Alice before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another counteroffer, pushing closer to his desired price while still leaving some room for negotiation.  This offer shows he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible deal."
