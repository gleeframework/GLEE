"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount to the right buyer.  I'm confident that its value will exceed $1200000.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a price that reflects the product's potential, while still leaving room for you to realize a substantial return on your investment.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
