"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in buying, but I'd need to see a price closer to $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is significantly lower than what I can agree to.  How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you get at that price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price that respects both our needs. Let's close this deal!",130.0,Bob,4,
