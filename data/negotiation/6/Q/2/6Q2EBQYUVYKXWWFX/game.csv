Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a great price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think!,200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product but would be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $175? That's still a great price considering the product's value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $150 for the product. It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
