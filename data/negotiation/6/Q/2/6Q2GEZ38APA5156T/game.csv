"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $650,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,5,
