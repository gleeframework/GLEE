"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $107 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $111. How does that sound?",111.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've got a great product there, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle on $109?  That's a fair compromise.",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $109 is still a little too low. How about we compromise at $110? That's just a dollar more than your last offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Alice,7,
