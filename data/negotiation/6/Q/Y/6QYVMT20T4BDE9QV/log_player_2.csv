"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price ($120).** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.** 
* **Buying from John is still an option, but you want to exhaust the negotiation with Alice first.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
