"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still above your desired price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to your desired price point, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You should continue to negotiate, as you still have time to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still stuck at $8,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm still willing to make one last concession, but I need at least $8,800. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your target. You still have time to negotiate, and it's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8,600. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best option for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,600 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,700, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, you're getting closer to your budget limit.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and you only have a few rounds left. To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal, it's best to take John's offer and secure the product at your desired price."
