``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and the price difference is getting smaller. While there's a chance to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's becoming riskier. Accepting the $870,000 offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice raising the price or the deal falling through altogether."
