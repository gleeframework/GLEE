"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to keep negotiating to try and get a better price.  While $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale, I still have 9 rounds to potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still aiming for a good profit. I believe that $1,200,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's low offer and the fact that I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still significantly below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I also have to weigh the risk of running out of rounds and having to settle for the $1,000,000 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as it's the same as John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my target price, and I only have 4 rounds left. While $1,000,000 from John is a guaranteed sale, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get him to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm making one last concession to try and close the deal with Bob. I'm dropping my price to $900,000, which is still a good profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll have to accept John's offer in the next round."
