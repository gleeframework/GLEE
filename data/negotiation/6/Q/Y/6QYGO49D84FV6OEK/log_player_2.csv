"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $800,000 from her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $700,000 is a significant discount from her asking price, but still leaves some room for us to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal.  I'll counter-offer and see if Alice is willing to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice my maximum price. At this point, I'm willing to pay John's price to get the product, so I don't have much room to negotiate further.  If Alice rejects this, I'll just buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is only $20,000 less than John's price. At this point, there isn't much room to negotiate further and the risk of further rounds doesn't seem worth the potential savings. It's better to buy from John and secure the product for $800,000."
