"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from $10,000. However, I'm looking to spend a little less. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value than his own. This creates room for further negotiation.
* **Middle Ground:** The offer of $8,500 is halfway between Alice's value of $8,000 and Bob's maximum of $10,000. This signals a willingness to compromise but also sets a strong starting point.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message acknowledges Alice's initial offer, showing respect, while still expressing Bob's desire for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,750. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice has made a significant compromise by moving down to $8,750. This price is closer to Bob's goal of saving money.
* **Value to Alice:** Alice has clearly stated that this is her best offer, considering the product's value to her is $8,000.  Further negotiation might not yield much more savings.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Rejecting this offer risks ending up paying $10,000 to John, which is more than the current price.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer is the most rational decision given the information available."
