"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to make you a deal. My price is $1,200,000. This gives you a significant profit margin while still allowing me to secure a fair price. Please consider this offer carefully.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
