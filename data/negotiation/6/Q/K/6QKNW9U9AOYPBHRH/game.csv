"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is a fair reflection of this product's value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still too high.  I'm firm on $12,000.  This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I want to be fair and understand you're at your limit. How about we split the difference one last time at $12,750. This is my final offer.",12750.0,Alice,5,
