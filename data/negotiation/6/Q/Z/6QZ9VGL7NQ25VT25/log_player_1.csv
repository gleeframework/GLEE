Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves you some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **Appeal to Bob:**  The message frames the offer as a deal specifically for him, potentially making him more inclined to accept.

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
