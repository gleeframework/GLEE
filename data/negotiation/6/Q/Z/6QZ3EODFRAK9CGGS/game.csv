"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer of $1,400,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering.  While $1,300,000 is certainly a strong offer, I'm still confident the product's value is closer to my initial proposal.  Would you consider $1,375,000?  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,375,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to propose $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me. What are your thoughts?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
