Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

You're still looking to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still more than your ideal price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's likely Alice is not going to budge much further. You've already managed to get the price down to $105, which is a good deal considering your maximum budget is $150.  Accepting her offer saves you $45 compared to buying from John."
