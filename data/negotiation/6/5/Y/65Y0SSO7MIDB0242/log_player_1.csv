Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's our guaranteed profit from John.
* **Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it slightly below John's price ($119) gives Bob a perceived deal while still maximizing our potential profit.

**Why this approach is better than other options:**

* **Offering at $120 or higher:** Bob would definitely reject this, as it's more than he values the product.
* **Offering much lower (e.g., $100-110):** This leaves potential profit on the table. While Bob is more likely to accept, we could've gotten more. 

This strategy aims for the best balance between a likely acceptance from Bob and a profitable outcome for us."
