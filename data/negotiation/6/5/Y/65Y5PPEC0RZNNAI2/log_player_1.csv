{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone, hoping to entice Bob to make a counteroffer.  

I'll be watching Bob's response closely, and ready to adjust my strategy based on his actions!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's important to stand my ground and see if I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, considering your interest. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I also have a firm bottom line.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject this offer and counter once more, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. How about $87?  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm offering a final counteroffer at $87, which is closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short of my target. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, it's clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum."
