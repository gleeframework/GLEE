Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer gives me a significant profit while still being attractive to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to him, he has some room to negotiate but it's still a good deal for him. This allows room for potential counteroffers, and I can adjust my position based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my preferred price. Accepting his offer gets me $1,000 more than selling to John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
