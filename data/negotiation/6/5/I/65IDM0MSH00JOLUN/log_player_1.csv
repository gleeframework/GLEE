{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum desired value ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to counteroffer without me immediately feeling the need to go to John. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response. If he counters, I'll evaluate his offer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:** I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to potentially earn more by counteroffering.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  Knowing that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value our potential partnership,  $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This would allow me to make the deal work and still give you a good price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,200,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing the Benefit to Both Parties:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob while also highlighting the necessity for a price that allows me to make a reasonable profit.
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:**  While $1,350,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still leaving a small buffer for further negotiation if Bob isn't willing to go that high.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he's still not willing to meet my price, I'll need to decide whether to accept his offer, counteroffer again, or go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? This is the highest I can go, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Close to John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is within a reasonable distance from Bob's current offer. I can afford to risk another round of negotiation.
* **The Pressure is On:**  Bob has indicated that this is his highest offer, which adds a sense of urgency. However, I am confident in my ability to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $1,500,000. My aim is to nudge him closer to a compromise that works for both of us. If he doesn't budge, I can always go to John for a guaranteed sale."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this purchase.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still just a bit short of what I need to make this work. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This would be a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($1,350,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,250,000). This demonstrates continued flexibility and a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting the Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both parties, as it's close to Bob's maximum and closer to my desired price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts my offer, counteroffers again, or walks away.
* **Prepared for a Final Decision:**  If Bob doesn't budge, I will either accept his last offer or go with John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
