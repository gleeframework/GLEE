"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value our potential partnership,  $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This would allow me to make the deal work and still give you a good price.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? This is the highest I can go, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this purchase.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still just a bit short of what I need to make this work. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This would be a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!",1400000.0,Alice,5,
