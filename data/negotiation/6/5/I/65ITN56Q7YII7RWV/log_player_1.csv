Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you at a price of $1,300,000. I think its value will far exceed this price for you in the long run."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** We want to start high to give ourselves room to negotiate down if needed. Bob might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if we present a convincing case.
* **Below John's offer:** The offer is still significantly below John's offer ($1,500,000), ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates down somewhat. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message hints at the value exceeding the price, subtly leaving space for negotiation without directly stating it.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale. We want to aim high with Bob, knowing we have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
