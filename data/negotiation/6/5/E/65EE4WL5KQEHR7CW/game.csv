"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be more affordable. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
