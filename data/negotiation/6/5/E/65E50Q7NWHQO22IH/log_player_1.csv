{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary. I'm also being positive and encouraging, hoping to get Bob excited about the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd rather sell to Bob than John, I need to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to make another counteroffer to try and get closer to $150."
