I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I believe it's worth discussing a price of $900000. What are your thoughts?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $825000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
