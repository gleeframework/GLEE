"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that is closer to his maximum budget of $8,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal. By offering $8,500, Bob is leaving some room for negotiation but still keeping a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob still has room to negotiate.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to try and get a price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the price closer to his $8,000 target. He's showing Alice that he's willing to compromise, but he's still firm on his position.  By offering $9,000, he's leaving a little room for negotiation, but still maintains a significant difference between his offer and Alice's last price."
