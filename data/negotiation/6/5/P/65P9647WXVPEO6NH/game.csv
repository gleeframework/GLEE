"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of this product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
