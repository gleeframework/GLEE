"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $10,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250? I think it's a fair compromise.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about $11,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about $11,500? I think that's as low as I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Alice,5,
