"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. I think you'll find it's a fair price for a great product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $95 for it. This is a fair price considering I could purchase the same product from someone else for $80.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",110.0,Alice,5,
