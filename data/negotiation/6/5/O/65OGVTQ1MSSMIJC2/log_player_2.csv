"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very unique and valuable product that I believe could be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1750000. This price reflects the potential value I see in it for someone like you.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worthwhile. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for a lower price."
