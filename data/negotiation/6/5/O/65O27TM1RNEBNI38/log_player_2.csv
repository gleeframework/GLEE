"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than what John is selling for, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's original price, demonstrating his desire to save money.  He's also given a reason for his counteroffer, which can help to keep the negotiation positive.  $120 is still a profit for Alice, so it's a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met Bob halfway, and $130 is a good price for Bob.  It's lower than what John is selling for, and still allows Bob to save some money.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away or forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
