"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation.  This price is below Bob's perceived value but leaves room for potential counteroffers.  I want to gauge his interest and see how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm willing to continue the negotiation and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still within my desired range. I'm hoping this will be seen as a reasonable compromise and encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's within my acceptable range, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale for $800,000 with John, so this offer provides a significant improvement over that."
