"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, the value this product brings warrants a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects my desire to reach a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your understanding of the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,012,500?  I believe this represents significant movement on my part while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I propose a price of $900,000. I think this is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,6,
