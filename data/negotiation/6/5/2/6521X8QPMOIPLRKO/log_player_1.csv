Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is way too high.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me and $1,000,000 to you.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try and get a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to try and push for a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise.  I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,000,000, which is what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This way, both of us are happy and we can close this deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob is unwilling to go higher than $950,000, and I'm not willing to drop my price any further. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time."
