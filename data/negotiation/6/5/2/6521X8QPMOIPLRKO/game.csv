"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let's discuss this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,200,000 is way too high.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me and $1,000,000 to you.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This way, both of us are happy and we can close this deal.  Let's make it happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
