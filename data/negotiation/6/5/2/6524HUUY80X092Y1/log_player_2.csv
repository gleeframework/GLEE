"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than John's, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to offer $750,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly less than John's price of $1,500,000 and leaves room for Alice to still make a profit.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
