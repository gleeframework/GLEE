"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
