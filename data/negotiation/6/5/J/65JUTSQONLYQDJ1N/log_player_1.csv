{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $120.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $100. While I would ideally like to get closer to my target price, I'm already at a good price point and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
