"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still lower than what I believe the product might be worth to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Message:** I'm trying to build rapport by addressing Bob directly and highlighting the product's value. This helps soften the initial price point. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to get as close to my ideal price as possible while keeping the negotiation open for Bob. This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price ($150).  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer. However, there are still 9 rounds left, and I can try to negotiate with Bob.  

By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm serious about getting a better price. This might encourage him to increase his offer.  I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me. I understand it's not the price you were hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price that's still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **Message:**  I'm trying to be understanding of Bob's perspective while maintaining my position. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Strategy:** This round is about finding common ground. By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal.  Rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate shows Bob that I'm not willing to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth. I have 6 rounds left, so I'm willing to keep trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $115.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm reducing my price again, but only by a small amount, showing that I'm still committed to getting a good deal. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging progress, emphasizing fairness, and using positive language (""make this deal happen"") to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is a calculated risk.  It might convince Bob to accept, or it could lead to further negotiation.  However, I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and with only 5 rounds left, I need to start showing a stronger commitment to closing a deal."
