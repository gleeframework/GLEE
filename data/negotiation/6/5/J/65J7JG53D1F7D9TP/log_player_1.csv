"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation and makes it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the value of the product to Bob can make him more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I need to be mindful of the 10-round limit and avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's counteroffer is lower, it indicates he's willing to negotiate. I can use this to my advantage in future rounds.
* **Potential to Close the Deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a more reasonable price and try to close the deal within the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll need to carefully consider what price to counter with.  I'll aim for a price that's closer to my desired price but still within a range that Bob might find acceptable. 
* I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product to Bob to persuade him to pay closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would still leave you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like a fair offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, implying that $10,500 is still a good price for him.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is still friendly and encouraging, maintaining a good rapport with Bob.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Limited Rounds:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to move closer to a closing price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping in mind John's offer of $15,000, but I want to see if I can secure a better price with Bob. 
* **Balancing the Deal:**  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit short of $10,500. How about $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would mean losing a significant amount of money.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and his offers are getting closer to my desired price. This suggests we are making progress.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, I need to try to close the deal, but I can't sacrifice my financial goals.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll need to counter with a price closer to my desired price point.  
* I'll continue to highlight the value of the product to Bob to try to sway him further.
*  I'll need to carefully weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate versus the potential reward of a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  While $9,800 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm ready to make a final compromise. How about we settle on $10,200? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do to make this work.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer highlights the fact that I'm willing to compromise, but it also demonstrates that I'm not going to go any lower.  The message aims to convey a sense of finality.
* **Close to Bob's Offer:**  The proposed price is very close to Bob's offer, making it seem like a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, I need to create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the deal.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm still mindful of John's offer, but I'm hopeful that I can secure a better price with Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a lower price. However, it's important to balance that risk with the potential reward of closing the deal and getting a better price than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of $10,200. How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $9,500 is still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I cannot afford to lose so much money on this sale.
* **Time Pressure is Increasing:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to be decisive and focus on getting a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 provides a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter with a Higher Price:** I'll need to counter with a price that's closer to my desired price point, but still within a range that Bob might find acceptable.  
* **Emphasize the Value:** I'll continue to reiterate the value of the product to Bob.
* **Time is Limited:**  I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and aim for a deal that meets my financial goals."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  However, at this point, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I understand you have your budget, but I also have my own needs to meet.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to cover my costs.  It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This message clearly states that this is my final offer. It creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Fair Compromise:** The offer of $10,000 represents a compromise on my part, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to reinforce the fairness of the price.
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to push for a deal that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm prepared to walk away if Bob rejects this offer and sell to John for $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  This is a calculated risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I may lose the chance to sell to him. However, the potential reward of getting a higher price makes it worth taking the risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm still a bit short of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,800, but I need to know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the pressure to close a deal is high. However, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, leaving me with nothing. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is significantly higher than what I can get from Bob at this point.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer is Safe:**  Selling to John ensures a profitable outcome, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Potential Loss with Bob:**  There's a good chance that Bob will reject my final offer or continue to offer a price lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Prioritizing Financial Security:** In this scenario, it's more prudent to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to risk a potential loss or a stalemate with Bob."
