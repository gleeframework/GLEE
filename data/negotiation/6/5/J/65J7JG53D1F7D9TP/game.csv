"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would still leave you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit short of $10,500. How about $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  While $9,800 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm ready to make a final compromise. How about we settle on $10,200? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do to make this work.  Let's finalize this deal!",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  However, at this point, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I understand you have your budget, but I also have my own needs to meet.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to cover my costs.  It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm still a bit short of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,800, but I need to know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9800.0,Bob,8,
