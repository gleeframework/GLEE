"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm happy to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $120, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
