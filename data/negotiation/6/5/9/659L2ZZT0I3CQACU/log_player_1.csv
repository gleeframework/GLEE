I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation and a good deal for Bob.  It also gives me a good starting point for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good profit for me. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's value for the product and his previous counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my target, Bob's latest offer is still too low. I will make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my target with further negotiation."

I'm offering the product for $1,125,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. I believe it's still a good price for both of us, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000. While I would have preferred to get a higher price from Bob, the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds and Bob seems unwilling to move much closer to my target price.  It's time to secure a sale, and John is offering a guaranteed $800,000, which is still a substantial amount."
