"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $82.50? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
