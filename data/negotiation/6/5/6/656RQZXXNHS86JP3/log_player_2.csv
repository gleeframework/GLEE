"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $110, so I'll offer it to you for $130. What do you think?

This counteroffer continues to move closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments, signaling that I'm still looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 was still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you the product for $125, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125, and I'm not willing to pay more than John's price. It's time to cut my losses and get the product for the price I'm comfortable with."
