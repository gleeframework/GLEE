{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's potential for a compromise.
* **It shows you're serious:**  A strong initial offer demonstrates your confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. I would like to counteroffer at $8,800. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,800 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your latest offer carefully. I would like to counteroffer at $9,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $9,200.  It's also significantly higher than what John is offering ($8,000).  Accepting this offer is the best course of action to maximize my profit."
