"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already mentioned that I'm not willing to go below $150. I can offer you a compromise at $140, which is a $10 discount from my initial offer. Is that something you'd be interested in?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $130, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $130, which is $135. I think that's a fair price for this great product. Is that something you'd be interested in?",135.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can offer you $140 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus or warranty to sweeten the deal. If that's still not enough, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",140.0,Alice,7,
