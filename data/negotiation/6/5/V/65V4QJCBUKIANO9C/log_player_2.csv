Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $750,000. I understand that's a bit lower than what I initially proposed, but I'm willing to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some more, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is still a good profit for me. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm, and while we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $875,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
