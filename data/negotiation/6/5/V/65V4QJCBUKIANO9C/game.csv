"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down a bit? I'm thinking closer to $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $750,000. I understand that's a bit lower than what I initially proposed, but I'm willing to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some more, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is still a good profit for me. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",875000.0,Alice,5,
