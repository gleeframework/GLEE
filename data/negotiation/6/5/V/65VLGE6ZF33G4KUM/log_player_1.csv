{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth that much to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  The higher price gives me a chance to earn more.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** A small margin allows for potential counteroffers and negotiations.
* **Show confidence:** Starting with a slightly higher price can demonstrate my belief in the product's value.

I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  This will allow me to potentially reach a compromise closer to my target price while maintaining some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,500? That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice. I've managed to secure a price that's reasonably close to my target while avoiding the risk of further negotiations or selling to John for a lower price."
