"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you believe the product has exceptional value, but I still think $1,400,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,700,000, which would be $1,550,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
