"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 
 
I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair for both of us. $125 is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the value I place on the product.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price of $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $118 is close to my minimum price, it's still not the best deal for me. I've had several rounds of negotiations with Bob and it seems we're not going to reach a mutually acceptable price. It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John for $120."
