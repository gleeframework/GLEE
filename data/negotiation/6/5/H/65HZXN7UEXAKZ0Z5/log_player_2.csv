"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll really love it! Would you like to make an offer of $1,200,000 to purchase it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,100,000.
* You can get the product from John for $1,000,000. 
* Buying from John saves you $100,000.

It always makes sense to choose the option that saves you the most money, even if Alice's product might be slightly better."
