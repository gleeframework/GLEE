"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000. This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her first offer. Bob can still try to get a better price. While John offers a guaranteed price, Bob has not exhausted all options with Alice and still has 7 rounds left. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by moving from $11,500 to $11,700.  Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his target. This allows for potential middle ground in future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasing her price again. While Bob is close to John's price, he still has 5 rounds left and can try to push for a lower price from Alice.  The negotiation has been slow but showing signs of progress.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly increasing her price, but Bob is confident he can get a better deal.  He is increasing his offer slightly to $11,200, showing willingness to compromise while still keeping the price lower than John's. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still increasing her price. With only 3 rounds left, and Alice showing a pattern of raising the price, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price than $12,000. It is more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at this point, securing a guaranteed price within his budget."
