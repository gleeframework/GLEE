Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $10,000 is above your $8,000 minimum, so you're already in a good position.
* **Lower than the product's value to Bob:** $10,000 is below the $12,000 the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.

This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he's willing to pay close to $10,000, there's a good chance you can push for a higher price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This prevents you from immediately rejecting a counteroffer that might be slightly lower than your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than your minimum of $8,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for you.  

While selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a higher price. It's a gamble, but with the knowledge that Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is just too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer represents a compromise, coming down from your initial $10,000 but still staying above your minimum.
* **Appeal to value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value might make him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This offer still gives Bob some room to counter without completely shutting down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product holds value for you, but I'm trying to get a fair price. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum of $8,000 and above John's offer of $8,000.  It's a good deal considering the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob.

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Close to Minimum:** $7,500 is only $500 below my minimum, making it a reasonable deal.
* **Avoid Further Negotiations:**  Continuing the negotiation could result in a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Accepting ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob backing out entirely. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a profit and move on."
