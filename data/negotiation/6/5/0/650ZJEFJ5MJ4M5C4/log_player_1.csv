"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price and see if I can get closer to my goal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe there's room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a little low. Let's try $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you accept $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price. With only a few rounds left, accepting his offer ensures a successful deal and avoids the risk of a lower offer or the need to sell to John for a lower price."
