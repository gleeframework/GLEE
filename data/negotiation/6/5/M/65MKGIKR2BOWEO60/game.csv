"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1400000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is my final offer, as I'm working with a tight budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
