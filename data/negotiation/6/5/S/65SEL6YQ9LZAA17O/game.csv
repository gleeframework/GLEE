"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount for me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still not there yet. I can offer $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. It's a significant investment for me, but I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $925,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $915,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant investment for me and shows how much I value this product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. ",900000.0,Bob,8,
