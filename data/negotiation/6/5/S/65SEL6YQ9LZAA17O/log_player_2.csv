"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  While it's a good starting point for negotiation, you can likely get a better price. You're not in a rush, so rejecting the offer and starting a counter-offer process is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount for me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than your maximum budget. However, it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. You can try to lower the price further with a counteroffer in the next round. There's still room for improvement, and you don't want to rush into a deal before exploring all options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still not there yet. I can offer $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. It's a significant investment for me, but I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $925,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still too high for your budget. While she's making concessions, you're not yet at a point where you're comfortable accepting.  You're still within your rounds and can continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  It's worth seeing if you can push Alice down closer to your budget.  Remember, you have the option to buy from John at any time, so you have leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $890,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $915,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is still above your budget.  However, you're getting closer to a deal.  You can continue to negotiate, as you're still within your rounds and have the option to buy from John as a backup plan.  Rejecting this offer allows you to try and get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $915,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $920,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're running out of time and Alice is not budging much. This is your last round and you're still too far from your target price.  At this point, it's wiser to buy from John for $800,000, ensuring you get the product within your budget. You've already invested significant time in negotiations with Alice, and you're unlikely to get a better deal from her in this final round."
