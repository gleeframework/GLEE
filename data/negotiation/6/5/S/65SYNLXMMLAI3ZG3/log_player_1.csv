Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's a bit above my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'm going to try and negotiate a bit more with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to $150 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $135? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $125. I think this is a fair price considering the original price was $150 and I've already come down from my initial offer of $120. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but they're still not quite there. I'd rather take the guaranteed $150 from John than risk another few rounds of negotiation with Bob."
