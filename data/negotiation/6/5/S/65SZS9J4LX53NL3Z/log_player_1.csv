"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. If Bob rejects, we'll see how high he's willing to go. I'm also keeping in mind the $10,000 safety net from John, so I won't settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I think I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still holding onto a bit more value.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $14,200 is now getting very close to what I'm willing to settle for. It's only $300 less than my last counteroffer, and I don't want to risk going too many rounds and ending up with John's lower offer."
