"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $90. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
