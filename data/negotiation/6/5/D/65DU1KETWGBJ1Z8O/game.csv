"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. ",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $11,500? This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  ",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to come down another $500, and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
