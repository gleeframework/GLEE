Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing to negotiate or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product above $85."
