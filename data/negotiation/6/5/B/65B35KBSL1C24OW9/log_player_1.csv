Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original price and my target price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or John."
