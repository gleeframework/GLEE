# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. I need to negotiate to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm comfortable with. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, but I think it's the lowest I can go. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to try to reach an agreement with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm comfortable with. I believe there's room for further negotiation before I consider accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,200 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I've negotiated for several rounds and haven't been able to get Alice down to my desired price. Therefore, it's more efficient to purchase the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiations."
