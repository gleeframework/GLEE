Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a compromise.  It's higher than what Bob considers the product worth, but lower than what I can get from John.  This increases the likelihood that Bob will accept, as he'll still save $500 compared to buying from John, while I still earn more than if I sold to John."
