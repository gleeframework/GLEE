"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, but $1,300,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about $1,600,000? This price still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,450,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's within my means.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense we're not too far apart. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work.  Let's close this out and get this product into your hands where it truly belongs. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,550,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,525,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,525,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but only if you can reach $1,537,500.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll be forced to move on to other buyers. Time is running out, and I need to make a decision soon.",1537500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm afraid $1,537,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my means. My final offer is $1,525,000. I'm not willing to go any higher.",1525000.0,Bob,8,
