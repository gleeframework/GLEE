Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is not terrible, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'm willing to give Bob another chance, but I will need to come back with a counteroffer that reflects the product's value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, but $1,300,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. I'm willing to compromise, however.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,450,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's within my means.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,450,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling below my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer, but if we can't reach an agreement soon, I'm prepared to move on to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the sense we're not too far apart. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,550,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,525,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal and get the money,  $1,525,000 is still below my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer, but I'm also getting closer to considering selling to John if we can't come to an agreement.  I need to maximize my profits."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,525,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but only if you can reach $1,537,500.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

It's getting late in the game and Bob is sticking to his price.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, I'm running out of time, and I'm not sure I can get Bob to budge.  It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price."
