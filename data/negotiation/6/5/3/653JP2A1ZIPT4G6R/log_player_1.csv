Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $10500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target, I think I can still push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $10,800 and my desired $11,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $10700? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm getting close to my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my desired range and it's a good deal considering we're nearing the end of our negotiations. It's better to secure a sale than risk further haggling and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
