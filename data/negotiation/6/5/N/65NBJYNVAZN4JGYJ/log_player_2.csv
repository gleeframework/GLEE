"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  I value it highly, but I'm open to a mutually beneficial agreement.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  It's too early to buy from John, who is selling at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to let it go for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still able to get a better deal by counteroffering. Buying from John at this point is still too expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,300,000.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference - $1,325,000, and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could continue to negotiate, the price is getting close to his maximum.  Accepting the offer now ensures a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
