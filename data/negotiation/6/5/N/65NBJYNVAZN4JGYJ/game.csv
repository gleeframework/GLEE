"Alice,  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to let it go for $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,300,000.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference - $1,325,000, and we have a deal?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
