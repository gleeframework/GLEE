Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product at a price of $1,400,000. This price reflects its value and represents a significant opportunity for you.  I believe it's a fair offer considering its worth to you, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a little lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as an opportunity for Bob and highlighting the fairness of the price. 
* **Openness:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation to keep Bob engaged. 

**Strategy:** 

* I'm aiming for a price that's as close as possible to my minimum, but still appealing to Bob.
* By starting with a lower price, I might be able to get Bob to accept quickly, and I'm prepared to counter if he makes a lower offer.
* If the negotiation doesn't go well, I have the option of selling to John at my minimum price, providing a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000. Accepting it would mean losing a considerable amount of money.  

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation is key:**  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. 
* **Finding middle ground:** My counteroffer will aim for a price that's closer to my desired price but still within a range that Bob might consider. 
* **Safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob ultimately fails, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,050,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,250,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a more reasonable profit.  Let me know if this is something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). 
* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that even at this price, he's getting a product worth $1,200,000 to him. 

**Strategy:**

* **Bridge the gap:** By offering a price in the middle, I'm hoping to find a point where Bob feels it's worth his while to accept.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still not accepting a price that's significantly below my minimum, keeping some leverage in case the negotiations continue.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if needed, but I'm aiming for a deal closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,150,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Accepting this offer would mean losing a substantial amount of money, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired price but still open to some negotiation. 
* **Find a compromise:**  I'll aim for a price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel comfortable with the deal. 
* **Safety net:**  I'll keep my option of selling to John for $1,500,000 in mind, providing me with a fallback position."
