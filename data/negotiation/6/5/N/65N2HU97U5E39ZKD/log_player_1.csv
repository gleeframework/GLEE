Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal depends on negotiation tactics and how much information you're willing to reveal.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the given values, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor, Potential Negotiation:** Start with a high offer significantly above Bob's valuation, hoping to anchor his perception of the product's value. This leaves room for negotiation but risks losing the sale.
2. **Accept John's Offer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your desired price, you can bypass negotiation with Bob entirely.

**Recommended Offer (Option 1)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and market potential, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,800,000 price is significantly above Bob's valuation, creating a strong anchor.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" nature, ""value,"" and ""market potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This high price leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to his $1,200,000 maximum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  If Bob is risk-averse, this high offer might deter him. 
* **Your Time Sensitivity:** If you need to close the deal quickly, accepting John's offer is safer.
* **Relationship Building:**  A more aggressive negotiation style might impact your future relationship with Bob.
