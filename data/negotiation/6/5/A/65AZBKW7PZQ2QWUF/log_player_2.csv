"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above its market price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate down, as there's a good chance you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low, Counter High:** Starting with a significantly lower offer than my target allows room for negotiation.  
* **Psychological Impact:** A low initial offer might encourage Alice to reconsider her pricing. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have John's offer of $8,000 as a fallback if Alice completely rejects my counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I could consider a price of $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $11,000 is still considerably higher than my target and John's offer.  Continued negotiation is worthwhile to see if I can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to make a deal today if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but not making a huge jump. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding ""ready to make a deal today"" might encourage Alice to accept, especially if she's motivated to sell quickly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is a good middle ground between my initial offer and her current one. It keeps me in the negotiation while moving closer to a potentially acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your time.  I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $9,500.  This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her best price and she has another potential buyer. 
* **Above Budget:** Even with her final offer, $9,500 is still significantly above your $8,000 maximum and John's guaranteed offer. 
* **No Guarantee of Success:**  Further negotiation isn't likely to result in a price you're willing to pay, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
