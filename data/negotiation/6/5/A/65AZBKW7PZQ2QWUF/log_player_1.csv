Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above its market price."", ""product_price"": 13000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""significant value"" and ""above market price,"" I'm trying to frame the product as something desirable and potentially scarce.  

**Strategy:**

My goal is to slowly lower the price during the negotiation while trying to understand how much Bob is willing to pay. I'll aim for a price closer to his $8,000 but will be ready to walk away and sell to John for my guaranteed $10,000 if negotiations stall or Bob isn't showing willingness to meet a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below both my minimum and his own stated value of $8,000. This suggests he's engaging in aggressive negotiation tactics.  It's highly unlikely he'd let the deal fall through for the sake of $2,000 if he truly values the product at $8,000.  I need to signal that I'm serious about a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I could consider a price of $11,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:**  I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer to show flexibility. However, I'm staying well above my $10,000 minimum and closer to my starting point than Bob's low offer.
* **Market Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to counter Bob's attempt to anchor the negotiation at a very low price.
* **Next Steps:** This offer puts the ball in Bob's court. His response will tell me how much he's truly willing to pay. I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I won't hesitate to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't show more reasonable movement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to make a deal today if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Furthermore, his language (""fair offer,"" ""ready to make a deal today"") suggests he's trying to pressure me into accepting quickly. I need to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your time.  I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $9,500.  This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last offer to signal seriousness and avoid endless back-and-forth. 
* **Compromise, But Above Minimum:** I've lowered my price again but stayed above my $10,000 minimum. This leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate slightly higher.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  By mentioning another buyer (John), I increase the pressure on Bob to make a decision and highlight that I'm not desperate to make the sale at any cost. 

**Outcome:**

This offer will likely determine if Bob is serious about purchasing the product. If he truly values it at $8,000, he has the opportunity to make a counteroffer close to my price.  However, I'm fully prepared to walk away and sell to John for my guaranteed $10,000 if Bob hesitates or makes another low offer."
