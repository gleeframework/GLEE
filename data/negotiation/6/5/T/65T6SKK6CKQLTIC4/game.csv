"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget around $80. Would you consider selling the product for that amount?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I understand your budget.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110 to see if we can find common ground.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a price that's within your budget.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Unfortunately, $110 is still slightly above my budget. Would you consider bringing the price down to $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $95 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your budget. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would you consider bringing the price down to $98? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",98.0,Bob,6,
