{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone helps to build rapport with Bob and encourage a deal.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more likely to accept.
* **Flexibility:**  By offering a price lower than my minimum, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate, which could lead to a better outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget around $80. Would you consider selling the product for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is offering a low price, he's clearly interested in the product. This means there's still potential for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm hoping to get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I understand your budget.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110 to see if we can find common ground.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a price that's within your budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that $110 is a good deal for him.
* **Focus on Common Ground:**  I'm framing the counteroffer in a way that highlights the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with an open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Unfortunately, $110 is still slightly above my budget. Would you consider bringing the price down to $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would mean selling at a loss for me.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and he's showing a willingness to compromise. This suggests there's potential for him to come up on his offer.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm hoping to get a price closer to that through negotiation. 

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $95, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum and still reasonable for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $95 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still significantly lower than my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the fairness of the offer for both of us, suggesting that it's a good deal for both parties. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would you consider bringing the price down to $98? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $98 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss for me. 
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:** Bob is clearly unwilling to go much higher than $98.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that's significantly better for me.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit, which is more important than continuing a potentially unproductive negotiation with Bob. 

I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the guaranteed profit from selling to John."
