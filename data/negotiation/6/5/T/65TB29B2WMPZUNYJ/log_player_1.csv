Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** By offering a price slightly above my minimum, I'm aiming to maximize my profit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay more. 
* **Back-up Plan:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000, so I'm not taking a significant risk.

Ultimately, I'm hoping that Bob values the product enough to pay more than $8,000."
