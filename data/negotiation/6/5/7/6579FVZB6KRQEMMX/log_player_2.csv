# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  He should start negotiating with Alice to see if they can reach a more agreeable price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial price, it's still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his limit."
