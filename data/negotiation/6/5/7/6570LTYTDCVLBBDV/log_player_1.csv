Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's my guaranteed profit with John.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  Offering it at $110 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80), but it's still a potential saving for him compared to me selling it to John.
* **First Refusal Strategy:** By emphasizing this is a ""special price"" just for him, it might make Bob more inclined to accept before I go to another buyer."
