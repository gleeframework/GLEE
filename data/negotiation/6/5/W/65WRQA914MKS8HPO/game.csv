"Thanks for starting the conversation, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price, closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $10,750. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,600. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,7,
