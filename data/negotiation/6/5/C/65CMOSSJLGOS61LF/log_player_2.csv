"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This item holds immense value and significance, not just monetarily but also in terms of its unique features and potential impact on your endeavors. Given its importance to both of us, I propose a purchase price of $950000. This offer reflects a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic worth to you and its value to me, aiming to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can bring this exceptional product into your possession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than buying from John, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000).  This means there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially push Alice to lower the price further or explore other options."
