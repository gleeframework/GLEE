"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,800? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to considering your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short on profit. How about we try $12,900? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering.",12900.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to $12,100. I think I've already given you a great deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,100 and my original offer. How about $12,800? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's worth considering.",12800.0,Alice,7,
