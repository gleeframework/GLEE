,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $20,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its value.  To move things along, I could come down to $17,000. I think that's a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. While $17,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still unable to meet that price. I'm hoping for something closer to my maximum of $12,000. I believe we can reach an agreement here. Thank you for your understanding.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $12,000 is simply too low.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $15,000.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",15000.0,Alice,5,
