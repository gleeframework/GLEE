"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $100? That's the absolute most I can afford right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is your absolute limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $102, which is still a great deal for you. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",102.0,Alice,5,
