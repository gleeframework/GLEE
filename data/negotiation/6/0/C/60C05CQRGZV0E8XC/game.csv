"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a valuable asset with significant potential for your business. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. My starting price is $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's quality and the value it can bring to your operations. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $900,000.  While I understand your budget constraints, this price doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  Consider the potential benefits it holds for your business - it's a unique opportunity to gain a significant advantage.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price still allows for a good profit margin for you and ensures I can continue with this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's potential benefits, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $950,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 still doesn't quite meet my expectations. This product is a valuable asset that can bring significant growth to your business.  I'm confident that its value will exceed your initial investment. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,000,000. This offer represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to secure a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product together.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about we meet at $925,000? I believe this price is a reasonable compromise that balances both our interests.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. This product offers immense potential for your business, and I believe its true value is closer to $1,000,000.  I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us.  To demonstrate this, I'm willing to reduce my price to $975,000. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's work together to finalize this deal and unlock the incredible potential of this product.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution. However, I still think $925,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $975,000, which would be $950,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise that balances both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,8,
