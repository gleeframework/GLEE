You can do better than $90.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

I'm offering $85, which is still within my budget and a good starting point for negotiation.  Let's see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but I'm still not willing to pay that much.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $88.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to go above my $90 limit.  Let's see if Alice will accept this compromise."

Alice's offer is getting too high. It's not worth continuing this negotiation. I'm going to buy from John for $120, as it's still within my budget and I don't want to risk going even higher with Alice."
