Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $90.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $85 is higher than my minimum price of $80, I'll consider accepting his offer. However, since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. Let me think for a moment...

I'll decide to... REJECT Bob's offer!

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $85, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $92.
