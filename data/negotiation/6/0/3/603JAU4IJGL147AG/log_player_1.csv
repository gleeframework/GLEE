Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $9,500.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize your profit. Offering the product at $9,500 leaves you with a significant profit margin while still making it attractive enough for Bob to accept.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer willing to pay $8,000, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob declines. 

By starting with a strong offer close to Bob's maximum valuation, you increase your chances of securing the best possible price."
