"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a lower price. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $13,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you the product for $12,800. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",12800.0,Alice,7,
