"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer of $11,000 is good, it's still possible to get a lower price. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a smart move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. While Alice has moved closer to his target, it's still possible to negotiate further. With 7 rounds remaining, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for maximizing savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $10,250. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $10,400. It's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice's offer of $10,400 is closer to Bob's desired price of $10,000 than his previous offer.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  There are only 5 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower price, but it's also risky, as time is running out.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John would cost $12,000. Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,600.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer provides a good balance between savings and the risk of not reaching an agreement in the remaining rounds."
