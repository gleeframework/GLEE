"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $10,250. What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $10,400. It's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10400.0,Alice,5,
