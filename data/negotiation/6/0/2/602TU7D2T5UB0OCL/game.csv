"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $18,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a significant reduction from your original offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. I believe this offer is a good compromise and allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
