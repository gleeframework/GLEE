"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering it's worth $15,000 to you. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $12,000, so this is your chance to get it for a great price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Here's how to decide:

* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
* **Your Max:** $15,000
* **John's Offer:** $15,000

While Alice's offer is a bit high, it's still less than your maximum and cheaper than John's offer. 

**Therefore:** {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** You save $1,000 compared to buying from John. Alice is using some sales tactics (mentioning other buyers, inflating the worth to you), but the price is still within your acceptable range."
