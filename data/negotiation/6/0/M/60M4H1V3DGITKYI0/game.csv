,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?  That's my best offer right now.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm feeling confident with my last offer of $9,500.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if you're willing to accept it.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,800, Bob. That's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. Would you be willing to meet me there?",9800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,800. I'm getting closer to my target. How about we split the difference and go with $9,650?  It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I think it's a price that we can both agree on.",9650.0,Bob,8,
