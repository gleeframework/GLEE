"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still above my comfortable spending limit. I'm confident that this product can bring substantial value to my business, but I'm committed to staying within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which reflects a significant concession on my part.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
