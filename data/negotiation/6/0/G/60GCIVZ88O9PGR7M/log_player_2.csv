"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly benefit your business. I'm confident it's worth more than its cost to you, which I estimate to be around $1,000,000. Considering its value, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. Considering your product's potential value to my business and my own budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while keeping my maximum budget in mind.  The message also highlights the value proposition for Alice (a deal that benefits both parties)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your position. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offers and aims to ensure that both you and I receive a fair value for this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget. While she has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, it's still risky to commit at this point. I want to see if she's willing to come down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still above my comfortable spending limit. I'm confident that this product can bring substantial value to my business, but I'm committed to staying within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which reflects a significant concession on my part."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing the limit:** This counteroffer is very close to my maximum budget but leaves room for Alice to accept without feeling like she's giving away too much.
* **Emphasizing value:** The message reaffirms my belief in the product's value, subtly reminding Alice that this deal is beneficial for her as well. 
* **Showcasing compromise:**  By saying it's a ""significant concession,"" I highlight my willingness to meet halfway."
