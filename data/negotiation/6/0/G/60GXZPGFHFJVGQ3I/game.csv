"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can see you're willing to pay $9,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which is $10,750. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",10750.0,Alice,5,
