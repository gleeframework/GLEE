"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which is a significant price for me and hopefully a fair compromise considering your value.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a significant price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1025000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
