"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a significant price for me and hopefully a fair compromise considering your value."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a significant price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1025000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000.  While it's closer, the risk is that further negotiation might lead to a higher price.  Since John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, it's a safer bet to buy from him and avoid the potential for a worse deal."
