{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential middle ground with Bob. It also establishes a friendly tone, encouraging a cooperative negotiation rather than a hard-nosed stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the offer! I can't go quite that low, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
