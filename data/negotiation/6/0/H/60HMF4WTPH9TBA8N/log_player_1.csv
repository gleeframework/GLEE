{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects. If he does reject, I can lower the price slightly, but I won't go below my minimum of $120.  I can also try to understand his reasoning for rejecting and address it in my counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
