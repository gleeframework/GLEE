Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects its unique value and potential.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950,000 for the item. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price, especially since I know it's worth $1,000,000 to him. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? It's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I can offer $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,050,000 is a good deal considering it's above my minimum of $1,000,000, and it's only four rounds into the negotiation.  It's a good outcome and a win for both of us."
