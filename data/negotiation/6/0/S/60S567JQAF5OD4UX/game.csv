"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $800000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think that $1000000 is a more realistic price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $1000000, so I'm going to counteroffer at $925000. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's truly my final offer.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll need to move on to another option.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think that you're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I'm not going to go any higher. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",950000.0,Alice,7,
