"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:** Accepting Alice's offer means you'll pay $900,000, which is $100,000 less than buying from John. 
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, you're still getting it for less than your maximum price point of $1,000,000."
