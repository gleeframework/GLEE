{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, as I don't know Bob's valuation. I'll be ready to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm still holding out for a better price. I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, but I believe there's potential to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little too low for me.  How about $15,000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $13000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close enough to my minimum of $12,000, and it's worth it to avoid further negotiation.  It's possible I could squeeze out a bit more, but the risk of further delays and the possibility of Bob backing out completely isn't worth the potential gain."
