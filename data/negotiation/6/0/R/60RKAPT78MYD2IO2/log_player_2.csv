"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Alice's offer of $8,750 is within his budget and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob might prefer a lower price, Alice's counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With limited rounds, accepting a good offer now minimizes the risk of losing the product to another buyer or running out of time."
