Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  My message emphasizes the deal's value for Bob, highlighting the potential savings.
* **Flexibility:**  This offer allows for potential counteroffers and leaves room for me to adjust my price if necessary. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. I would like to counteroffer at $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap. It's also possible that Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly if he sees I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. This demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation while still holding my ground.
* **Positive language:**  The message is optimistic and emphasizes the win-win aspect of the proposed deal.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's make this happen"" adds a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and reaching a deal with Bob.  I'm hopeful that this will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $13,200 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to you and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm concerned that going back and forth could prolong the process and potentially lead to further concessions that would ultimately leave me dissatisfied. 

I've already established a reliable buyer in John, who is willing to pay my desired price.  Rather than risk further negotiations with Bob, it's in my best interest to sell to John and secure the maximum value for my product."
