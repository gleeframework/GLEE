"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,025,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
