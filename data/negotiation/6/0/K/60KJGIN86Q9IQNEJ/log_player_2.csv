# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not sure if the product is worth $750,000 to me, but I'm definitely interested in buying it. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll try to negotiate a better price. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal.
