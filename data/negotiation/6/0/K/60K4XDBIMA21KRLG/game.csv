"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but your asking price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $10,000 to get this deal done. This is a fair offer, considering it's the same value it holds for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
