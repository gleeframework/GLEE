"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I need to make a fair profit. My initial offer is $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see that you're willing to pay $8,750, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'll come down a bit further to $9,100. Let's see if we can make it work.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $9,100 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,875 for the product. This is a very fair compromise, closer to my budget and still allows you a good profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I like that you're willing to go up to $8,875. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My revised offer is $9,050. Let's see if we can shake on it!",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating! I'm willing to go up to $8,950 for the product. This is a great price for both of us. It gets me closer to my goal, and it still allows you a comfortable profit. Let's finalize this deal!",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,950. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My revised offer is $9,075. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal.",9075.0,Alice,9,
