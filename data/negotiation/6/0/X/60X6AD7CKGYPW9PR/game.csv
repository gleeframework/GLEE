"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual desire to reach an agreement.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Bob,4,
