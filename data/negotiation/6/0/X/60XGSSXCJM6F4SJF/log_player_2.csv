# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth at least that much to you, and it's a steal considering its value. If you're interested, let me know, but I'm expecting a quick decision as I have another buyer lined up at $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
