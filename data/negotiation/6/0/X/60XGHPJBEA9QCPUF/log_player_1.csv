Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter-offer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified without explicitly stating its worth to you.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** Showing flexibility and willingness to discuss the price (""open to discussing further..."") encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process. It signals that you're aiming for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
