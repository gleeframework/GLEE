"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's lowball offer of $1,000,000. It's significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'm confident we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  Let's try $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure it's still a good deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. I can do $1,200,000, but that's the best I can offer.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum threshold, and considering we're in the 6th round and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from him, I'll accept his offer."
