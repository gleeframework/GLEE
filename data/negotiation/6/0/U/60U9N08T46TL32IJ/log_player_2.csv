"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1200000.  I'm confident this price will be a win-win for both of us. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer is above your desired price range ($1,500,000). While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product's potential. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which would still give you a healthy profit while being more within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can work together on this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is a good starting point, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This price gives us both a fair return on the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is still above your desired price range. You can likely negotiate further and get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation process."

This offers a significant gain for you while remaining within my financial limitations. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
