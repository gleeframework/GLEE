"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
