"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fantastic price, considering its value to me is at least $1200000. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value to you is $1200000, I'd be willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price that allows you to profit while still getting me a good deal. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to profit from the sale. Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $1280000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to profit from the sale. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
