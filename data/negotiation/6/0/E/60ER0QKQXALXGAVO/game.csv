,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $13,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is your maximum, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
