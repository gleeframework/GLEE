**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Even though you could get a better deal from John in terms of saving money, Alice's offer is still within your budget of $1,500,000 and saves you $400,000 compared to John's price. 
* **Focus on the immediate gain:**  While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, the goal is to acquire the product at the lowest possible price within your budget. Accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
