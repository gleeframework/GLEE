"Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1350000 to make this deal work.  This represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1350000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $1300000.  This reflects a fair value for me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
