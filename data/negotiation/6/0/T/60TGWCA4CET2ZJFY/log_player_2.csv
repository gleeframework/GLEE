"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $900,000, and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer sets a strong starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and the price could go back up.  Accepting Alice's current offer ensures a good price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
