"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $750000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $825000. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Alice, but I still think $800000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $785000. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",785000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $795000. This is the final offer I can make, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",795000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $795000. I'm willing to meet you at $790000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but it's going to be a small one. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $792500. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",792500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $785000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. I'm hoping you'll reconsider and meet me at $785000.",785000.0,Bob,10,
