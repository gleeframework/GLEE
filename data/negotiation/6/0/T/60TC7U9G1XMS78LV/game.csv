"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and high demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is fair considering my needs and the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While $12,000 is a common price point, this product truly offers exceptional value that justifies a higher investment. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $13,500, which is a fair compromise, and it's still within my budget.  What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle on $14,250? This feels like a fair deal that reflects the value of the product.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $14,250 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $13,750, which is a fair compromise and represents a significant saving for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",13750.0,Bob,6,
