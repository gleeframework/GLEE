"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, say around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit away from that price point. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $790,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",790000.0,Alice,7,
