"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can we meet in the middle at $157.50?",157.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $157.50 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $162.50? That's still a great deal for a product worth $150 to you, and it's closer to my desired price.",162.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $162.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $157.50, so how about we try $159.75?",159.75,Bob,4,
