{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still gives him room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be closer to my minimum. I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. Bob is getting closer, but I believe I can push for a better deal. I will counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, offering the product for $875,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. Let's see if we can make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $860,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. While we're getting closer, I'm concerned that further negotiations will only prolong the process and potentially result in a lower final price.  To ensure I secure a profitable deal, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
