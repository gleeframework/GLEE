"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as I can still make a good profit, and you get a valuable product at a discounted price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $11,500 is more than you are willing to pay.  You can get the same product from John for $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best decision."
