"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and leaves me with a solid profit. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1200000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This still leaves a profit for me, and it's a fair compromise considering your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1250000 is still significantly below what I need.  Let's try one more time:  I'm willing to come down to $1280000.  This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not willing to pay $1280000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
