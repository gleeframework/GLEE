"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you presenting this product.  However, $950,000 is above my initial target.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This offer reflects a balance between our positions and ensures a fair deal for both parties.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the potential of the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
