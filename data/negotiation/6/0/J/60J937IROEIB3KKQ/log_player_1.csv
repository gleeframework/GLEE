Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $110. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.  I believe this price is reasonable and might convince Bob to accept."
