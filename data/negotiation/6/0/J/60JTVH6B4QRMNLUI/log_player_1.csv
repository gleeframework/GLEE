Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and highlights the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being too aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counter if he wants. 

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth negotiating further. 
* **John as backup:** I'll keep John's offer of $150 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall or go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This indicates there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'll keep John's offer of $150 in mind, but I'd prefer to get a better price if possible.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still within my acceptable range.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion if Bob wants to counter again. 

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll closely consider his next move. If he rejects, I'll reassess my options, including John's offer.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I'm ready to continue negotiating if it seems like we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome. 
* **John's offer is secure:** John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing a sale.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag the process out, potentially delaying the sale and leaving me with no guaranteed income. 

**Next steps:**

* **Contact John:** I will reach out to John and finalize the sale. 
* **Move on:** I'll move on from Bob and consider other potential buyers in the future."
