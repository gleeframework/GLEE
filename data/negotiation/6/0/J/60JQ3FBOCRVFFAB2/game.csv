"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm ready to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $95 for the product. This is a bit closer to your budget while still allowing us to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
