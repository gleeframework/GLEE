"Hey Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $85. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down. $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $89.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",89.0,Alice,5,
