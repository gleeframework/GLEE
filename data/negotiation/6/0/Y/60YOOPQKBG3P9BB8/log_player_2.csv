"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price.  What do you say to a price of $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. You can get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to maximize your savings."
