Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $90."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 allows for potential negotiation while ensuring you're above your minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John at $80, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
