Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have some leverage.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This price is significantly above Bob's valuation but leaves room for him to potentially negotiate down. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob is likely to counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Time Sensitivity:** You could subtly imply you have other interested buyers to encourage Bob to decide quickly."
