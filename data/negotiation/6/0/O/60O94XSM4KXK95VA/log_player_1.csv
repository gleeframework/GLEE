"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves me with a good profit even if I have to lower the price a bit. I'm also considering the possibility of going to John, so I want to be reasonably close to that $15,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher.  There are still rounds left and the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 is too good to pass up at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. This price is halfway between my minimum threshold and Bob's last offer, which might encourage him to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $13,500 is still not enough.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to go higher.  I'm aware that I have a safety net with John, and I'm not willing to give up that much money for a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

This is my final compromise. I'm dropping my price to $15,500, which is just above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'm confident that I can sell it to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low. While I'm still holding out for a higher price, with only four rounds left I'm not confident I can get him to come up to my minimum. It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid the risk of losing more money in negotiations."
