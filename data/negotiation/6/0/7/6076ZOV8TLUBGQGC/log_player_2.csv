"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's beneficial to reject and counteroffer to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to consider a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than Bob's maximum budget. While it's tempting to accept, Bob has a better option in John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially secure a better price. If he can't get lower, he can always buy from John for his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm offering the product to you for $1,210,000. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob has a guaranteed option of buying the product from John for his maximum budget.  Accepting Alice's offer would mean spending more than his maximum, while rejecting and counter-offering might not yield a better result, and could risk running out of rounds. It's more prudent to secure the product at his desired price from John."
