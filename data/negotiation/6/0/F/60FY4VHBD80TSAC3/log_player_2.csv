"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special introductory price of $20,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $20,000 is way over his budget, so he'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than he's willing to pay. He'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not able to go that high.  How about $14,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been negotiating with Alice for a few rounds and it seems like they are not getting any closer to an agreement. He's already close to his budget limit with Alice's latest offer, and he has less than half of his rounds remaining. It's time to move on and go with the guaranteed $15,000 offer from John."
