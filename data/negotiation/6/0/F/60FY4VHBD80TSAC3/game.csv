"Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not able to go that high.  How about $14,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
