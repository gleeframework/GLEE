"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12500? That way, we both save some money and come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $13250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
