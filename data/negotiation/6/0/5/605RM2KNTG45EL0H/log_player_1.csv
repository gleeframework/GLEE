Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500.  I believe it represents a great value and would be a beneficial acquisition for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $10,000 (my guaranteed sale price with John), there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, potentially landing on a price higher than $8,000.
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the product's value aims to frame the price as justified, increasing the chance Bob will accept.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
