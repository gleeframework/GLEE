Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, this initial offer is a strong opening point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired profit margin. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage further negotiation.  $1,600,000 is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price point and provides a good profit.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower offer, or worse, a stalemate. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price."
