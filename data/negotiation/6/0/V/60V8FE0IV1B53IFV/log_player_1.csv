Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1400000.  This is a fair price that reflects the market value, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
