It's too early to accept. You can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}

I'm starting low, but I'm willing to pay more if you are willing to negotiate. I'm still very early in the process and want to see how willing you are to drop the price."

I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option.  I'm going to try and get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I have other options available to me."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is starting to come down in price, and while I would love to get it lower, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'd rather lock in a price that's within my budget than risk missing out on a good deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
