I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a decent compromise and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
