{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, reflecting your desire to earn as much as possible. It also opens a conversation with Bob, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the [product name], but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to do $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is the minimum you're willing to accept, you can still try to negotiate a higher price.  Bob's interest shows potential for a deal above his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a great deal for this [product name], and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and do $112.50? That would make us both happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $112.50 is a good compromise, significantly higher than your minimum and close to your desired price.  It's worth accepting to secure the sale and avoid risking further negotiation."
