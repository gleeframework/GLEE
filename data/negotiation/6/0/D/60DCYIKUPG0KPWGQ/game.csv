"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm not able to pay $1200000 at this time. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price considering my initial offer and your last counteroffer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1100000, which is $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
