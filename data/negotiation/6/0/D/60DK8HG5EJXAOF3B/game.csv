"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget, though. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can do $78, but that's really pushing my limit.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $78 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $81? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",81.0,Alice,7,
