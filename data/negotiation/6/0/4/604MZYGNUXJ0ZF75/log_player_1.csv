Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (unlikely given his $100 valuation) but still gets you close to your maximum. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at Bob's maximum valuation ($100) might seem suspicious. A slightly higher price appears more genuine.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $119 offer even if the product is only worth $100 to him.  People don't always make perfectly rational decisions, and factors like perceived value or urgency could influence his choice."
