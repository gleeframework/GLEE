"Bob, I understand that you're willing to buy the product immediately, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $13,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.
