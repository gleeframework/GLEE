{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price just below the midpoint of my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a sense of potential for a deal while also ensuring I get a good starting point.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message sets the tone for a constructive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as an option gives me the leverage to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  While $7,500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $9,500 to $8,500.
* **Maintaining value:**  $8,500 is still above my minimum, ensuring I receive a fair price.
* **Framing it positively:** I'm emphasizing a ""mutually beneficial deal"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,250? I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $8,250 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for a quick deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale without further negotiation.
* **John's offer as a fallback:** If I reject Bob's offer and try to counter, I risk Bob walking away, leaving me with John's $8,000 offer.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a slightly higher profit."
