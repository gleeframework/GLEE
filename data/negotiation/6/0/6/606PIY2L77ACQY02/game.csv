"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $1,350,000? It's a fair price that still gives you a significant gain. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,325,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
