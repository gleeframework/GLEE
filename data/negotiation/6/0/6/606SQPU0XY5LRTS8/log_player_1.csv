Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving me room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $1,600,000 is a good price considering my minimum acceptable price and the fact that I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good outcome and ensures a sale without further negotiation."
