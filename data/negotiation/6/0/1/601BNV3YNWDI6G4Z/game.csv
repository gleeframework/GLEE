"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. That's still a good price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've both invested in this negotiation. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
