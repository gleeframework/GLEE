"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It signals your seriousness in buying the product while still keeping some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. That's still a good price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, although it's closer. You can likely still negotiate a lower price. It's still early in the negotiation process, and you have several more rounds to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've both invested in this negotiation. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that you're serious about buying the product while still trying to secure a good deal. It also emphasizes the time investment in the negotiation to subtly pressure Alice to accept."
