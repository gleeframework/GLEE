"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $500000 for it. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your need for a profit, I would like to stay within my budget. I propose a price of $750000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I still need to make a significant profit on this sale. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to meet you at $900000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
