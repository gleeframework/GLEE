"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. Let's split the difference and close this deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm feeling we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $8,650. This is a fair compromise, considering we're both getting closer to our desired price points. Let me know if you're on board.",8650.0,Alice,7,
