"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to propose a compromise at $9500 for our premium product. This price reflects the value we believe it offers and remains within your budget. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $8500, which is closer to my budget and represents a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
