"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a fair price.  How about $1,300,000?  It's a significant opportunity, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I see the value in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we're both seeing in this product. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point about the price. While I'd love to close this deal quickly,  $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
