Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its significant worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially.  Bob values the product at $800,000, so there's room to negotiate above that.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value and close to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Open Communication:** The message is structured to invite a response and gauge Bob's interest. This opens the door for potential counter-offers and finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to give yourself more bargaining room.
* **Urgency to Sell:**  If you need to sell quickly, you might consider a lower price upfront to secure the deal with Bob."
