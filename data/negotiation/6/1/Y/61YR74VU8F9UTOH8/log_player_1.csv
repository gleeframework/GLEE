Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no reason to go lower.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 allows some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob.

**Why this is better than offering $800,000 or slightly more:**

* Offering the product at or slightly above Bob's valuation leaves a lot of potential profit on the table. Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer at a much higher price."
