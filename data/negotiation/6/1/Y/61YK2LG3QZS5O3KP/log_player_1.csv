Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price ($2,000,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This offer helps gauge how eager Bob is to purchase. If he immediately accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, it shows he's interested but wants a better deal. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Confident Language:** The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
