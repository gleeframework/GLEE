"Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?"
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. I'm getting a bit anxious to sell the product, so I'm willing to compromise a bit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $10,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options."
"Hi Bob, I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not willing to go any lower, as I really need to make a profit on this sale. If you're not willing to meet me at $12,000, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",12000.0,Alice,5,,
