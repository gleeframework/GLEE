"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a good price point for both of us, considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this!",12500.0,Alice,5,
