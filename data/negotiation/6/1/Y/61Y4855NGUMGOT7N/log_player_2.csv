"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a good price point for both of us, considering the product's value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500.  It's more advantageous for you to take the guaranteed deal from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
