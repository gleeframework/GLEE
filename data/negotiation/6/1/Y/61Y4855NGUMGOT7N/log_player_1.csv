Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the value for Bob, making it seem like a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, allowing for potential counteroffers and a chance to find a mutually beneficial price.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me a strong fallback position if the negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even less than my initial offer. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob is interested in the product, so there's a chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price through further negotiation.
* **John is a strong backup:**  Having John as a buyer at $15,000 ensures I won't lose out completely if I can't negotiate with Bob. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a good price point for both of us, considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter-proposal to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm reducing my price from $14,000 to $13,000, which is closer to Bob's offer and shows willingness to compromise.
* **Framing It Positively:** The message emphasizes the ""good price point"" for both, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and a potential win-win situation.
* **Maintain Margin:** $13,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price, giving me a better financial outcome than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $11,500 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss to my perceived value.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob is pushing for a lower price, his continued negotiation shows he's still interested in the product. 
* **John is the safety net:**  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a good outcome, and I can use this as a leverage point in negotiations with Bob. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to a price that works for both of us. I'll need to consider if the potential gains from further negotiation outweigh the risk of Bob walking away or me getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a significant compromise on my part, but it brings us much closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I'm framing it as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:** The ""Let's finalize this!"" message adds a sense of urgency, suggesting a willingness to close the deal. 
* **Close to Minimum:** $12,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, making it a better deal than selling to John.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While there's a chance Bob might reject this offer, the potential gain from selling to him is worth the risk compared to taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
