Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which is close to my ideal outcome but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** The message highlights the product's value and potential for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates I'm open to discussing the price, inviting Bob to engage in a negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've successfully sold the product at a good price.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. I will consider the price, John's offer of $1,000,000, and the likelihood of securing a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my desired outcome and even below John's offer. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is lower, he's willing to negotiate. This suggests there's still room for a compromise.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks losing him as a buyer. However, accepting his offer would mean a significantly lower profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial $1,400,000. I'll need to be strategic and consider how much I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is tempting, it doesn't quite reflect the product's full value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting a fair compromise.  This price allows you to secure a valuable asset at a price that's still beneficial to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value again to remind Bob of its worth and justify the price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Potential for Acceptance:** $1,300,000 is still a good profit for me and may be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a good price for the product.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. I will carefully consider the price, John's offer of $1,000,000, and the likelihood of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** While $1,250,000 is still below my ideal outcome, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  Rejecting Bob's offer again risks losing him as a buyer, and there's no guarantee I can get a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **John's offer:**  Accepting this offer is still considerably better than selling to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalization:**  I will finalize the sale with Bob at $1,250,000, securing a profit that's closer to my desired outcome."
