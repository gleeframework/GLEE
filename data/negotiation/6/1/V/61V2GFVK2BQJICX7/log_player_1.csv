Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Motivating message:**  I'm trying to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and encourage him to accept.
* **Backup plan:**  Remember, I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with.
* **I have leverage with John:**  I can easily walk away from Bob and get my desired price from John. This gives me the upper hand in negotiations.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I can likely get a higher price than $9,000 from Bob, as he has expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm presenting this as a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Focus on benefits:**  I'm highlighting the fairness of the price and the possibility of closing the deal. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think $9,000 is the highest I can go. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob is firm on $9,000, which is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which ensures I'll get the best possible price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a higher price, and I don't want to waste time.

It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk losing time and potentially ending up with a much lower price from Bob."
