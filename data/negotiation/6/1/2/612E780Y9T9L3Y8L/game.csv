"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling price.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $1,700,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
