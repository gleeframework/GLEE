Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
