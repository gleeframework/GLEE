# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product.

While Alice is coming down in price,  $1,800,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
