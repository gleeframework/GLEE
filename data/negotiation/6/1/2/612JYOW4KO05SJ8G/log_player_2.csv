Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is way over his budget of $120. He should counteroffer and see if he can get a better price."

While $160 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his limit. He should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $155 is very close to Bob's budget, he can still save money by making another counteroffer. He's shown he's willing to negotiate and Alice has lowered her price each round. It's worth trying one more time to see if he can reach a mutually acceptable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob has made several counteroffers and Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but she's still not willing to go below $150.  While $152 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit and further negotiation could take a lot of time.  John is offering the product for $120, which is within Bob's budget.  He should go with the safe option and buy from John."
