"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you can work with.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000, but I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1,180,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1180000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,180,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering your stated value for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. However, I was thinking that we could do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on this, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. I believe this price is fair, considering your stated value, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
