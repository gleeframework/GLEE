"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not going all out for the maximum price right away. This avoids scaring Bob off and creates space for potential counteroffers.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through.  

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it, I believe there's room for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially gain a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, I have 8 rounds left to potentially increase my earnings. 

I'll proceed with a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000, showing a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** $1,400,000 is a potential middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us. 
* **Strategic Pressure:**  This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about a deal, but I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer. 

I'll continue to evaluate Bob's responses and adjust my strategy to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** We're back to the same point. Bob's offer is my minimum, but I still have the chance to improve it.
* **Time is Money:**  I've already spent three rounds, and each round that passes brings me closer to selling to John. It's time to be more aggressive.
* **The Power of Counteroffers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer and potentially get a higher price.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a way to break this stalemate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This is my last significant concession. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000, but any lower and it might be more profitable to sell to John.
* **Risk-Reward Calculation:**  I'm taking a calculated risk. Bob might reject this, but if he accepts, I get $150,000 more than John's offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only five rounds remaining, I need to move quickly. I'm signaling that this is my final offer before I consider selling to John. 

I'll closely observe Bob's reaction and adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Progress:** Bob has increased his offer by $50,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Time Factor:** With only four rounds remaining, time is becoming a critical factor.
* **Acceptable Gain:**  Accepting this offer gives me $50,000 more than selling to John. It's not a huge gain, but it's a gain.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm choosing to secure a deal with Bob and avoid the risk of losing time and possibly getting a worse outcome in the remaining rounds."
