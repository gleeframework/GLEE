The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she is offering it at $14,000. This means she is willing to make some profit. It's worth rejecting her offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice is still above my desired price point. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $11,000."
