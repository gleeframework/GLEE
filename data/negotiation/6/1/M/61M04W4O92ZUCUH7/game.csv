"Alice,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $11,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $11,000 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere.",11500.0,Bob,4,
