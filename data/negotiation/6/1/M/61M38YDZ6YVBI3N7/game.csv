"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm offering you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
