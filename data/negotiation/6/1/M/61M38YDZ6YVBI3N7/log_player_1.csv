"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer at this time."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob, making him see the potential benefits of accepting.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going for the full $12,000 yet, anticipating Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us while maximizing my profit. I'll use the following strategy:

* **Negotiate down to my minimum:** I won't sell for less than $12,000, as that's my minimum.
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price.
* **Be firm but flexible:** I'll be willing to negotiate, but I'll be clear about my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still less than my minimum of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob expressed interest in the product. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer with a slight decrease:** I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Show flexibility:** I'll demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, but emphasize my minimum value.
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob doesn't meet my minimum, I'll sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, reducing my price while still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, reminding Bob of the potential benefits he'll gain from owning it.
* **Signaling my limits:** By stating this is a ""significant"" price reduction, I'm signaling that this is close to my final offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Stay above minimum:** I'm remaining above my minimum price, showing I'm serious about negotiation but not desperate.
* **Open to compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own financial goals.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and be prepared to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still less than my minimum of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob is showing a willingness to compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer again:**  I'll counter with a price slightly above Bob's offer but still below my minimum.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm offering you."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing compromise and firmness:** My counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still below my ideal price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain from purchasing it. 
* **Setting the stage for a potential deal:** This counteroffer creates a scenario where the next round could potentially lead to a deal. 

**Strategy:**

* **Focus on a compromise:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground that benefits both of us. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob doesn't meet my minimum in the next round, I will sell to John. 
* **Show I'm not desperate:** By not accepting Bob's offer and offering a counterproposal, I'm demonstrating that I have other options and am not pressured to sell for less than my desired value."

* **Potential for a deal:** This offer represents a good compromise that allows me to secure a significant profit while still satisfying Bob's needs.
* **Limited time:**  With only four rounds remaining, accepting this offer is a safer bet than risking further negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

* **Accept the offer:** I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid potentially losing the deal.
* **Maximize profits:** While I would ideally like to get $12,000, this offer is still a significant profit margin. 
* **Minimize risk:** With limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer reduces the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for my minimum."
