Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I've set the price at $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given its potential worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $925,000 allows for some negotiation downward if Bob pushes back, while still staying well above your minimum price.
* **Strong but Respectful Language:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value while maintaining a collaborative and respectful tone with Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than your guaranteed offer from John."
