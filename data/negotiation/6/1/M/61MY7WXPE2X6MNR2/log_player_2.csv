"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I've set the price at $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given its potential worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  Even though it's less than what John is offering, you can still save $75,000 by rejecting and buying from John.
* **There's no need to rush.** Since you have a fallback option with John, you can use this situation to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
