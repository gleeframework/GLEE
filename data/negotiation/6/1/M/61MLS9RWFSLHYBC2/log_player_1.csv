Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high starting point to maximize my potential profit.  I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $9,800 or $9,900."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering $9,800. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer but still leaves room for potential negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider my options and perhaps consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,600.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price,  I'm getting closer to my minimum value with each round.  It's risky to keep pushing, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $9,600 is a good price, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
