"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. How about we discuss a price of $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we try to find a middle ground at $80?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and come down from $180 to $120, and now you're asking me to go down to $80. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can we discuss a price of $110?",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  It seems like we both value this product, but we're still a bit apart. I can budge a little, how about $90?",90.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go down to $105, but that's as low as I can go. Can we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,7,
