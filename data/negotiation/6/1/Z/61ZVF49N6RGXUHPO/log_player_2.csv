"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. I've carefully assessed its value, and given its potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price in subsequent rounds."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $887,500.  This represents a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here.  How about we settle this right now at $900,000? This provides you a great deal on a valuable product, and allows me to ensure a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's a good deal compared to both John's offer and the earlier rounds of negotiation.  Accepting this offer secures a valuable product at a reasonable price."
