"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  You know John will sell it to you for $12,000, so you have a fallback option. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
