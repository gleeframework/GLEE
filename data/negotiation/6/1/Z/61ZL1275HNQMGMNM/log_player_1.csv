"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $14,000 offer allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm aiming to build rapport with Bob and create a sense of opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to counter:** I have 10 rounds, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While $15,000 is my ideal, I can still secure a profitable sale by selling to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** By offering $12,500, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  The message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes the win-win nature of the potential deal.
* **Positive and persuasive:** The tone remains friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we settle at $11,000? That would be a comfortable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $11,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have several rounds left, and I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** Although I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, selling to John for $15,000 remains a viable backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive and persuasive:** I'm using a positive tone and framing the offer as a win-win situation."
