"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we settle at $11,000? That would be a comfortable price for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
