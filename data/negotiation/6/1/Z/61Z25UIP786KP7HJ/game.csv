"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $130? It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $115? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can come to an agreement at this price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we try $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,5,
