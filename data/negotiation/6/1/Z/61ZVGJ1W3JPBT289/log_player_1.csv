Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000, which is slightly above Bob's valuation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum valuation of $10,000. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum valuation, and it shows a willingness to negotiate. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum valuation. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's ultimately a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John for the same price would be a waste of time."
