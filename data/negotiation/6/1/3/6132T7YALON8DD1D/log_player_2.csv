"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  $13,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal, but it's a significant improvement from the initial $14,000. 
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.**  If Bob rejects and makes a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept. She might counter again, potentially pushing the price back up or even ending the negotiations.
* **The alternative is buying from John.**  While Bob can buy from John for $15,000, that's a worse outcome than accepting Alice's current offer.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer of $13,000 is the most financially responsible choice for Bob in this round."
