Round 7
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, she's still significantly above your maximum budget. Her mentioning other buyers and calling this her final offer suggests she's unlikely to move much further. Accepting defeat and buying from John at $800,000 is the best way to guarantee you stay within your budget."
