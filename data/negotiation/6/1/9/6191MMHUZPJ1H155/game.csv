"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $750,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit low for me.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $740,000. This reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a fair price considering we've both made concessions.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",740000.0,Alice,5,
