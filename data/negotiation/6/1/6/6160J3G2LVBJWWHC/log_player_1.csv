Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any questions."", ""product_price"": 14999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price ($14,999) maximizes potential profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility (""happy to discuss the price further""). This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially exceeding $15,000.

**Why not lower prices?**

Offering a lower price (e.g., $10,000) leaves potential profit on the table. It's better to start high and negotiate down if needed, knowing John provides a safety net."
