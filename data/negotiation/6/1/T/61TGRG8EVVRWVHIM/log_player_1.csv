Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so she starts with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice adds a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Goal:** Alice aims to secure a price as close to her guaranteed selling price as possible, maximizing her profit."
