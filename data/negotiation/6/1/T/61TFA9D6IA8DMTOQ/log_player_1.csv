Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can work something out.
