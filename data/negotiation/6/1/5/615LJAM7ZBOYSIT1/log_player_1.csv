Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the middle ground approach. However, I still cannot exceed $15,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

While I could push Bob further, it's unlikely he'll go above $15,000. Accepting his offer secures the sale at the same price John is offering, avoiding further negotiation and potential loss."
