"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll pay $78 for the product. What do you think?",78.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go below $80. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about I meet you at $79? It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll really like it.",79.0,Alice,5,
