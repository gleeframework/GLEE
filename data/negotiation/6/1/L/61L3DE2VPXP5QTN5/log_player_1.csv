Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While $2,300,000 represents the high value I place on this product, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Would you consider $1,850,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but that's still quite a gap from what I had in mind.  To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  If you're able to work within that range, I'm very interested.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now revealed that his maximum willingness to pay is $1,000,000.  Continuing negotiations with him will likely result in a final price close to his offer, which is significantly less than what John is offering. Accepting John's offer ensures the highest possible profit for Alice."
