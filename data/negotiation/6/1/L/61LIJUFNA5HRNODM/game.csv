,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, and I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  But $135 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $138, which is closer to your offer and still within my acceptable range. Let's see if we can close this deal.",138.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $138 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $138, which would be $136.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",136.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair. $136.50 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $137? I believe that's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",137.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable with $137. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $137, which would be $136. Would you be willing to accept that price?",136.0,Bob,8,
