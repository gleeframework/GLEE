"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. This is the highest I can go at this time, given its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  While $12,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price, but only if you can finalize the purchase within the next 24 hours. This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal with you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
