"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the product for much less from John.  While Alice believes it's a good deal, it doesn't align with your valuation."
