"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is attractive, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows for a counteroffer to potentially lower the price further and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Would you be willing to consider $700,000? "", ""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still above her minimum value.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good compromise. It's within my acceptable range, and I'm comfortable with the deal.  Moving forward with John would cost significantly more, so accepting Alice's offer is the most financially responsible choice."
