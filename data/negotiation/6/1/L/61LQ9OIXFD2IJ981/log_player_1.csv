Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $120 = $30) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150 - $140 = $10). This strategy aims to maximize your profit while increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. 

By starting with a strong offer close to Bob's maximum valuation, you increase the chances of a quick and profitable sale."
