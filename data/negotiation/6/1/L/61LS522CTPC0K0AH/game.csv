"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I would still like to keep my budget as tight as possible. Would it be possible to reach a compromise at $8,500? Thank you for considering my request.",8500.0,Bob,4,
