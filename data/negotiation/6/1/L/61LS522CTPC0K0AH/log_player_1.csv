"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I want for the product.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer and see where we can go from there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I would still like to keep my budget as tight as possible. Would it be possible to reach a compromise at $8,500? Thank you for considering my request. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to my target, I'm going to stick with my minimum value. I'm confident that I can get my full asking price of $12,000 from John, so I'll go with that option."
