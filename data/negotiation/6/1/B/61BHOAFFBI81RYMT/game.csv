"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the product's unique qualities and potential warrant a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
