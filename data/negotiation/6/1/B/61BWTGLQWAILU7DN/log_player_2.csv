"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but he shouldn't overpay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $18,000 is significantly closer to its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's a significant drop from $18,000, $15,000 is still far beyond his budget. He can get the same product from John for $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but he shouldn't overpay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price, considering what I can get the product for elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I value your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but he shouldn't overpay. He can likely get Alice to drop her price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
