"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $90 is just too far below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference at $105? Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $100? That's the most I can do.  Let's make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
