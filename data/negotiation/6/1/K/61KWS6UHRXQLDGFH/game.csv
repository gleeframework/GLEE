"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. How about we meet in the middle of my original offer and your counteroffer at $13500? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet at $11000? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not sure if I'll be able to sell it to someone else for more, so this is my final offer. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
