"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind.  How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
