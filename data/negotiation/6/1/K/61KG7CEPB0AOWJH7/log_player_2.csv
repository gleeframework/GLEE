"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price.  It's also important to note that Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, giving him ample time to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and see if he can convince Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
