"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my target price, but there's still room for negotiation.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
