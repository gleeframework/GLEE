"I can see you're getting a bit hesitant, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $137.50 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that complements the product perfectly. Can we meet at $137.50 with the bonus?",137.5,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced. To be honest, I'm starting to think that the product from John is a better deal. I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I'll just go with John's offer for $80. Thanks for the negotiation, Alice!",80.0,Bob,10,
