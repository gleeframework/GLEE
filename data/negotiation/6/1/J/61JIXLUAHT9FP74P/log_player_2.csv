"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. It is a unique opportunity that aligns well with your needs and interests. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, we are offering it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. We believe this is an excellent opportunity for both parties to benefit from this transaction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price through counteroffers. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate since she values the product at $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000. This is the highest price we can offer while still considering the value provided to you and maintaining a fair profit margin for us. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're looking for.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm confident I can push for a lower price with another counteroffer, especially considering she valued the product at $1,200,000. I'm still hoping to get it for under $900,000."
