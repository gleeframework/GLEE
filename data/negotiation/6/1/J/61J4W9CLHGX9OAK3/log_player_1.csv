Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you decide to lower the price later.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours and John's. By starting high, you can gauge Bob's interest. If he's immediately turned off, you haven't lost anything.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. This means you don't have to settle for anything less than that amount.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, you maximize your profit.
* **Bob Counters:** This opens up negotiation. You can decide if you want to lower the price, potentially settling somewhere between his valuation and yours. 
* **Bob Rejects:** You can always go back to John and sell it for your minimum acceptable price."
