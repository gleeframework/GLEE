"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. My asking price is $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be interested, as it's still lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $105. Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $100. While I'd prefer more, it's a good price considering the value to Bob and the fact that I have limited rounds left.  It's also significantly higher than selling to John."
