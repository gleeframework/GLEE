"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have a lower price point in mind and could potentially negotiate a better price with Alice.
* **No pressure to accept:** Buying from John for $1,000,000 is an option, but it's not your ideal outcome. 

By rejecting the offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, $900,000 is still significantly above your ideal price point. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:**  Alice is willing to negotiate, and you have a clear understanding of her bottom line.
* **Avoiding unnecessary cost:**  Buying from John at $1,000,000 is a last resort, and there's still potential to save more with Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price, potentially closer to your $850,000 counteroffer."
