"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I could see myself going to $700,000.  Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
