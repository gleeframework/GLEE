"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  It helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
