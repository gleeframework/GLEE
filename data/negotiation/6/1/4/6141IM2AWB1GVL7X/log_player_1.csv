I'm starting with a high price, but still lower than my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate a bit, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop so significantly below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll meet me in the middle."

Bob's offer is still too low.  Even though it's getting closer, I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm going to sell to John and avoid any further negotiation."
