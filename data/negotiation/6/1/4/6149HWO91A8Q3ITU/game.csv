"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply not enough. How about we split the difference? I'll let you have it for $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's be realistic here. I've come down from my initial price, and you've only gone up a few dollars.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can close this deal. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $100 is a good offer.  Let's split the difference,  I'll take $105 for it. That's a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a close.  How does that sound?",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very close to my limit, but I can offer $102. If you want to close this deal, I think we should meet in the middle.",102.0,Bob,8,
