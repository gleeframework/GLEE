{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive and enthusiastic:** My message is positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Reasonable price:** While $175 is above Bob's valuation, it's still within a reasonable range considering the product is worth at least $150 to me. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer if he wants.

I'm aiming to get the highest price possible, but I'm also mindful of not scaring Bob away with an unrealistic offer. I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see what Bob's willing to pay first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. Even though I might be able to sell to John for $150, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground and strike a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($80). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm understanding of the product's value.
* **Positive and encouraging:** My message is still positive and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still open to negotiation, giving Bob a chance to counteroffer again if he wants. 

By offering a reasonable compromise, I aim to move the negotiation closer to my desired outcome while still keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could counteroffer again, it's unlikely he'll budge further.  I'm confident that selling to John for $150 is the best option at this point. This guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
