I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a significant price that reflects the value of the product to me. I want to get as much as possible, but I also want to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price to $11,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm countering with $12,500. This is a compromise that still gets me closer to my desired price, but also shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a price we both agree on. I'd rather sell to John and get my desired price of $15,000."
