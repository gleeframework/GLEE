"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget. Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a clear lower limit for you, as you're prepared to walk away and buy from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get the price down further, as you can always walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, dropping her price from $14,000 to $12,500. This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway while staying within your budget constraints. It leaves some room for further negotiation, but if Alice rejects it, you can still buy from John for $10,000."
