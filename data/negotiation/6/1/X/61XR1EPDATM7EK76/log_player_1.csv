Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and that I'm offering it to him before listing it publicly, I'm subtly implying the price could go even higher.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message is friendly and ends with a question, indicating I'm open to discussing the price further if Bob counters.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can then gradually lower the price, aiming to stay above my minimum of $8,000."
