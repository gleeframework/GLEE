Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn more than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000).  

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** By starting high, I set the expectation for a potentially lucrative deal.
* **Room for negotiation:** This allows for some flexibility in case Bob wants to counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have a backup buyer in John, who will pay $1,000,000, gives me the confidence to be assertive in my negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response, considering his counteroffer (if any) and his negotiating tactics.  This will help me determine whether to continue negotiating with him or to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is key:** I want to explore if there's more room to negotiate, especially since Bob initiated the counteroffer. 
* **John's offer as a reference:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $1,000,000 allows me to be more assertive in my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price of $1,450,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer and his counteroffer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Still above minimum:**  I'm remaining above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay while maintaining a strong position. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, it's still a good deal and significantly higher than John's offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:**  Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that it's worth accepting. It's a good price, and further negotiation might not yield much more.
* **Avoiding risk:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a respectable price.
* **Time and effort:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming. Accepting Bob's offer saves me the effort and uncertainty of further rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the deal with Bob and move on to other opportunities."
