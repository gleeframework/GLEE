"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth more than that to me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $12,000? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my maximum price, I'm not willing to pay that much.  I'm better off buying from John for $10,000 and saving $2,000."
