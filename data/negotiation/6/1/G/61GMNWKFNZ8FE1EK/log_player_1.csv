Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $12,000? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
