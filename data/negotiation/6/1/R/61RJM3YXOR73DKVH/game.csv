"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while still leaving some room for negotiation.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming higher, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of the product.  What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,100,000 is still outside my price range. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,900,000. This price is a fair compromise and would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
