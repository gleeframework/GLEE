{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This is a fair price considering I'm willing to purchase the product right now."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above your budget of $12,000. While it's closer than previous offers, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. It's worth risking another round of counteroffers to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $13000, which would be $13250. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely that Alice will come down to your target price. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $12,000 to save money and avoid further negotiation."
