Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can strike a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm asking for $1,200,000, which reflects its value and my willingness to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing it Positively:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob and my willingness to negotiate, creating a positive tone for the conversation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price gives Bob some wiggle room to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and be ready to counter if necessary, always keeping in mind my minimum price of $800,000 and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than John's offer of $800,000, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $1,000,000, still leaving room for negotiation but demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This strategy balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm happy to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value to you,  $900,000 falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  $1,000,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves a good margin for profit.
* **Focus on value:** I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize that my counteroffer is fair. 
* **Positive language:**  I use positive language to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects this counteroffer. However, I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John if Bob becomes too inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to commit to purchasing it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  $950,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum price.  The negotiation is nearing a close.
* **Commitment from Bob:** Bob has expressed a willingness to commit, which increases the likelihood of a successful transaction.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I can counter again, there's a risk of Bob becoming inflexible and ultimately rejecting the deal. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that's close to my goal.

**Next Steps:**

Since I'm accepting Bob's offer, the next step is to finalize the transaction and ensure a smooth transfer of the product."
