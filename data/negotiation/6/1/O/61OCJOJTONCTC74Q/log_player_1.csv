{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being above my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Would you be open to $80? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$80 is way too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm willing to be flexible but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a fair price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a good compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $100?  That's still a good price for me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, I've already spent several rounds negotiating and am not confident that Bob will go higher. It's better to sell to John now and guarantee a price that meets my minimum requirement."
