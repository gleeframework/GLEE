"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Would you be open to $80? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm willing to be flexible but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a fair price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a good compromise.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $100?  That's still a good price for me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,
