# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  Alice's offer of $120 is lower than buying from John for $150.
* **It's still within your budget:** You are willing to spend up to $150, so $120 is within your price range."
