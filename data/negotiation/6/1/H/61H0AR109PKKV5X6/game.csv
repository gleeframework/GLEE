"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8000 is definitely below what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is getting close to my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
