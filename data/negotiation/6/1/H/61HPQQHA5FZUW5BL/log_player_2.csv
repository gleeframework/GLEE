Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. It's still a great price for a product that's worth $120 to you. What do you say?

Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, I know I can get it for $120 from John. I'll try to meet in the middle with my next counteroffer."
