Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still thinking $10,000 is a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle from $12,500 to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firmly rooted at $10,000 and is unlikely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
