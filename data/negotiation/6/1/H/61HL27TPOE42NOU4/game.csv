"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, your starting price is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This represents a significant discount and would allow us to close the deal quickly. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to save some money while also acknowledging the product's worth. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and the fact that we're both willing to make some concessions. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're committed to your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This represents a good compromise for both of us.  If we can agree on this price, we can finalize the deal. Let's not let this opportunity pass us by.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
