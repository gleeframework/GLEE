Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start with my desired price of $12,000. Since Bob is willing to pay $10,000, there's room for negotiation, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay closer to my value. If he rejects, I'll have to consider how much I'm willing to lower the price to get a deal.  I can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I am not willing to accept such a low price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value of $12,000. Although it's closer, I am still not willing to accept such a low price. I will make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get a price that is more than my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price considering the value of the product to him and to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is finally at my minimum value, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if he will continue to increase his offer.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick sale, I will sell the product to John for $12,000."
