"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm giving him room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more. I'll reject and try to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. It's $500 more than my minimum and I'm getting closer to my desired price.  With limited rounds left, I'd rather secure the deal than risk losing to John."
