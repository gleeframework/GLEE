I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still above my minimum value of $15,000 and is a more reasonable price point compared to my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a compromise that will satisfy both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell at that price yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is just above my minimum value and I believe it's a fair price considering the back and forth we've had. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the sale."
