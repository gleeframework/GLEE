"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but I need it to be a bit more cost-effective for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I have to be mindful of the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's already below my initial asking price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
