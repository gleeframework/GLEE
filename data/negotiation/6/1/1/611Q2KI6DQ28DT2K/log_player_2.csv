Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I have to be mindful of the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's already below my initial asking price. What do you think?
