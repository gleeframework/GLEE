Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth. What do you think?

I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering you a price of $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. What do you think?
