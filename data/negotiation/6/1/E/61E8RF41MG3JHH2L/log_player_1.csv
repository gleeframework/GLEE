"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see what counteroffer he makes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves me with a profit. I believe that Bob might be willing to pay this price, especially since it's closer to his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent amount, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a good profit. I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot and Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiations are getting tough. Bob's offer is dropping below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that I'm going to end up with a lower profit than expected.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from Bob."
