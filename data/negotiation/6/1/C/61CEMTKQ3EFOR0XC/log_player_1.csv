Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,000 at this point.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $14,000, but I can't go any lower. It's a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,000?  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm very close to my budget, but I believe $13,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. This would be my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob is getting closer to my minimum but I'm running out of time. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a higher profit and less risk of a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
