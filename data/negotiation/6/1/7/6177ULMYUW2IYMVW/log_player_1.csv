``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but not too high to scare Bob off.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130?  It's still a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  I'm going to accept his offer of $120.  It's better than selling to John for $150, and it seems like Bob is ready to close the deal."
