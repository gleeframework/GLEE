"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent amount, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I hope this will be enough to entice Bob without completely shutting down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering $650,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum threshold. I've been through several rounds of negotiations and I'm not convinced he'll go any higher. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000, which is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum price requirement."
