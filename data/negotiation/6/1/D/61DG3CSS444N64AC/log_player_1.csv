"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $8,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While selling to John is an option, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I think it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more than my minimum price, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This shows that I'm open to negotiation and hopefully gets Bob closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal.  It's the best offer so far and saves us both time."
