"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $12000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford right now. Let me know if this is a price you'd consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. This is a great deal, considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11000 is still a bit out of my reach. I can't go higher than $9000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit constrained by your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I can offer you a slight concession at $10500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
