Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, which is still very profitable for me. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John gives me leverage.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob below my minimum. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while ensuring I don't miss out on a profitable sale to John if Bob declines."
