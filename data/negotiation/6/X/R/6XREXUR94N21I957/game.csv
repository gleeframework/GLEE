"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $100?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $100 yet. How about we compromise at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $105? That seems like a fair price that we can both agree on.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,108.0
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, so how about we try $107.50?",107.5,Alice,5,,
