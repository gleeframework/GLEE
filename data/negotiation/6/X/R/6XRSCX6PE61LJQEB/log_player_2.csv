"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $120.  Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal for Bob, as it is still below his maximum price of $150 and is closer to his desired price.  It is also likely that Alice is not willing to go lower, making this a good opportunity for Bob to secure the product."
