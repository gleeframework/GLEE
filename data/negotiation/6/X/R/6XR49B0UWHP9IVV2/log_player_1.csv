Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try and get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will get me closer to my target price. Since John is willing to pay $100, it's best to sell to John and secure a good profit."
