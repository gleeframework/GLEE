"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount due to its unique features and benefits. I'm initially offering it to you for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I can consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $7,500 is closer, but still undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $9,500. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on a price that's above your maximum budget. Her latest offer of $9,500 is getting close, but it's still a gamble to try and negotiate further, especially since she claims to have other buyers. You have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, which is a better use of your budget."
