"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount due to its unique features and benefits. I'm initially offering it to you for $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I can consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $7,500 is closer, but still undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $9,500. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",9500.0,Alice,5,
