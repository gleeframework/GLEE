"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $140. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product provides.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $75?  I think that's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $115? This is already quite a reduction.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $115 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  How about $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
