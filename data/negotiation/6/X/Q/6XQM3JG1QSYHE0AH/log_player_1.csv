Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $14,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $14,000 is below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him a potential bargain. 

This strategy aims to get Bob to accept quickly, but leaves room for negotiation if he wants a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $12,000, I can do better.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to accept a price too far below my initial offer.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** It demonstrates flexibility and signals I'm serious about selling to Bob. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my desired price than his previous offers, and it's still above the $12,000 I could get from John. I'll accept this offer to close the deal."
