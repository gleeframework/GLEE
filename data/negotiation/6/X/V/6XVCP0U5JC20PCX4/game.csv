"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $12,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12875.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,050. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
