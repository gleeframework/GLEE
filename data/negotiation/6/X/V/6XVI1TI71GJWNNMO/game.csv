"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1250000, which is $1175000. This is my best offer for now, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
