"While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product and believe it has great potential, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $975,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product holds significant value, and I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This shows my strong interest and commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
