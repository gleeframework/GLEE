"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your budget.  It's better to reject and start negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product and believe it has great potential, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $975,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your target.  Rejecting and counter-offering again allows for further negotiation and potentially a better deal. There's also still some room to negotiate before needing to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product holds significant value, and I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This shows my strong interest and commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. This is my last concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is very close to your maximum budget of $800,000.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you might have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price, and you've saved $125,000 compared to buying from John."
