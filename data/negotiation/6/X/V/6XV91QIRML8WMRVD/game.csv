"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm open to finding common ground,  $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,225,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
