,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,500,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the unique features and long-term value this product offers, which I believe you'll find highly beneficial.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually acceptable solution.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
