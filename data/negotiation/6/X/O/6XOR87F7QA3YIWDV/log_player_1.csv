"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. We're still significantly below his perceived value of $1,200,000, leaving room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To show my good faith, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle on $1,080,000? I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,080,000 is the best price for this product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,030,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is still engaging in negotiation, his counter-offers are getting smaller. He increased his offer by $50,000 between rounds 2 and 4, then only by $30,000 between rounds 4 and 6. This could indicate he's reaching his upper limit. We're still significantly above our minimum, so it's worth pushing a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that. Let's find a point we can both agree on. How about splitting the difference - $1,055,000? This ensures we both walk away feeling good about the transaction."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,020,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly hesitant to go higher, as his increases are becoming smaller. Accepting $1,020,000 secures a significant profit above our $1,000,000 minimum and avoids the risk of Bob dropping out in later rounds.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the opportunity."
