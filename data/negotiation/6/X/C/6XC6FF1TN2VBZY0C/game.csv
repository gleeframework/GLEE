"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $750,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
