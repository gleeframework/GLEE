Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I do see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
