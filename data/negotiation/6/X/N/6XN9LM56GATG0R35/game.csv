"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth more than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price that gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go up to $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
