Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, getting Bob to buy it for anything above our minimum ($150) means more profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high but below John's offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down a bit (if he's inclined), potentially landing on a price higher than the $150 fallback.
* **Perceived Value:**  Offering a price slightly below John's purchase price might make Bob perceive the offer as a better deal."
