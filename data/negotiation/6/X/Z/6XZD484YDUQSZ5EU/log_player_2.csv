"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still a significant amount of money.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she knows you have another option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my desired selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $800,000. This price is within my budget and saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
