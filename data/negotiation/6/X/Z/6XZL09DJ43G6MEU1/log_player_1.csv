Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm also factoring in that I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above John's offer.  It shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better price with another round of negotiation.  At this point, selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a good profit and avoids further uncertainty."
