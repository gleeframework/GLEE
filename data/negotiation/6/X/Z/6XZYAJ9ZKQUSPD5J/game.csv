"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, Bob. I'll sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. If you accept, you'll be getting an amazing deal. If not, I have another interested buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,500,000. The choice is yours.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
