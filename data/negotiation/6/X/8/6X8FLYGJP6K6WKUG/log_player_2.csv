"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000), but still leaves significant room for negotiation. As Bob, you want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Considering the value to both of us, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me. Considering the significant value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above the product's value to her ($800,000). Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to $950,000. There's still room for compromise, and rejecting Alice's offer allows him to make another counteroffer."
