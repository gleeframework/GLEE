"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value, but still well above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary, while also showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $12,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
