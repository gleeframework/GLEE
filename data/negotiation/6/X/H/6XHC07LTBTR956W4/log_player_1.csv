Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's important to remember that I'm Alice, and I want to maximize my profit. However, I also need to be strategic. This initial offer is a good place to start the negotiation, but I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response.  

Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Fairness:** Starting with a fair price establishes a good negotiation foundation.
* **Maximizing potential:** $1,000,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, so this leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Time pressure:** I'm not explicitly mentioning John, but the possibility of selling to another buyer creates some pressure on Bob to make a decision. 

I'll be ready to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While I'm open to negotiation, $750,000 is too far off from my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects a significant discount and allows us both to find common ground. Let's continue this discussion to find a solution we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

Here's why I chose this counteroffer:

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not by a drastic amount.
* **Maintain Value:**  $900,000 still represents a considerable value for me. I'm not giving away the product for a significant loss.
* **Urgency:** By offering a reasonable compromise, I'm putting pressure on Bob to reconsider and potentially accept this offer.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price. However, I'm prepared to adjust my strategy further based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still too low for me. I'm not ready to give up that much value yet.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate, but $800,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers. This shows a commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Fairness:**  $850,000 still reflects a substantial value for me, but it's a price that Bob might be more willing to accept.
* **Final Push:** By offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, I'm hoping to encourage him to accept and finalize the deal.

This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I will proceed to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
