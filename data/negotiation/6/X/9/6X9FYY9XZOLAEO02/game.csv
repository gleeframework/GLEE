"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $115? It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you at $125. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
