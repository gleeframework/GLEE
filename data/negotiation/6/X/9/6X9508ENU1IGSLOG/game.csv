"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product, which is fair considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $165. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $150. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
