"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, so there's no room for negotiation.  Since you can buy the product from John for the same price, it's logical to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This strategy doesn't guarantee you'll save money, but it avoids potentially paying more if Alice was hoping to get closer to your maximum."
