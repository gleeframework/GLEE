"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14000. This still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a good price.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. This is the best I can do, but I'm really interested in making a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13500.0,Bob,4,
