"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $15000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $17500. This is still a fair price for the product, and I believe it's a good value for you. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $16250?  That's a fair price for both of us.",16250.0,Bob,4,
