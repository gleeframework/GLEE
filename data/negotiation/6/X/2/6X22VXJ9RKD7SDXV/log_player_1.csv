Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a figure above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While not overly detailed, mentioning ""value"" subtly implies there are reasons for the price, potentially piquing Bob's interest.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrases like ""proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" invite Bob into a dialogue rather than presenting a non-negotiable ultimatum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your minimum ($15,000) and you have a backup buyer (John), which puts you in a strong position."
