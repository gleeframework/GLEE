{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still below what Bob is willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, giving me some leverage in case Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'd like to get, but it's still above my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,500 is a good price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

This counteroffer is still above my minimum, but it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping that he'll see the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum. I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product for $12,000.  It's a good deal for both of us.  While I could potentially get a higher price with more negotiation, it's not worth the time and effort."
