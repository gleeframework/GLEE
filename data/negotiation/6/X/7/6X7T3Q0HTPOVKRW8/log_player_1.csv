Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob or potentially sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I have 6 more rounds, so I'm going to keep negotiating. If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $950,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
