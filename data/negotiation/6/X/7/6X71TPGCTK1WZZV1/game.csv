"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $675,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $675,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $660,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a decent deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",660000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm seeing some progress here.  $670,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I still need to be a bit more mindful of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $665,000.  This feels like a solid compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",665000.0,Bob,6,
