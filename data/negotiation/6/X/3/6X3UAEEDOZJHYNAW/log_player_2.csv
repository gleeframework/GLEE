Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12,500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $12,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $12,800 is just $300 more than Bob's target price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer while still leaving some room for a decent deal.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to pay John's higher price."
