"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really benefit from it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from the product at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $7,500 is closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $7,000. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000? That would be a great price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,800. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. While I could try to haggle further, $7,800 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's $8,000 offer. It's better to accept a slightly lower savings than risk losing the deal entirely."
