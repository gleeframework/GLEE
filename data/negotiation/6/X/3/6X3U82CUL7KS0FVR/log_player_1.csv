Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's something that could be very beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to haggle, but still ensures Alice a significant profit.
* **Alternative in Mind:** Alice has a safety net with John's offer ($10,000), so she can afford to aim high with Bob.

**Important:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,500. He might try to negotiate a lower price or walk away altogether. Alice needs to be prepared to assess his responses and potentially adjust her strategy."
