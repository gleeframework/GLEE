Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression the product might be worth more than Bob initially thought. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This high initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, I know I need to significantly lower the price. If he counters, it opens up the negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm not overly concerned about scaring Bob off with a high price. Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage and a safety net."
