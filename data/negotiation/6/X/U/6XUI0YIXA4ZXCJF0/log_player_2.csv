"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe we can come to an agreement. I am offering it to you for $140. This is a special offer considering the value it holds for you. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the perceived value to you ($150) while knowing her own valuation is lower ($120). 
* While $140 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price by negotiating or considering John's offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're not easily swayed and open the door for a counter-offer closer to her actual valuation. Even if she doesn't budge much, you can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
