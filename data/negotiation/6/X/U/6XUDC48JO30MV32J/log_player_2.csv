"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $90, which is still above Bob's maximum value of $100.
* **Better Option:**  Bob has 9 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price from Alice. Buying from John at $100 is not the most optimal choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is offering a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80.
* **Negotiation:**  This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in purchasing the product while also demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room:** The offer is still a little higher than Alice's minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has lowered her price from $90 to $87.50, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value:** While $87.50 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's close enough to his maximum of $100.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations might lead to a slightly lower price, but it also risks losing the deal to another buyer or running out of rounds.  At this point, the risk of not accepting outweighs the potential benefit of a lower price."
