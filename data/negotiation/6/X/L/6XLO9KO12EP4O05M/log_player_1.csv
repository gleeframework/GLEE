Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible. 
* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll be prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I'll be firm on my minimum price. 
* I'll keep John in mind as a safety net throughout the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me. 
* **John's Offer is a Better Option:**  I can immediately sell to John and secure a much better price.
* **Counter-Offering is Risky:**  While I could counter-offer, there's no guarantee Bob will come up to a reasonable price.  There's a risk of wasting time and potentially ending up with a lower price than John's offer.

**Strategy:** 

I'm taking the safe and profitable route by selling to John. There's no need to risk a protracted negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $1,400,000 to $1,350,000. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Profitable:** $1,350,000 is still above my minimum price of $1,500,000, so it's a good outcome for me. 
* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob. It's a clear signal that I'm serious about this price and am ready to walk away if he doesn't agree. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a quick resolution while still getting a price I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to walk away if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm hoping he recognizes the value of the product and accepts my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with an even lower price. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm choosing the most secure option by selling to John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob when I have a better deal already lined up."
