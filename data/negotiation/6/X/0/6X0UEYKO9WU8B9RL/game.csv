"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and is a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
