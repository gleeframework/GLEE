Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $10,500. I'm still $1,500 below my minimum price, and I need to get closer to what the product is worth to me.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her last offer. While continuing negotiation is possible, it's getting too close to John's $15,000 price. Cutting losses now ensures Bob gets the product without risking a worse deal from Alice."
