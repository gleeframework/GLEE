"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position. Let's make this simple. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $10,500. I'm still $1,500 below my minimum price, and I need to get closer to what the product is worth to me. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is my final concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13000.0,Alice,7,
