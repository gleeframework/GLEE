"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a fairer agreement. I am willing to pay $1,150,000 for your product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is more than my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target.  I need to balance this against the risk of losing Bob entirely, but the potential for a higher price outweighs the risk at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price given the value this product brings you.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for your product. This price aligns closely with your original valuation and also allows us to reach an agreement within my budget constraints. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  Bob has offered my minimum price, and I've already rejected his previous offer, so I'm running the risk of him walking away.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the deal."
