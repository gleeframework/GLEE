Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:**  I'm leaving myself room to negotiate.
* **It's not unreasonable:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay a premium for the product.

I'm also prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on his willingness to pay and my desire to maximize my profit. I'll also keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $18,000 to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $18,000, but it's still a good amount for me. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly better than John's offer and getting closer to my minimum. At this point, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer and ending up with John's offer instead.  It's time to lock in a sale."
