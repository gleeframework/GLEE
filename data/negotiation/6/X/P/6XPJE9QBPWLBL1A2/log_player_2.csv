Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $80.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Bob. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll go below $100.  We have a guaranteed option with John at $100, which meets our budget. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice."
