Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is far above my budget.  Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
