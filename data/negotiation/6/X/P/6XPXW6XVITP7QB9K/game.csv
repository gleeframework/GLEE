"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to consider my own costs and goals. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll go up to $12,500.  This is a fair price, and I believe it will be a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but no lower. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product brings.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to close the deal, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm confident $12,500 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to a decision, Bob, but I still need to get as much as I can for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm going to take a slightly firmer stance and offer it to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13250.0,Alice,7,
