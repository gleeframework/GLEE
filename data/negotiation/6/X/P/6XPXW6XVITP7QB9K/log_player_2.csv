"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $15,000 is too high, and he can do better. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to consider my own costs and goals. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $13,500 is closer to his target, he can still potentially get a better price. There's still room to negotiate and he has 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll go up to $12,500.  This is a fair price, and I believe it will be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but no lower. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. He's only $1,000 away from his target price, and he has 5 rounds remaining.  There's still a good chance he can get Alice down to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to close the deal, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm confident $12,500 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to a decision, Bob, but I still need to get as much as I can for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm going to take a slightly firmer stance and offer it to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  While he's only $250 away from his ideal price, Alice is being stubborn and he only has 3 rounds left.  It's better to buy from John and avoid risking getting stuck with a higher price."
