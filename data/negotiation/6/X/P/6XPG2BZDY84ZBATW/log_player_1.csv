"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I think justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $9,500. This would allow us both to walk away with a deal we can be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting $9,500 now is better than risking him walking away later for an even lower price.  It's time to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
