"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit stretched on the budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value our conversation,  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, considering your interest in the product. This price reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer the product for $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.
