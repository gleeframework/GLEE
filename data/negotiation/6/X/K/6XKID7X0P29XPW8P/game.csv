"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $8,750. How about we meet in the middle at $8,375? That's still a good price for me, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.",8375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8,375 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's compromise at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save some money. How about we go down to $8,250? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,500.",8250.0,Bob,6,
