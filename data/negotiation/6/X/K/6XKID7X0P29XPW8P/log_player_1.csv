Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8,375 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's compromise at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer more, $8,250 is still a good deal and I'm concerned that if I reject, he might walk away and I'll be forced to sell to John for less."
