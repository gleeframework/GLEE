Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly above my minimum, and closer to my asking price.
