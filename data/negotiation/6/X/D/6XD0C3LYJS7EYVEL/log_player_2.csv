"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is $140, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $130? "", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has lowered the price to $135, which is still within your budget. Accepting this offer would save you $15 compared to buying from John, so it's the best option at this point."
