{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know this product would bring significant value to your business, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:** The message subtly implies I have other interested buyers, which might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**The Goal:** This offer aims to:

1. **Ideal Scenario:**  Bob accepts the $1,400,000 price, netting me a higher profit than John's offer.
2. **Negotiation:**  If Bob counters, I have room to negotiate down slightly, potentially still exceeding $1,500,000.
3. **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer outright, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
