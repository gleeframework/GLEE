{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is far above your maximum budget of $12,000.  It's important to start negotiating to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a solution that works for both of us. After careful consideration, I am proposing a price of $13000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to your maximum budget, it's still higher than your desired price point. There's room for further negotiation, and you can likely get a lower price. You're still better off trying to negotiate a better price than buying from John at $12,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $11,000.
