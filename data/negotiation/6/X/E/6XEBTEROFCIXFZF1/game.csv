"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand your budget constraints. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000 to close the deal. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
