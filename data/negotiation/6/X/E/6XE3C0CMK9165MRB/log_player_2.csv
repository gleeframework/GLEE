"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value, it's still above Bob's maximum. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a better price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still not there.  How about $1,075,000? That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price of $1,000,000, it's still a bit higher. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price, especially with the option of buying from John at $1,000,000. It's worth pushing a little further to see if he can get Alice to meet his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,087,500 is closer to my budget, but I'm still looking to save a little more. I'm willing to offer $1,070,000 for the product.  This would allow us to finalize the deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1070000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to save a little more, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,082,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,082,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,082,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $1,082,500 is her final offer.  While it's close to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he could get from John. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice. The potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Buying from John guarantees the best price for Bob within his budget."
