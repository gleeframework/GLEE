"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while allowing for some room for negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This price accurately reflects the value I place on the product and leaves some room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $950,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This represents a significant concession from my previous offer and a significant step closer to your last offer. I believe this price reflects the value we both place on the product and is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",920000.0,Alice,7,
