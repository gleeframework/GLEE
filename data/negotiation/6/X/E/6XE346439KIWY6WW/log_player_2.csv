# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this incredible product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Alice is selling for $1,200,000, while John is selling for $1,500,000. 
* **You can save money by accepting Alice's offer.**  You'll save $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, it's still a good deal for you.** You're paying $200,000 more than what it's worth to Alice, but that's still less than what John is asking."
