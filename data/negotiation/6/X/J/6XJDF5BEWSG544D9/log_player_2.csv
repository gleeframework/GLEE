"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm starting the price at $100, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower. I have 10 rounds and can always buy from John for $120 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $20. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal.  I want to see if she's willing to compromise."
