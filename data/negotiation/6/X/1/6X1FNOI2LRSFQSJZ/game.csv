"Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product.  While I agree it could be valuable, $20,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Could you do $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget, would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my original asking price.  How about $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. $16,000 is still a little steep for me. Would you be willing to settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
