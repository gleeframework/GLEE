"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you.  My asking price is $17,000. It's a great deal considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's value to me to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also being positive and emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make him more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I need to make at least $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I need to make a bit more than $13,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's getting a bit frustrating, and I'm concerned this negotiation is going nowhere. I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $15,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a safe and sure deal."
