{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a high price:** $950,000 is a significant starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the value to Bob creates a sense of urgency and potential gain.
* **Expressing confidence:** Showing confidence in a quick deal can influence Bob's decision. 

Remember, I'm aiming for a high price while keeping in mind the potential of Bob's counteroffers and the option of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, especially considering the value of the product to him.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $800,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I continue the negotiation, aiming for a price closer to my desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, increasing the chances of a deal. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  Stating the price reflects both their needs strengthens the argument for the counteroffer. 

By offering $850,000, I'm attempting to bridge the gap between my expectations and Bob's initial offer, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $750,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Further negotiation is likely:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to reach a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  The option to sell to John for $800,000 provides me with leverage and ensures I won't settle for a price below my minimum.

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not yet ready to accept his offer.  I will continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to $850,000 or higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $750,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's try $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and leaves room for a comfortable profit for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only dropping $25,000 from my previous offer, signaling I'm serious but not desperate.
* **Focus on Win-Win:**  Emphasizing ""comfortable profit"" positions the offer as a good outcome for both parties.
* **Urgency & Enthusiasm:**  ""Let's make this deal happen"" creates a sense of urgency and positive energy.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we both deserve a fair profit. How about we split the difference and settle at $787,500? That seems like a win-win to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $787,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob's willingness to split the difference shows a desire for a deal, so further negotiation is possible.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I can still sell to John for $800,000, providing a safety net and leverage in the negotiation.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $787,500 is close, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?

```

**Reasoning:**
