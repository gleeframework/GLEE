"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, hoping to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation.  It's also important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I believe I can get closer to $120 if I continue negotiating. I'm also mindful of John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to what he's willing to pay, I'm still not happy with the price. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  John's offer is still a strong backup, so I have the flexibility to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, hoping to close the deal at this price point. He's shown a willingness to move up, and I'm willing to come down. This feels like a good compromise, and I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get him higher. It's not worth risking another round for a small increase when I have a guaranteed $120 from John.  I'm going to take the secure offer."
