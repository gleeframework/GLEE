# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $10,750. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to the table.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer. Accepting at $11,250 secures a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Alice walking away, leaving me with the less appealing option."
