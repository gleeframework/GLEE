"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is way too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.  Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would save me a good amount.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your budget, but I'm sticking to my price floor. I'm willing to go down to $8,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal now.",8000.0,Alice,5,
