"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
$6,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell it for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is way too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would save me a good amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $7,500 is closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum. I'm not desperate to sell and John is a reliable buyer. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your budget, but I'm sticking to my price floor. I'm willing to go down to $8,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 8000}
