Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need at least $80 to make this sale worthwhile.
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $150.
* **Negotiation space:** There's a $70 difference between our minimum and his maximum. 
* **Offering 120:** This is a fair offer, as it's a compromise that leaves both of us with a profit. I get $40 more than my minimum, and Bob saves $30.

While I could ask for more, there's a higher chance of Bob rejecting the offer.  A $120 offer gives me a good chance of maximizing my profit while also potentially securing a sale."
