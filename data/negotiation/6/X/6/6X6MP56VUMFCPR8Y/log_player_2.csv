Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is not even close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which will give you added peace of mind and value. I'm sticking with my previous price of $950,000, but I hope these extras will make it more appealing to you.

Round 7

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to making a decision, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll throw in an additional 2-year maintenance contract, which will give you even more value for your money. I'm sticking with $925,000, but I hope the extra contract will seal the deal.

Alice has come down significantly and is now offering additional benefits. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and at $925,000, you're getting a good price below your $1,000,000 walk-away point."
