"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is not even close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider $900,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which will give you added peace of mind and value. I'm sticking with my previous price of $950,000, but I hope these extras will make it more appealing to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the added warranty and support package, it definitely adds value.  However, to be completely transparent, my budget is really capped at $925,000.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to making a decision, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll throw in an additional 2-year maintenance contract, which will give you even more value for your money. I'm sticking with $925,000, but I hope the extra contract will seal the deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
