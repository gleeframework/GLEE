,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I can offer it to you for $170. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still not sure if $170 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $155. I think that's a fair price for a product that I'm interested in, but I'm not sure if it's worth more than that.",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $155. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I can offer it to you for $165. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise.",165.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $165, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to go up to $160, but no higher. I think that's a fair price for a product that I'm interested in, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at that price.",160.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $165. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to hold firm at that price. If you're not willing to meet me at $165, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",165.0,Alice,9,
