"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
