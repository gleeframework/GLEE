Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special discounted price of $14,000. I think it would be a great value at this price, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer it for a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), aiming higher has the potential for greater profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle if he's eager.
* **Backup Plan:**  It's important to remember I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This knowledge allows me to be firm with Bob and not go below a price that would be unprofitable."
