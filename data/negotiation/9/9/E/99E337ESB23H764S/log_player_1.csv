"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal and leave room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to be friendly and emphasize the value Bob will get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum threshold of $15,000 and also leaves little room for further negotiations.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. How about $16,000?  That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm not sure if we can reach an agreement.  I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $14,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. It's your last chance to buy it from me.  "", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sorry, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's my final offer. Please consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. We've gone back and forth a few times, and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
