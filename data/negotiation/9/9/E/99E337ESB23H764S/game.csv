"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. How about $16,000?  That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $14,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. It's your last chance to buy it from me.  ",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's my final offer. Please consider it.",13500.0,Bob,6,
