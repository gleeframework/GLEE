"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value it provides.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $120 for this product.  That's my final offer.  What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
