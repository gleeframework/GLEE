"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $950,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves some room for both of us to get a good deal. Let's finalize this transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a small concession to get the deal done. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once more.",880000.0,Alice,5,
