Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product and think it's worth it, but I have to be mindful of my finances. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
