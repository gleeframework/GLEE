"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate lower.  There are 9 rounds left, and I can always buy from John if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70} 
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$85 is still too high. I'm willing to go slightly higher than my previous counteroffer, but I'm not ready to accept yet.  There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $82.50, which is only $2.50 above my last offer. I'm confident that I can't get a much better deal. We are getting close to the middle ground and there's no point in risking losing the deal, especially since I can always buy from John for $150. It's time to take the deal and move on."
