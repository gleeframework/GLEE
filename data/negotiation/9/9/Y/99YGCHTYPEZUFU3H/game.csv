"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1800000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you could be even higher.  What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1600000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1700000? This would still allow you to get a great deal on a valuable product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $1650000?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1650000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again -  let's settle on $1675000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you say?",1675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1675000 is too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, as I mentioned before. Can we stick with that price?",1650000.0,Bob,6,
