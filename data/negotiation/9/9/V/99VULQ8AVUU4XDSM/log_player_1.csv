Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I'm well above my minimum price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing his willingness to pay.
* **Secure a Deal:** By offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, there's a good chance he'll accept, avoiding the need to sell to John for $8,000."
