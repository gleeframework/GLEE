,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $10,000, especially considering its long-term benefits. How about we meet halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $13,000. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
