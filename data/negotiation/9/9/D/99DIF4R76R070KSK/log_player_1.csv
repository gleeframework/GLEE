Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Bob values the product significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price, we start with an offer closer to his perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is ambitious, it leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still arrive at a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Justification for the price:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus towards the long-term benefits rather than just the immediate cost. 

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
