"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping it will be more appealing to Bob while still being higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is lower than John's offer of $10,000.  It's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to get a higher price from Bob. Therefore, I will sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
