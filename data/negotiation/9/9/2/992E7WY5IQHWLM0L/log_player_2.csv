# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's asking $95. This means she has room to negotiate. I'll try to get a better price from her."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
