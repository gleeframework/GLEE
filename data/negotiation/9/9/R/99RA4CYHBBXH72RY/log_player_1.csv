Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is more than what Bob values the product at ($8,000), giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $10,000 is below your minimum of $12,000, leaving room for potential negotiation without risking you accepting a price below your minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and outlines the offer without unnecessary fluff.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation at a price that is favorable to you while still leaving room for Bob to counter and potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired outcome. You have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, so it's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if you can get closer to your target price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore a higher counteroffer:**  You can propose a price closer to your minimum, aiming for a compromise.

**Next Step:**

You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer. Consider a price between $9,500 and your minimum of $12,000. A good starting point might be $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** This counteroffer bridges the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Motivating factor:**  The message highlights the value proposition for Bob (""fair price for both of us"" and ""very happy with this product""), encouraging him to reconsider.
* **Maintaining leverage:** The counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation, giving you more control in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $10,800 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,800 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired outcome. Bob has stated this is his final offer. Considering you have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, it makes more sense to accept John's offer and secure the higher price. 

This decision ensures you achieve your minimum goal and avoid further negotiation that might risk you settling for a lower price."
