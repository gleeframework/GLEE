Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and allows me to secure a profitable sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $950,000 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, so I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to secure a valuable asset at a competitive rate, and me to gain a good return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 975000}
