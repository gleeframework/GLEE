``` 

It's too early to buy from John, as Alice might come down in price. Let's see if we can get a better deal from her first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to meet me halfway.  $9,000 is a fair starting point, given her $10,000 value and my $10,000 ceiling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still too high. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my $9,000 offer, but I'll try to get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but still keeps me within my budget and closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price. While $10,500 is slightly above my initial target, it's still within my budget and worth accepting to avoid further negotiation rounds. I'm happy to secure the product with a small compromise."
