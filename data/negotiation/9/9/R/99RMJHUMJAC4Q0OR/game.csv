"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position. I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
