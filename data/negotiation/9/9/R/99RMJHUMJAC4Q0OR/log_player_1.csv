{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It also demonstrates my willingness to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $9,500. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still do better. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
