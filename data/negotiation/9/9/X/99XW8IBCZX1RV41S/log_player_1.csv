"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to the maximum Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:** My message is confident and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm open to Bob's response and willing to negotiate. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I keep John in mind as a backup buyer, allowing me to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **I have 8 rounds left.** There's still time to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a better price.
* **John is a safety net.** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can still sell to John for $10,000. 

**Next Round:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my starting point, aiming to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a significant saving compared to the initial price, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the savings Bob will get compared to the initial price. 
* **Positive tone:** I use a friendly and positive tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to further negotiation if necessary, but I'm not going below my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save more. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now above my minimum desired price of $10,000.**  This means I'm making a profit and reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **We're close to a deal.** Bob has moved closer to my asking price, and further negotiation could be lengthy.
* **Time is a factor.**  I've already gone through several rounds, and it's important to close the deal before running out of time.

**Next Steps:**

While I'm accepting this offer, I'll continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer if the deal falls through later."
