**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice has consistently moved closer to our target price.  $990,000 is a reasonable deal, and there's a risk Alice could become less flexible in later rounds. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the much higher price."
