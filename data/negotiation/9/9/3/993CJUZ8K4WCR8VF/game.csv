"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
