"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm confident we can negotiate a more favorable price in the remaining rounds.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still determined to get a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round and try to close the deal closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  While $1,050,000 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,075,000. This price is fair for both of us and ensures we can finalize this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob.  He's stuck at $1,050,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is above my minimum threshold. I'll take the secure deal with John and move on."
