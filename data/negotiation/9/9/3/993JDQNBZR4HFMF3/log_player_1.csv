{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher price. It's important to start strong and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $140 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. John is guaranteed to buy the product for $150, so I will sell the product to John."
