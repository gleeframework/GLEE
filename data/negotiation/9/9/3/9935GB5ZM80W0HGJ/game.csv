"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the reduction, but I still feel that $1400000 is out of my budget. Could you consider selling the product for $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1350000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1375000.  This is the final price I'm willing to go down to. If you're serious about acquiring this product, let's close the deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
