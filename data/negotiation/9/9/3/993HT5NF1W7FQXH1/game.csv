"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $20000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $15000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price closer to the midpoint between our current positions? I suggest offering the product for $17500. This allows us to bridge the gap while still considering the value both of us place on the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,
