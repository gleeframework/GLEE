"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a bit closer to his budget, it's still over his preferred price point, and he can get the product for less from John. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is my best offer, so let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it to make sense.  This is a very fair offer for a product this good.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is getting closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for less. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  He has a few rounds left and there's still room to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
