"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $140. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a quick deal at a good price. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering at $120. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's still a fair price considering Bob's willingness to pay $80. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $110. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's reasonably profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again and see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round and offer $105.  I'm running out of rounds, and this is close enough to my minimum that it's worth trying.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
