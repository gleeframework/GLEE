"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his budget than Alice's initial value, it's still higher than his desired price. It's worth attempting to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still a reasonable starting point. He's aiming to get closer to his maximum budget while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is within Bob's budget, and while it's not his ideal price, it's a good compromise.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer (John) increases with each round. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risk losing it altogether."
