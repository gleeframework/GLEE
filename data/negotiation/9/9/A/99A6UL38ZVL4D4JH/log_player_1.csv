Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,400,000, reflecting the inherent value and potential this product offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing John acts as a safety net at $1,500,000, Alice aims to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling on a price higher than $1,000,000 but lower than $1,500,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price and make him feel good about a potential purchase.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Alice's negotiation style and perceived risk tolerance, she could start with a higher price closer to $1,500,000."
