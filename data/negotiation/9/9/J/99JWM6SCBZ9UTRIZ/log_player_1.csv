Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential for you, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) while ensuring a sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward, while still remaining comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder opening offer to Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while mitigating the risk of losing the sale entirely."
