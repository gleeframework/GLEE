"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm sure we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Would you be willing to consider $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,875. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,875, which would be $8,687.50. Can you consider this offer?",8687.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $8,687.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, at $8,781.25. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our positions.",8781.25,Alice,7,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,781.25. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,781.25, which would be $8,640.75. Can you consider this offer?",8640.75,Bob,8,
