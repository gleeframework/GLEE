"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Unknown Value to Bob:**  I don't know Bob's value for the product.  By starting high, I force Bob to reveal his interest level and potential willingness to pay. 

**Strategy:**

* I will observe Bob's response (accept, reject, or counteroffer).
* I'll then adjust my offers based on his behavior. 
* If Bob counteroffers, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. 
* I have the option to walk away and sell to John at any point, but I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still leaves room for improvement. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation.  I'll proceed to round 3 and counteroffer with a price that's more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze how much higher I can realistically push the price while still keeping Bob engaged. 
* I'll consider factors like Bob's potential need for the product, my own time constraints, and the risk of losing him as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Act:**  I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's last offer but still reasonable enough to keep him interested. 
* **Compromise:** A price of $1,650,000 represents a compromise between my initial offer of $1,800,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
* **Signal of Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but I still value the product highly. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. If he accepts this offer, I've secured a good deal.
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round. 
* I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Price:** Bob's offer has dropped to $1,400,000, which is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value but still lower than my desired price.
* **Time is on My Side:**  We are only in Round 4.  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating for a better price. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** I'm aware of the risk of losing the deal entirely, but I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer Again:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to his last offer but still higher than my minimum.  This will signal to Bob that I'm willing to compromise but not give in to his pressure.
* **Observe Bob's Behavior:**  I'll carefully observe Bob's responses. If he seems increasingly unwilling to negotiate, I might consider selling to John in the next round or two. 

**Next Steps:**

*  I need to determine a counteroffer that balances the need to secure a sale with the desire to maximize my profit. 
*  I'll analyze the overall negotiation dynamics and Bob's likely response to my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $1,500,000, which is halfway between Bob's last offer of $1,400,000 and my previous offer of $1,650,000.  This demonstrates a clear willingness to compromise.
* **Final Stand:** I believe this price is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept at this stage. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer, but I'm also aware that we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Decision Point:** This offer will be a critical point in the negotiation. 
* **Prepare for Potential Exit:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider my options: 
    * **Counteroffer:**  I'll only counteroffer again if I believe there's still a high chance of reaching a deal.
    * **Selling to John:**  If I believe the chances of a deal with Bob are slim, I'll be prepared to sell to John and secure a guaranteed price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's reaction to this offer and make a strategic decision based on his response and the overall negotiation dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Price:** Bob's offer has continued to decrease to $1,350,000, which is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not ideal.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are in Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the time pressure is increasing.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  While I don't want to accept a price that undervalues the product, I also don't want to lose the deal completely.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer Again:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his last offer, but still lower than my previous offer. This will signal to Bob that I am willing to compromise but also demonstrate that I value the product. 
* **Evaluate Options:**  I will carefully evaluate Bob's response and the overall negotiation dynamics to determine if I should consider selling to John in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

* I need to determine a counteroffer that balances the need to secure a sale with the desire to maximize my profit while considering the time constraints.
* I'll analyze the overall negotiation dynamics and Bob's likely response to my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Pressure:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to find a middle ground.  $1,450,000 is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's.  It also applies pressure on Bob to consider closing the deal.
* **Close to Minimum:**  This price is still significantly higher than my minimum, but I recognize I may have to make a concession to reach an agreement.
* **Potential for Deal:**  By offering a price close to his last counteroffer, I'm signaling my willingness to conclude the deal. 

**Strategy:**

* **Decision Point:** This offer represents a crucial point in the negotiation. I need to assess if Bob is genuinely interested in closing the deal or if he's simply trying to push for a lower price.
* **Preparing for the Final Rounds:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will carefully analyze his response and consider my options in the remaining rounds. If it seems unlikely we will reach an agreement, I might consider selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this offer and make a strategic decision based on his response and the overall negotiation dynamics.  I'll need to weigh the risk of losing the deal against the potential for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value, there's still a slight gap.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are now in Round 8, with only two rounds left. There's increasing pressure to close a deal.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** I'm aware of the risk of losing the deal completely if I reject Bob's offer again. However, I believe there's still a chance to push for a slightly better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer Again:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's slightly higher than his last offer but still lower than my previous offer. This will signal to Bob that I am willing to compromise but also demonstrate that I value the product. 
* **Evaluate Options:** I will carefully evaluate Bob's response and the overall negotiation dynamics to determine if I should consider selling to John in the final round.

**Next Steps:**

* I need to determine a counteroffer that balances the need to secure a sale with the desire to maximize my profit while considering the time constraints.
* I'll analyze the overall negotiation dynamics and Bob's likely response to my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  With only one round left, I'm making a final compromise. This price is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, signaling my willingness to close the deal.
* **Avoiding John:** While John's offer is guaranteed, I'd rather get a slightly higher price from Bob if possible. This offer gives Bob a chance to accept without risking a complete deal breakdown.
* **High Stakes:**  This is my last chance to get a better price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to accept John's offer to avoid losing the deal altogether.

**Strategy:**

* **All or Nothing:** This is a high-stakes offer. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in finalizing a deal, even if it's slightly lower than my initial goal.
* **Prepared for John:**  I've mentally prepared myself to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer. My goal is to maximize profit, but I also recognize the importance of securing a sale.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll carefully watch Bob's reaction to this offer.  If he accepts, we'll have a deal.  If he rejects, it's time to call John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation. I've reached the limit of my flexibility.
* **Close but No Cigar:** While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum, it's still not ideal.
* **Guaranteeing the Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum acceptable value.  There's no longer any room for negotiation with Bob, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure the Deal:**  By selling to John, I ensure a sale and avoid the potential of a complete breakdown in negotiations with Bob.
* **Lesson Learned:** I've learned valuable lessons about negotiation and the importance of setting clear minimums and recognizing when to cut my losses. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll move forward with the sale to John and focus on future opportunities to improve my negotiation skills."
