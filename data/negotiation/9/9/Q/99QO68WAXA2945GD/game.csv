"Alice, your price is too high. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is fair considering my maximum budget. Let's make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is closer to my bottom line considering the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500, which is a significant compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,500 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference and call it $9,250? This would be my final offer.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer, but $9,250 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal, I'm ready to buy.",9000.0,Bob,6,
