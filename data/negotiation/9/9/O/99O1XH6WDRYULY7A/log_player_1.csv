Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's a common tactic to start with a higher price than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate downwards and potentially still get a good price.
* **Positive tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and positive can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $100 is a good starting point, I'm willing to drop the price if Bob makes a reasonable counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product but would be happy to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is below my minimum of $80. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum, potentially securing a better deal.  
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to buy for $80 gives me the security to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering $85, which is halfway between Bob's offer of $75 and my minimum of $80. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob about the product's quality can make him more willing to pay a higher price. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone can encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $80.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob has offered my minimum price of $80. 
* **No further room for negotiation:**  There's no incentive to reject this offer and risk Bob backing out completely.
* **Selling to John offers no additional benefit:**  John would pay the same price as Bob.

Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice to secure a sale and avoid potentially losing the deal."
