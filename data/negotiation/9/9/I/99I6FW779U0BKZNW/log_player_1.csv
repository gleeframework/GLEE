Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than your minimum ($10,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves room for him to negotiate down, while still ensuring a profit for you.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message implies the product's value without being overly aggressive. This approach increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a safety net (selling to John) if Bob declines."
