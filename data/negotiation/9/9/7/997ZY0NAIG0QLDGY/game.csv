"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about $75?  That's a fair jump from my last offer and puts us closer to a price I think we can both agree on.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $90? It's still a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
