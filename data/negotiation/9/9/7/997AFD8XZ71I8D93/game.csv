"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to make one final offer of $1,050,000. This reflects a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from this product. If this isn't acceptable, I will need to move forward with another buyer who has already offered my asking price. Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
