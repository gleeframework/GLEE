"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. There are 9 more rounds, so there is room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still reflects the value of the product to Bob. This will encourage Alice to continue the negotiation and hopefully find a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are still 7 rounds left, so there's ample opportunity to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially secure an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $10,800 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,650. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It's a smaller decrease from Alice's offer than in the previous round, indicating that Bob is getting closer to his desired price. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming to save as much money as possible.  There are 6 rounds remaining, so there's still room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'll offer the product to you for $10,700. It's a small concession, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there are 5 rounds remaining. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. However, $10,700 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,675. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10675}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small but significant counteroffer. It shows a willingness to compromise while also demonstrating that he's still aiming for a price closer to his ideal. This tactic maintains pressure on Alice and may encourage her to accept the offer, especially with only 4 rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession. I'll offer the product to you for $10,650. It's a tiny adjustment, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,650 is within Bob's budget and is only $150 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely Bob will be able to get a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
