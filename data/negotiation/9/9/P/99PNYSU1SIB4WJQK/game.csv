"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, $800000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a happy medium.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can land closer to my initial offer. How about $650000? That seems like a reasonable price for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
