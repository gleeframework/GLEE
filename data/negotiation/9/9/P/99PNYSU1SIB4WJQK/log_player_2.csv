"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first.  There's a chance she's willing to lower the price, especially if she wants to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a happy medium."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $700,000 is a good price, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can land closer to my initial offer. How about $650,000? That seems like a reasonable price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $675000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $675,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last offer. This is a good deal for Bob considering his goal is to save as much as possible. It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.  Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
