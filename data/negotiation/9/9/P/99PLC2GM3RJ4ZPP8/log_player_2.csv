"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than $8000 to me and I know you value it at $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than the $15,000 you would pay to John.  This means you save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer.  While you may be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal and being forced to pay John's higher price."
