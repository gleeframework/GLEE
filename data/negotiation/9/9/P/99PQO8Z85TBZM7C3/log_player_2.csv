"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is less than the product's worth to Alice ($150), it's still more than your maximum budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a price that's still slightly above my maximum budget of $100, but it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $110 is now within my budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $100. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, and I risk losing the product altogether.  Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
