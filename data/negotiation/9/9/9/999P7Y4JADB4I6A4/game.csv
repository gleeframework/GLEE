"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new offer. I'm thinking of selling the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get the same product from John for this price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
