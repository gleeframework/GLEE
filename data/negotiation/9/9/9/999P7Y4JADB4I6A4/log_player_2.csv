"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have a better option with John, who's selling for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new offer. I'm thinking of selling the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what you can get from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more with Alice.  You can potentially get closer to your $950,000 target with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,025,000, it's still above the price John is offering. Since you have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000 with John, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for a better price from John."
