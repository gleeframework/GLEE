{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources and opening new opportunities.  Given its unique nature, I'm offering it to you at $1,350,000.  I'm confident this price reflects its true worth and offers us both a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, but not so high that it's insulting or unreasonable.
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasizing the product's benefits to Bob increases its perceived value and justifies the high price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a fallback option with John, ensuring I won't go below my minimum selling price."
