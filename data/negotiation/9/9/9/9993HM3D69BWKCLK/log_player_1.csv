Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on the price."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000,  Alice knows it's worth $15,000 to her and has a guaranteed buyer at that price. Starting with a high offer of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's valuation.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is structured to be open-ended, encouraging Bob to counter-offer and reveal how interested he is in the product. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has the security of John's offer, so she's not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer.  Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, a different approach might be more effective."
