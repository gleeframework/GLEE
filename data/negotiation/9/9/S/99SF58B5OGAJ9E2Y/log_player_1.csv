"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that can bring significant returns.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product, not just the price. This helps frame the negotiation around the potential benefits Bob will receive. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiating, suggesting a willingness to compromise. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob immediately. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $900,000 is significantly less than my desired price. While it's closer to his perceived value, it's still not a good deal for me. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I still have leverage. I'm not in a desperate situation, and I can use this round to test the waters for a higher price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him I'm serious about getting a price closer to my desired range.  This might push him to increase his offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away from a bad deal.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while still ensuring I receive a reasonable return.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm not rejecting Bob's offer outright, but I'm also not accepting it.  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but still keeping it significantly higher than his offer.
* **Maintain Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and why it's worth more than his initial offer.
* **Fair Price Justification:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential adjustments.

This counteroffer balances my desire for a higher price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below the value I'm willing to accept. $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, which is positive. By rejecting his offer, I can encourage him to continue increasing his bid.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for a higher offer from Bob. With each round, he's moving closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm not desperate. John provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob comes closer to my expectations. 

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to push the price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to meet me halfway.  However, $950,000 still falls short of the value this product represents. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price recognizes your needs while ensuring I receive a fair return. Let's reach a final agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm lowering my price again, showing flexibility but staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Mutually Beneficial Outcome:**  I'm re-emphasizing that a deal at this price would be good for both of us. 
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this is the last round for negotiation, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I still have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that's significantly below my desired price. 

This counteroffer aims to push Bob to accept a price closer to my goal while also increasing the chances of a successful deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product, but I think we're getting close to a fair price. Can you meet me halfway and consider $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to settle for a deal that undervalues my product.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  Bob is clearly committed to acquiring the product, and he's increasing his offer.  This shows potential for further negotiation.
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially given the value of the product and my guaranteed alternative offer from John.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a safety net, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can achieve a more favorable outcome.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and we're definitely making progress.  However, $975,000 still doesn't reflect the full value of this product.  Let's find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a compromise that acknowledges your budget while ensuring I receive a fair return.  Let's aim to finalize this deal in the next round."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my offer again, but keeping it above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Progress:**  I acknowledge the progress we've made in negotiations, making it clear that I'm taking Bob's offers into consideration.
* **Urgency:**  I emphasize finalizing the deal in the next round to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Balance:**  I'm aiming for a price that is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value, making the deal more likely to be accepted.
* **John as a Backup:**  I can still fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000, giving me the leverage to hold out for a slightly higher price."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll accept the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Low Offer:** Bob is firm on $990,000, which is still below my desired price and close to my minimum.
* **Limited Upside:** There's little room for improvement in further negotiations. Bob has already shown a strong desire to close the deal at this price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a safer and more profitable option than taking the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

While I'm not thrilled about selling for $1,000,000 instead of my initial goal, it's the most pragmatic decision given the limited time and the likelihood of Bob not increasing his offer further."
