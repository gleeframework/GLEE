Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum asking price of $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your business, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This would give us both a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, I'm still not at my minimum asking price of $1,000,000. I think I can push for a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk not reaching a deal.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future if I need to sell another product."
