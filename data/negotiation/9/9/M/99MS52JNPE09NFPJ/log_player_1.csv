Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It allows for some negotiation room while still exceeding my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  I believe Bob will be willing to negotiate further, knowing he values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's initial offer. It still leaves room for further negotiation while staying above my minimum desired price."
