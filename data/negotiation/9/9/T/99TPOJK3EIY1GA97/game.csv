"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it, as that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and potential benefits.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750000.  It's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident this product is worth that to me. ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I still think $750000 is below the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. I'll offer you the product for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to an agreement, Bob. However, I've already offered you the product at $825000, which is below my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $825000, or I'll have to consider other options. Let's try to finalize the deal at $825000.",825000.0,Alice,7,
