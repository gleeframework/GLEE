"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $100,000 over Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it, as that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if a lower price is possible.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000.  It's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident this product is worth that to me. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I still think $750000 is below the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. I'll offer you the product for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $825,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially get even closer to his desired price and potentially secure a better deal.  It's also possible Alice will be willing to meet Bob at $800,000 given they are close to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to an agreement, Bob. However, I've already offered you the product at $825000, which is below my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $825000, or I'll have to consider other options. Let's try to finalize the deal at $825000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $825,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While there's a chance of further negotiation, it's becoming risky to continue.  Bob has two options:

* **Continue negotiating:**  There's a chance Alice might budge and agree to Bob's offer of $800,000, but there's also a chance she won't, leading to a lost deal.
* **Buy from John:**  This is a guaranteed deal for the product at Bob's maximum budget.  It removes the risk of further negotiations and potential delays.

Given the limited rounds remaining and the potential for a lost deal, Bob's best option is to secure the product at a known price by buying from John."
