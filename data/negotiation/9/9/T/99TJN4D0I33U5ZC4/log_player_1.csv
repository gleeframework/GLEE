Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Above your minimum:**  $10,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Not too high:**  It's not an outrageous price that might instantly scare Bob away.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates that you're open to discussion and willing to work with Bob. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still being open to a reasonable deal. By starting at $10,000, you leave room for Bob to counteroffer, and you can then adjust your price based on his response and how much you think the product is worth to him."
