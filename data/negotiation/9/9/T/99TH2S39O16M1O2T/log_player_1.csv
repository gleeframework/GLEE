Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $17,000. How about we try to get closer to the price I was initially willing to pay? I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would be a $1,500 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut our losses and sell to John."
