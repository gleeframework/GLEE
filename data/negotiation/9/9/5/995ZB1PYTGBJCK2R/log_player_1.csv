Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth much more to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob in my message to encourage him to accept.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, but this initial offer sets a strong starting point. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and consider my options:

* **Accept Counteroffer:** If it's close to my target, I'll accept.
* **Counter Offer:** If it's significantly lower, I'll counter again, trying to stay above $12,000 (my minimum acceptable price). 
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll sell to John to guarantee at least $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but I'm really looking to stay under $13,000.  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  I want to maximize my profit, and $13,000 is still lower than my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to increase the price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get closer to my goal of $14,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $13,000.  I'll aim for a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language (""good deal"") to encourage Bob to see this as a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $13,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'm not giving away too much.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly higher price, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while also demonstrating that I believe the product is worth more.  I'm hoping this will lead to a quick and successful agreement."
