"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that I value at least $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You stand to save $20 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
