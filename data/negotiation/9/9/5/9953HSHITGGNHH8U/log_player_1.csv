"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a higher price, but also gives Bob a reason to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I could sell to John for $120, I want to try to get closer to my desired price by negotiating with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that amount. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I want to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm also aware that John is waiting to buy the product for $120, so I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle at $120, which is fair for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
