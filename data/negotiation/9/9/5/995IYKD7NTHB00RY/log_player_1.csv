{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. I'm confident it's also a good value for you, considering your potential gains.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  I have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your desired price while still being a profitable deal for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $925,000 is closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $1,200,000.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $925,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $940,000, which is a more reasonable compromise. This allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'll try to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $915,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $915,000 is still below my desired price, and I have only 4 rounds left.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price, so I'm going to take John's offer of $1,200,000."
