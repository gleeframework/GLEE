You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering $90. It's worth trying to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $87.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $87.50 is still within my budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $100.  I'm willing to accept this offer."
