"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to test the waters with a significantly higher price. I can always lower my price in subsequent rounds if needed.  If Bob rejects, I'll see where he stands and make a counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a lot, I'm aiming for more. I'll counter with a higher price and see if I can bridge the gap.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal than John's offer, so I'm not going to sell to him just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but also high enough to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'm staying firm on my desire for a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for more, this is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out to John.  It's a win for me, as I'm getting my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can do better in the remaining rounds."
