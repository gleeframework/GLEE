"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $9,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750? That's the best I can do, and I hope it's something you're willing to consider.",8750.0,Bob,4,
