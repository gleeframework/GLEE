"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1350000 is closer to my starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1425000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,3,
