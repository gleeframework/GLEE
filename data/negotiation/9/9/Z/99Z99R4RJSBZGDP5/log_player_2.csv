"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in moving forward with! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice knows your upper limit is $15,000 and is starting high. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get a better price closer to her $8,000 value."
