Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but I need to be closer to $20,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $18,500?"",
""product_price"": 18500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $16,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table if I accept $16,000. I'm willing to push a bit further to try and secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. How about $17,250? That reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, and I would like to propose a price of $16,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's unlikely to go much higher than $16,500. Accepting this offer secures a profit above John's standing offer, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away entirely."
