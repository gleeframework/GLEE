Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a great deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down further to $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me. I believe this is a good compromise. Let's close the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $850,000. You have the option to purchase the product from John for $800,000, saving you money and ending the negotiation process.  It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John."
