Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a great deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down further to $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me. I believe this is a good compromise. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
