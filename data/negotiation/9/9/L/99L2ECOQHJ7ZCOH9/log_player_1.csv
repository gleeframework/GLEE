Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and assess if it's worth negotiating further or if I should just take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $975,000. It's a compromise, but still closer to my initial asking price. I believe this shows I'm serious about selling to him, while still keeping the possibility of a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.  The negotiations have gone back and forth, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely by continuing to counteroffer.  $925,000 is a good profit, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
