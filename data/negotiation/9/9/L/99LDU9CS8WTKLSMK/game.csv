"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept your offer at $140. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a middle ground at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $160 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $155. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product right now.",155.0,Bob,4,
