{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $1,800,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price before accepting or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to start strong and show Alice that you are serious about getting a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if a more favorable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly to $1,650,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still being within his budget.  It's a good strategy to inch closer to Alice's price point but avoid reaching her initial price."
