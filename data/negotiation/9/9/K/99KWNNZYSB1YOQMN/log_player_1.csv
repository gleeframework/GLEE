Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's still within a reasonable range considering the product's worth to him.  I'll see how he responds before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will show him I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not willing to settle for his lowball price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already at round 4.  Selling to John would give me the guaranteed $1,500,000, but  $1,650,000 is a good deal, and we're running out of time."
