"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the right price for me. I'd like to try to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. How about $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to protect my minimum acceptable price.

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $10,200 is the right price for me. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,7,
