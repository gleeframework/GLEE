{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love!  I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows you to earn a decent profit.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and am interested in purchasing it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum desired price of $100. You have a chance to get a better deal, so let's see if you can negotiate a higher price!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to work with you.  While $100 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a little. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  This gives you a great price and still allows me to cover my costs.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
