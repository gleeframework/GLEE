"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still a little ways off. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $9,750 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference -  $10,125. I'm confident you'll find this price fair and a good investment in this product.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we settle at $9,900? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,900 is still a bit below my minimum.  However, to show my good faith, I'm willing to lower my price to $10,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,7,
