"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals to Bob that you're serious about getting a good price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I need to secure a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum. It also keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'm tempted by the security of selling to John, I'm going to try one more counteroffer.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is another slight decrease, showing continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  This is my last chance to secure a price above $1,000,000 before I sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I've already made several concessions. I've reached the point where I'm better off selling to John for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't risk losing out on a reasonable price."
