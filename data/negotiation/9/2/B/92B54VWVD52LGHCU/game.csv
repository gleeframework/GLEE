"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for a fair profit for you.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
