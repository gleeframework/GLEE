Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for a fair profit for you.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
