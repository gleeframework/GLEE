Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  The offer aims to capture a significant portion of the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, it leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still well above your minimum.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of securing a much higher price than John's offer makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
