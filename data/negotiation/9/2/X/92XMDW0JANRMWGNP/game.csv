,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
