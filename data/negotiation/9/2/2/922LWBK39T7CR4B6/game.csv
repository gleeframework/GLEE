"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love it!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $13,200, but that's as low as I can go. This is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",13200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I'm still very interested but $13,200 is a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,100?",12100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,100. I can do $12,800, and that's my final offer on the lower end. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I understand this is your final offer, but I can't quite reach $12,800.  Would you consider $12,300? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are.",12300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,800. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,300 and $12,800, which would be $12,550. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to close the deal.",12550.0,Alice,7,
