"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How does $90 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's offer of $100, but it's still not the best possible price.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or buy from John at $100."
