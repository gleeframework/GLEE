"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be very beneficial for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $16,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
