"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1000000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially since you don't know Alice's true value for the product. There's potential to get a better price, and even if you don't, you have the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750000 is too far below my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000?  This is a truly unique product with significant value, and I believe this price reflects that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to accept $900,000 yet.  By rejecting, I can continue to try and push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value we've discussed.  Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
