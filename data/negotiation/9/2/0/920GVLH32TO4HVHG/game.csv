"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1000000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750000 is too far below my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000?  This is a truly unique product with significant value, and I believe this price reflects that.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value we've discussed.  Let's try to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
