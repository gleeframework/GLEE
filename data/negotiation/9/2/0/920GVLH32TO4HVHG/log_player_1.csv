Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to try to get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750,000 is too far below my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This is a truly unique product with significant value, and I believe this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value we've discussed.  Let's try to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
Bob's offer of $850,000 is close to my minimum price and likely the best I can get. I'll accept his offer."
