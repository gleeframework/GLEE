"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer of $80. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit far from your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a bit more. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $84. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",84.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to pay $81.50, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere closer to $80. Can you do any better than that?",81.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay $81.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $81.50 and $84, which would be $82.75. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",82.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than $81. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from another seller. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make a decision soon.",81.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product and need to make a decision soon. I'm willing to meet you at $81, but I'd like to throw in a small bonus, such as a free accessory or a discount on a future purchase, to sweeten the deal. Would that be something you'd be interested in?",81.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus you offered, but I'm still not willing to pay $81. I'm willing to meet you at $80, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to sell it to me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",80.0,Bob,10,
