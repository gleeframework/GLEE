# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
