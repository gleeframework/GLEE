"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $85 for it.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $90? It's still a great price for a product that's worth $100 to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that we can find a better price. I would like to propose $87 for the product.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  $87 is still a bit too low for me.  To show you I'm willing to meet you halfway, I'll go down to $89. If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal.",89.0,Alice,5,
