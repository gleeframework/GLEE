Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and why the higher price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding. Phrases like ""I'm proposing"" and ""What do you think?""  signal that I'm open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Important Note:** While I have a backup buyer, John, it's generally better to secure a deal with Bob first.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
