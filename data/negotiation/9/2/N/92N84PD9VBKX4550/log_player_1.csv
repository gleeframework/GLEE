{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product. I believe it's a great value, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value of $10,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to potentially negotiate a higher price or move on to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable with the deal.  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is more in line with my expectations.  Selling to John minimizes risk and ensures a fair return."
