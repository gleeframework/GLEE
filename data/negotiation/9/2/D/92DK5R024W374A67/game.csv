"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a competitive price, and I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product and am interested in purchasing it. However, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? This would allow me to acquire the product at a price closer to its perceived value to me, while still providing you with a fair return on your investment. I look forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to meet in the middle on this.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to accept $8,500. I would like to propose an offer of $8,000, which aligns more closely with what I am willing to pay for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",8000.0,Bob,4,
