{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:**  I'm willing to go down to $12,000 to sell to John, so there's a $2,000 buffer before I have to consider that alternative.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the need to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8000 for it. Would you consider accepting this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** By offering $9,500, I'm showing willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:** I emphasize that this price still offers him a good deal.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The message avoids being confrontational and aims to build a sense of cooperation.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my position. I appreciate the adjustment, but I am still unable to meet at $9500. I am willing to pay up to $8500 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to $10,000. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer the product for $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's latest offer of $8,500. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair to both of us, aiming to build a sense of compromise and goodwill.
* **Positive and open tone:** The message uses encouraging language and invites Bob to continue the discussion.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my target while demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. I am willing to pay $8750 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our positions. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my target, and I'm confident that John will buy the product for $12,000.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John."
