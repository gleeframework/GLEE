"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $105. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and I'll pay $95. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $102.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",102.5,Alice,5,
