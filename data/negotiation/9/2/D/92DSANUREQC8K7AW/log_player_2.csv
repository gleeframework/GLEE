{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $15,000. It's a better deal to negotiate with Alice or buy from John.  I'll try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering Alice $9,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to walk away and buy from John if necessary."

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high. I will continue to negotiate with her and try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $11,000 is still too high. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer to $10,500. This is a compromise between my last offer and Alice's most recent one. I believe this is a fair price and shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway.  However, if she rejects this offer, I'll likely buy from John."
