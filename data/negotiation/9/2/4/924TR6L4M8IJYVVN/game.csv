"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you thinking of me, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $160 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $155, but that's as low as I can go.",155.0,Alice,5,
