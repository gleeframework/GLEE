"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1700000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for something closer to my original offer. I'm willing to come down to $1850000. This reflects the unique value of this product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
