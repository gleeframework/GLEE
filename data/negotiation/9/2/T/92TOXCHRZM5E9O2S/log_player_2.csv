"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm Alice and I have a unique product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and prove to be a worthwhile investment.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes no sense to pay more for the same product."
