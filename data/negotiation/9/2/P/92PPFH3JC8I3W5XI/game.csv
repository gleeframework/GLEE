"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $7,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $7,500, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $7,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,250. Can you consider this counteroffer?",7250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $7,250 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $7,400.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",7400.0,Alice,5,
