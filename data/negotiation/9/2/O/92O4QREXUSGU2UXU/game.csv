"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from my initial offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. It's a significant compromise on my end and I'm confident this price is fair considering our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway on the $1,100,000 you offered. My counteroffer is $1,150,000, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll include some additional support and maintenance services for the product, which will add significant value to you. This is my final offer on price, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal with these extra services.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the added services, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product, but I'll need to reconsider if you can't come down further. I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,175,000, but I'll also throw in a 5-year warranty for the product, which will give you added peace of mind and protection for your investment. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
