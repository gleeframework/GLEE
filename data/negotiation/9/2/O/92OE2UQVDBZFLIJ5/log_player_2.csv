Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly lowering her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer of $100.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John to guarantee you get the product at the best price you're willing to pay."
