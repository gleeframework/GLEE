"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential opportunity for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* I'll use the threat of selling to John as a bargaining chip if necessary. 
* I'll analyze Bob's responses and adjust my counteroffers strategically in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is capped at $800000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **Threat of John:** The potential sale to John for $1,000,000 provides a strong bargaining position in subsequent rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price closer to my target, but still above Bob's offer. 
* I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and the possibility of selling to John if necessary."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to be fair, but that's my final offer.  I have another buyer ready to purchase it at that price, so you'll need to act quickly if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm setting a clear price that reflects my minimum while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I reiterate the product's worth to strengthen my position.
* **Threat of John:**  The mention of John's offer creates urgency and pressure on Bob to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

* **Target price:** My goal is to reach $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Maintaining control:**  I'm not conceding too much, but I'm also showing flexibility to avoid a stalemate.
* **Negotiating to the end:**  I'm prepared to continue negotiating until the final round if necessary."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and am willing to go up to $850000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product while staying within my constraints.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

* **The threat of John is still strong:** The potential sale to John for $1,000,000 puts me in a strong bargaining position.

* **Focus on value and John's offer:** I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and the possibility of selling to John if necessary.
