"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is capped at $800000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to be fair, but that's my final offer.  I have another buyer ready to purchase it at that price, so you'll need to act quickly if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and am willing to go up to $850000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product while staying within my constraints.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $850000 is still a significant difference from what this product is truly worth.  I'm prepared to make one final concession to  $950000.  However, if you're not willing to meet me halfway, I have another buyer ready to purchase it immediately at $1000000.  It's your decision, but I suggest acting quickly to avoid missing out on this unique opportunity.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000.  Let's split the difference -  I'll offer you $900000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and shows my strong interest in your product.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 still doesn't fully reflect the value of this product.  I'm committed to reaching a fair deal, but  I'm only willing to go down to $925000.  This is my final offer.  Keep in mind, I have another buyer waiting to purchase this immediately at $1000000.  Time is running out, so let me know if you're ready to finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
