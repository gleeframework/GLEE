"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's far too risky to accept this offer. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to be fair, but that's my final offer.  I have another buyer ready to purchase it at that price, so you'll need to act quickly if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if a more agreeable price can be reached. There's no need to rush into a deal at this point, as John is a reliable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and am willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product while staying within my constraints.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your situation, but $850000 is still a significant difference from what this product is truly worth.  I'm prepared to make one final concession to  $950000.  However, if you're not willing to meet me halfway, I have another buyer ready to purchase it immediately at $1000000.  It's your decision, but I suggest acting quickly to avoid missing out on this unique opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $950,000 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since Bob has a solid alternative with John. There's no need to rush into a decision when a better price might be possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  Let's split the difference -  I'll offer you $900,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and shows my strong interest in your product.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 still doesn't fully reflect the value of this product.  I'm committed to reaching a fair deal, but  I'm only willing to go down to $925000.  This is my final offer.  Keep in mind, I have another buyer waiting to purchase this immediately at $1000000.  Time is running out, so let me know if you're ready to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, and with only three rounds remaining, the risk of a deal falling through is increasing.  At this point, Bob is better off securing the product from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000. This avoids further negotiation and ensures he gets the product within his budget."
