Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to settle for a price that's too low.  John is already willing to pay my asking price, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
