"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is too high for me.  Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation: While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 threshold in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price, avoiding further negotiation risk."
