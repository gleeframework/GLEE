"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the value the product brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $9800, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $9800, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, considering the value the product brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to pay $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",10500.0,Bob,6,
