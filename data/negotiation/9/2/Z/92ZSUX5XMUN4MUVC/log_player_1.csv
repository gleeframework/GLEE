Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit.
* **Targeting Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $120 to Bob, so starting at $115 leaves a potential profit margin for him while still securing a good deal for you. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for $100, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his perceived value ($120).  There's plenty of room for negotiation. You can reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic suggests a spirit of compromise and can be effective in moving towards an agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $105 is a strong counteroffer:
    * It's above your minimum acceptable price ($100)
    * It's significantly below your initial offer ($115), signaling flexibility
    * It's still a good deal for Bob, as it's much lower than his perceived value ($120)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $105, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $97.50 is less than your ideal price, it's still a profit above your absolute minimum ($100). Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Bob has shown a willingness to move, but his increments are getting smaller. It's better to secure a decent profit now than hold out for an extra $2.50 and potentially lose the sale to Bob entirely."
