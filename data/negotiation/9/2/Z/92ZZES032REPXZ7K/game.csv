"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit above $9,750. I can do $10,200. That's as low as I can go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.",10200.0,Alice,5,
