"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems great, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,250. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,5,
