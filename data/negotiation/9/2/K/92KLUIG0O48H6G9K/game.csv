"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this counteroffer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could reach an agreement that suits both of us better. I propose $11,000 as a counteroffer. This price acknowledges the value of your product while staying within my financial limits. I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
