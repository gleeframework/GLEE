"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for less than its worth to you, and I get a fair price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $820,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further from my initial offer - how about $900,000?  This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $870,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",870000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product.  $870,000 is getting closer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $885,000?  This gives you a good deal, and I can finally move forward with this sale.",885000.0,Alice,5,
