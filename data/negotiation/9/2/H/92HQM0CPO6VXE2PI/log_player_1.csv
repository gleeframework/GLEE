Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's highly valuable, but I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price higher than $100 gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also tests his willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and emphasizes the perceived value of the product. 
 
**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always propose a lower price, moving closer to your minimum acceptable price of $100."
