"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this valuable product for $15,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 7000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000), I'm aiming to establish a negotiation range that benefits me. Even if Alice rejects this outright, it provides a basis for moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm aware that $7,000 is a long way from Alice's asking price. However, this initial counteroffer leaves ample room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I have the security of John's offer ($10,000) in my back pocket.  This gives me a strong fallback position and prevents me from feeling pressured to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $12,000 is still above both my budget and John's offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** My counteroffer of $9,000 acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This offer essentially splits the difference between her current offer ($12,000) and my previous counteroffer ($7,000). It demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach a deal. 
* **John's Offer as a Benchmark:** I'm still mindful that I can buy the product from John for $10,000. I'm hoping to secure a deal below that price, but it serves as a mental limit for how high I'm willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is a fair price for this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $11,000, and while that's close to my budget, it's still higher than John's guaranteed offer of $10,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are minimal compared to the risk of her walking away.  It's more advantageous to secure the product from John at the known price."
