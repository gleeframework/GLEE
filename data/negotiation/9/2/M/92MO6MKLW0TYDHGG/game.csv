"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is a fair price for this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
