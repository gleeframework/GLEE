"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $1,300,000 to make this worth it. Let's split the difference and go with that figure. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but I'm still committed to getting at least $1,300,000 for this product.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle at $1,287,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
