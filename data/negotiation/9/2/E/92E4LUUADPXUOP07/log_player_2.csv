# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so you can aim for a price closer to that.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

While $1,100,000 is better than John's offer, it's still not as good as the price I'm aiming for. I know Alice's bottom line is $800,000, so there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting her offer keeps the conversation open and gives me a chance to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000, and it's within my desired range.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price. It's time to accept the offer and secure the purchase."
