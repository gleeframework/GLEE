"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $750,000, which is a $100,000 discount from my initial offer. Is this more in line with what you're looking for?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I can see that you're getting close to a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet you at $775,000.  My absolute limit is $740,000.  If you're willing to reconsider, I'm ready to close the deal.",740000.0,Bob,6,
