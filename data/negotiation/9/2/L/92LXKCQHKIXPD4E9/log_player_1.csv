Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy at play:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and future potential.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($2,250,000) than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob view any subsequent negotiation as a ""deal"" even if it's above his initial valuation. 
* **Justification:** V vaguely mentioning ""unique opportunity"" and ""future potential"" aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing specifics. This vagueness can sometimes justify a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more in control.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If Bob is very risk-averse, a very high initial offer might scare him off entirely. You'll need to gauge this beforehand if possible.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive opening might be preferable. 
* **Information:** This strategy assumes you have limited information about Bob's negotiation style and financial situation.

**Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000, giving you leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price you find acceptable."
