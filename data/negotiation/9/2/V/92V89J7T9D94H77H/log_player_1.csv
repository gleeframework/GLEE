Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking that $1,200,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go higher than that. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $1,200,000 and unwilling to budge.  There's no indication further negotiation will change his mind. Accepting his offer would mean missing out on potential profit. Since John offers the same amount as Bob's final offer, it's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
