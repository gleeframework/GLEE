Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a price above Bob's value:** Since I know Bob values the product at $120, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. Offering it slightly above his perceived value might work, especially if he's eager to secure the product.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that I believe it's worth at least $120, I'm anchoring his perception of the value. Offering a ""discount"" from a higher starting point can sometimes be more appealing. 
* **Backup plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing anything because I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120."
