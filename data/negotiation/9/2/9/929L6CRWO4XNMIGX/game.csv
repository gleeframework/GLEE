"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $900,000? That feels more reasonable to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a fair price, I need to ensure I get a return that reflects the value of the product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This allows us both to find a happy middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I'm serious about purchasing the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
