"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to counter any offers he makes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise,  halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, it will be enough to sway Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $95 is a good offer, I'm going to reject it and see if I can push Bob higher. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $105. This is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to see if I can push for a little bit more. We have several rounds left and I'm confident we can close the deal for a price that's fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is a more aggressive move than my previous offer, but Bob has consistently been willing to negotiate. I believe he will accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would like to get more than $80 for the product, Bob's counteroffer of $85 is not worth risking.  I only have two rounds left to negotiate and I don't think I can convince him to go higher.  Selling to John at this point is the best option to ensure I get something for the product."
