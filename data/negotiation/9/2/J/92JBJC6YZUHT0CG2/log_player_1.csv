Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to haggle, but still ensures a significant profit above my minimum. 
* **Time Value & Certainty:** While I could try for an even higher price, Bob might reject it. Selling to John guarantees $10,000, but securing a deal with Bob quickly is preferable."
