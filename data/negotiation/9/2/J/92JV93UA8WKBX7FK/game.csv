"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value and condition. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $9,500 for it. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000 is the absolute max I can afford. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
