"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target as possible. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, considering its value to you is $800000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to me is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
