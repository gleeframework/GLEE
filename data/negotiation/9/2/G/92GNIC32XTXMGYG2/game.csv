"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, valued at over a million dollars to me.  I believe it holds significant potential for you as well. My initial offer is $1500000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1350000 is still below what I believe the product's true value to be. I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1325000. Can we meet at this price?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and we're getting closer.  However, $1325000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1375000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that's mutually beneficial.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $1375000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1325000 again. However, I'm willing to throw in an additional $10000 to sweeten the deal, so my new offer is $1335000. Can we meet at this price?",1335000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, $1335000 is still below my target. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.  I'm proposing $1355000 as a final compromise.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1355000.0,Alice,7,
