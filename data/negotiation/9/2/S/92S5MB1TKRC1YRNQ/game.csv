"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still leave plenty of room for you to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to make a deal, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet halfway on our last offers. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This gives you a great price and allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to go up slightly. How about $960,000? That's a fair compromise.",960000.0,Bob,6,
