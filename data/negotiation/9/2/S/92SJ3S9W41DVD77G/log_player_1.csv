Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $170 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try and get a higher price from Bob. $140 is still below my minimum, and I have a guaranteed $150 from John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $155? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $145 is closer to my minimum, I'm still within range of a better deal with Bob. I also have the security of John's offer, so I can afford to be a bit more stubborn."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to do the same. How about we split the difference again? $150 seems like a fair price to me.  Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $142.50, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to my minimum price, but Bob is still a bit below it. I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear we're not going to come to an agreement.  I'm going to sell to John for $150. It's guaranteed, and it's a better deal than what Bob is offering."
