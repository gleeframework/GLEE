"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $95 from Alice, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still only $2 away from your target price, and there's no reason to assume Alice won't budge. You can try a counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's better to accept the offer. You've already successfully negotiated a lower price, and further negotiation may not result in a significant difference. You're now only $3 below your target price, which is a good outcome.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling through and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
