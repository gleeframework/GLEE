**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very reluctant to go beyond a certain point.  At this stage, the difference between his potential offer and John's guaranteed offer is significant enough that it's no longer worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Accepting John's offer guarantees the maximum value and eliminates the uncertainty of further haggling with Bob."
