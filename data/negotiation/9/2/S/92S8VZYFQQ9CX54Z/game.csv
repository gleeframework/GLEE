"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the substantial benefits you'll gain from it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
