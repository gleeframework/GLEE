"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm confident that this price will be mutually beneficial. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $950,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant amount of money, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
