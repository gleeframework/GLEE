"I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm confident that this price will be mutually beneficial. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
