Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  This price demonstrates you understand the product's worth while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his own valuation. 

**Important:** This is a single-round offer in the provided scenario. In real-world negotiations, multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers are common."
