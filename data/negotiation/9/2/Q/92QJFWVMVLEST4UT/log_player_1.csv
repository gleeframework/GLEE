"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still reasonable. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$70 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm lowering my price slightly to try and reach a compromise with Bob.  I'm still above my minimum, but I want to signal my willingness to negotiate."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I think I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price again to try and encourage Bob to make a final offer closer to my desired price.  We're running out of rounds, so I need to be more flexible."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the likelihood of Bob agreeing to a price closer to my minimum is low.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
