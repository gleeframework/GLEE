"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $90 is probably too low. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a pretty good offer considering John is offering it for $100.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your negotiation, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $100, which is a fair price considering what John is offering.  Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
