"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I want to anchor the negotiation high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential benefits for Bob, fostering a collaborative tone for the negotiation. 
* **""Opening offer"" language:**  Using phrases like ""proposing"" and ""to start the conversation"" signals that this is just the beginning of the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I've done my research and believe a fair price for this product is closer to $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to steer the price closer to my target range. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to counter with a more favorable proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price of $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product and the unique benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise while still recognizing the significant value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and appreciate:** Showing respect for Bob's offer helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Hold firm (for now):** While I'm lowering my price, the decrease is relatively small, signaling that I'm not desperate to close at any price.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique benefits to justify the higher price tag and shift Bob's focus away from his initial valuation.
* **""Compromise"" language:** By framing the new price as a ""compromise,"" I'm subtly encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your return, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and allows us both to walk away happy.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might walk away or I might leave money on the table. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially jeopardizing the sale."
