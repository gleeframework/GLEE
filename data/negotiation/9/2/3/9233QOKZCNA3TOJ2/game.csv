"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and my minimum selling price. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum and aligns with the value I place on the product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
