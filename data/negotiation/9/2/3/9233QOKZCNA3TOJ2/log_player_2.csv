Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and my minimum selling price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above what you'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation. You can try to counteroffer again to see if you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and it's still a great value for you. I'm confident you'll find it worth it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above your desired price point and you've already made several counteroffers. Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and uncertain. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it's more efficient to purchase from John and avoid further negotiation."
