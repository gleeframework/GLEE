"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, you can potentially get it for less.  You're willing to pay $15,000, but there's room to negotiate with Alice or see if John will come down slightly."
