Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Going too high (close to $12,000) might make Bob feel like you're trying to take advantage of his valuation.  This could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a little, selling at $11,500 is still a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000."
