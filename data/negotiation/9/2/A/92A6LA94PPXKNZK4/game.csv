"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I know it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $1,200,000. This gives you a significant advantage and allows me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
