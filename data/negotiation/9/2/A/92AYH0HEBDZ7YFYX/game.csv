"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for your product. This is my best offer, as I have other options available.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
