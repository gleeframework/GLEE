"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and my current financial constraints. I'm confident we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my bottom line. I'm willing to move down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would allow us both to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
