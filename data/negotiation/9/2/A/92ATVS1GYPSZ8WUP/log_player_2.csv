Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth less than $200, and I'm willing to pay a bit more than $100, but not $200. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $200 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $170? That's a fair compromise.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get as close to $100 as possible. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $170 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
