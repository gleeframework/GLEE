Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get to a price that works for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but she's also holding firm to a price above $800,000.  At this point, the difference between her offer of $825,000 and John's offer of $1,000,000 is significant enough to warrant accepting Alice's deal."
