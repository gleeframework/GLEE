Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
