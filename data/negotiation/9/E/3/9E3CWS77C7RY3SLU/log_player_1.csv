"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $8200 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target of $9,500.  It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is still a great value considering the product's worth.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to pay more than $8600 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,600 is only $400 away from my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,500, I've already gone through several rounds and I'm nearing the halfway point.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm likely to get a better offer from John if I continue rejecting Bob's proposals.  It's better to close the deal and move on."
