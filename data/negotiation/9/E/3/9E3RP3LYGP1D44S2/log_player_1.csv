Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible, maximizing her profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Above Alice's Minimum:** The offer is still comfortably above Alice's $100 minimum, ensuring she makes a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having a safe fallback option with John."
