Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's really eager.  
* **Above Minimum:** This price is comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring you make a good profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
