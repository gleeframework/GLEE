"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value, $1500000 is a bit above my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I have 9 more rounds to potentially negotiate a better price with Bob. Selling to John right now would mean leaving $200,000 on the table, so it's not the best option. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering its unique potential. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. It's a good compromise, and I believe it shows I'm serious about acquiring this product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Selling to John right now would be a better option than accepting this offer. I have 6 more rounds to try and negotiate a better price with Bob, and I believe I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and it's still a great value for the unique product I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably commit to at this time. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000.  This price is fair considering our previous discussions, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. However, I'm getting closer to my goal. We have 4 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,275,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential. Let's come together and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1290000}
