"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value, $1500000 is a bit above my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. It's a fair price considering its unique potential. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. It's a good compromise, and I believe it shows I'm serious about acquiring this product. Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and it's still a great value for the unique product I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably commit to at this time. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000.  This price is fair considering our previous discussions, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1275000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1290000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential. Let's come together and make this deal happen.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
