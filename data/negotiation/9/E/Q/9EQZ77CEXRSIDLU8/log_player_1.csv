{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.  

By offering $1,000,000, you're:

* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** This demonstrates that you're not simply looking to maximize profit at any cost.
* **Positioning yourself strategically:**  This price point is likely appealing to Bob, as it's lower than the product's value to him.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a higher price for you.

Remember, you can always choose to accept a lower offer or counteroffer, or sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations don't go in your favor."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your target. You have a strong negotiating position because you have another buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to potentially increase the price further through counteroffers."

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than your target. You're in a good position because you have another buyer (John) who's willing to pay your minimum price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can potentially increase the price further through counteroffers.  You're also demonstrating that you're not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than your initial offer, which could encourage Bob to offer a higher price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations with Bob have reached a point where it's clear that he's not willing to meet your minimum acceptable price.  You've been steadily lowering your price, but Bob has been offering less and less with each round.  At this point, you're risking further negotiation with Bob will only result in a lower price, and you're already below your target. 

Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
