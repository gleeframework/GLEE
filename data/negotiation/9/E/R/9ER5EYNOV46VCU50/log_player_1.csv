Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $5,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers you [mention a key benefit Bob would find valuable] and more. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $18,000 is still too steep for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $7,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,000 is too low.  Would you consider $15,000?  That's a firm offer, as I already have another buyer at that price."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While I know you have another buyer, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob is unlikely to go beyond his $8,000 limit. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
