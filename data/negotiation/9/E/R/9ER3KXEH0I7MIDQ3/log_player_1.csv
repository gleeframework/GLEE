Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $145."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 (your guaranteed sale price to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $145 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. It's unlikely Bob would find a better deal elsewhere.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial constraints beyond his product valuation."
