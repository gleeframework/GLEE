"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come out ahead. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,250,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your concerns, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
