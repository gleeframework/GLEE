You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is cheaper than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You value the product at $150, and Alice values it at $120, so there's room for a mutually beneficial price."
