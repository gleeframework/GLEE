"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we discuss a price of $750,000? I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest,  $750,000 is significantly below the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle on $850,000? This price still allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
