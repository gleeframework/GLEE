Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the potential value for Bob, I'm attempting to anchor his perception of the product's worth at a higher point.  

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate and will need to consider Bob's response, the risk of him walking away, and the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering me first. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a decent offer, it's still less than my desired minimum of $15,000. I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests he's genuinely interested, and his counter-offer isn't drastically far off.  I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value."", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $17,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's potential value to Bob, subtly reminding him of its benefits.

This counteroffer keeps me above my minimum while still aiming for a deal with Bob. It's a balance between maximizing profit and avoiding a stalemate that might push me to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's message indicates he's firm on his $14,000 offer.  He's explicitly stated that this is his limit.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer of $15,000 guarantees me a profit above my minimum and avoids further negotiation. 

While I might be able to push Bob slightly higher, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of him walking away. John's offer provides a safe and acceptable outcome."
