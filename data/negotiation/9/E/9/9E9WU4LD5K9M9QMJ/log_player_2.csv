"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for the product. What's the best you can do?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price.  While $8,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the benefits it provides and the return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice is still very far from your ideal price point. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

We're now at Bob's maximum budget. This offer lets Alice know Bob's serious but also sets a firm limit. If she doesn't budge, buying from John is the best option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but $10,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need to make this worthwhile. I can be flexible, but I need to get at least $14,000 for it.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is moving closer to your price range, but there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal. You're willing to walk away at $10,000, so it's worth pushing her a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $12,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and your budget. It shows you're still interested in the deal while trying to secure a final discount."
