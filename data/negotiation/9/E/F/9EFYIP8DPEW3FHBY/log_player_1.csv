"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $120 to Bob. I believe there's room for negotiation, but I want to start high to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first offer.  I believe I can still get a higher price through negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it.  While I would have preferred my initial asking price, getting $125 is a fair price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
