"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
