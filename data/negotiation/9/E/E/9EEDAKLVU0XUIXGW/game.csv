"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $115 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $105, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $97.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
