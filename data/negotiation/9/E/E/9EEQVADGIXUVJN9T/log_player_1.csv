I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value. I hope this will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell for $14,000. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach an agreement."

I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is just above my minimum value, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I don't lose any more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum value.  I've already made several counteroffers, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  At this point, it's better to sell to John for $15,000 and ensure I don't lose any more money."
