"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $105. Would you be willing to consider that?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go to $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $102.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that point?",102.5,Alice,5,
