"Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate your offer, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's still a great deal for a product like this.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but unfortunately, $110 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $135. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,5,
