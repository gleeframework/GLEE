Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,000,000 or more. I'm willing to part with it for $1,950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer waiting."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,950,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This can make Bob more receptive to a slightly lower counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Potential Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob (""worth $1,000,000 or more"") aims to justify the high asking price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is based on limited information. In a real negotiation, understanding Bob's personality, negotiation style, and your own risk tolerance would be crucial for fine-tuning your approach. 
* There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. However, having John as a guaranteed backup ensures you'll still secure your minimum price."
