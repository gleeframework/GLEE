"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in seeing what a counteroffer might get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's roughly 2/3 of Alice's initial offer. This shows a strong intent to negotiate and gives Alice room to counter without feeling overly pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $65 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hesitant to accept. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to budge a bit more, especially since I've already shown a willingness to negotiate.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my ideal. $60 is a good midpoint between Alice's latest offer and my previous counteroffer. This should encourage Alice to seriously consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $68 is close enough to my target price of $60, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. It's risky to keep pushing for a lower price since we might not have enough time to close the deal. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, leaving room for a potential profit if I resell it."
