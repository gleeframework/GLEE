"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Can you consider $115?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob! I'm glad to hear that you're interested in making a decision soon. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle, so I'll consider $112.50. This is my best offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",112.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a good negotiation. However, I've already made a significant concession, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50, but I don't think I can go any lower than that. This is my last offer.",107.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $107.50, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $105, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150. This is my last offer.",105.0,Bob,10,
