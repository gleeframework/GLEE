"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the value it holds while still offering you a good deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
