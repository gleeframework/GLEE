"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000 for your product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1800000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm happy to come down to $1900000, which reflects the value of this unique product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1850000 for your product. This is my best offer within my budget.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your budget, $1850000 still doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1875000? This allows us both to secure a fair deal, and it's a good starting point for a final agreement.",1875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway. My final offer for your product is $1860000. I hope this aligns better with our negotiations.",1860000.0,Bob,6,
