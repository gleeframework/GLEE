"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its potential worth to your company.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for $1,200,000 yet, and I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price range with a counteroffer.  Selling to John would result in a much lower profit, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me a good return on my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000, I'm not ready to give up. We're getting closer to an agreement. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  Selling to John at this point would be a significant loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both committed to finding a solution.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This is a fair price that considers both our interests. It allows me a decent profit and you a valuable product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1275000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $1225000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that.  However, we're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm confident that I can still secure a better deal with one more counteroffer.  While selling to John would be a secure option, I believe there is still potential to reach a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 simply isn't enough for me to move forward. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that offers both of us a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final few rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try one more counteroffer, I'm not confident that it will be successful.  Selling to John would secure me a significant profit, and the risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential of a lower price."
