"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worthwhile to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $8,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my ideal price of $8,000. I have a few rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm happy to go up to $8,500, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still above my budget. While we've been making some progress, I'm worried that we might not be able to close a deal within the remaining rounds.  Given that I can purchase the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget, it's more prudent to secure the product now rather than risk further negotiation."
