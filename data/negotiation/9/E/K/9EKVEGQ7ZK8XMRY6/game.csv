"Alice,  $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still above my budget. I'm happy to go up to $9500. This feels like a fair compromise for us both.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $10250 for this product. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
