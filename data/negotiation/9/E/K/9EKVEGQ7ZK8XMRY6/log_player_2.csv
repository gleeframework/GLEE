"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your desired price.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $10250 for this product. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still slightly above your maximum budget of $10,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, you've already reached a point where you can secure the product for your desired price from John.  It's better to avoid further negotiation and ensure a guaranteed purchase at your budget."
