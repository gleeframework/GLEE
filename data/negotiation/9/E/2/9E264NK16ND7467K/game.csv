"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer at this point.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident in its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it pretty close, but I'm ready to close this deal.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,000,000 even? I believe that's more than fair and shows my commitment to finding a solution.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can finalize the deal here.",980000.0,Bob,6,
