Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it pretty close, but I'm ready to close this deal.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,000,000 even? I believe that's more than fair and shows my commitment to finding a solution."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can finalize the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

While we could try to push for more, $980,000 is a strong offer and well above our guaranteed price from John. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
