Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and hopefully maximizes my potential profit. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's agreeable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate. John's offer of $1,200,000 is my guaranteed floor, so I'm not pressured to accept anything lower than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering again with $1,300,000. This is a small decrease from my previous offer, signaling that I'm willing to be flexible but still want to secure a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd still prefer a higher price, $1,280,000 is a good compromise and significantly higher than John's offer.  It's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher, and I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely."
