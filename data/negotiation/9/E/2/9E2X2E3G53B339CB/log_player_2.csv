"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his maximum price of $15,000 and Alice's minimum price of $10,000. This counteroffer offers a price that's $1,500 lower than Alice's offer, giving Alice some room to negotiate but still providing a significant savings for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This takes into account your needs and my need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good price for Bob.  It's still less than the $15,000 he'd pay from John, and it's within his budget. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice as it saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John."
