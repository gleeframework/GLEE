Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't know his upper limit. Starting with a higher offer allows us to gauge his interest and potentially maximize our profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $120 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate. If he counters, we can always come down, potentially settling on a price higher than $80.
* **Backup Option:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80. This provides a safety net, allowing us to be bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
