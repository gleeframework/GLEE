"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise further, though. I can offer it to you for $820,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",820000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
