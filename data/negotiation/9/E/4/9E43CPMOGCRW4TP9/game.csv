"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant at $125. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That seems like a fair compromise.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $112.50. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $122.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",122.5,Alice,5,
