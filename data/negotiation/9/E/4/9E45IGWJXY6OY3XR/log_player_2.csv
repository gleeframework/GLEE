"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $10,000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and your investment. Considering the market value and the benefits it offers, I suggest we aim for a price closer to $9,500. This allows us to strike a balance that could be mutually beneficial. Let's schedule a call to further discuss this opportunity and ensure it meets your expectations. Looking forward to your response.
