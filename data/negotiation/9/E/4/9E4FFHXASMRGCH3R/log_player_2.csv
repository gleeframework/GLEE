"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$600,000 is a good price, but there's potential to save more.** It's always beneficial to explore the possibility of a lower price, especially in the first round. 
* **There's no harm in rejecting and making a counteroffer.**  This allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $100,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is significant but not unreasonable. It shows Bob is serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will give Bob a good understanding of Alice's flexibility and potential bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer:** The $550,000 offer is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Time is a factor:** With only 7 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers. 
* **Potential to save more, but not guaranteed:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge more. Accepting ensures a good price and a deal."
