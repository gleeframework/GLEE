{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more than that to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a fair starting point as it's a good middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's perceived value.  It also gives me some room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
