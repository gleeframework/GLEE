"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your goal is to save money.** While $14,000 is close to your limit, you can save $1,000 by buying from John. 
* **You have a fallback option.** John guarantees you can get the product for $15,000 if you need it.
* **Alice might negotiate.** By rejecting her first offer, there's a chance she'll come back with a lower price closer to her $10,000 valuation."
