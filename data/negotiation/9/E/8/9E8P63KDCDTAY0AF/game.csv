"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident this product holds more value than $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  It's a fair compromise, considering the product's true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
