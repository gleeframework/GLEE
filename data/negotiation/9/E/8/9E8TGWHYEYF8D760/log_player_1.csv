{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances getting a good price with leaving room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, but worth $120 to Bob, I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my value but still within his budget.  This gives Bob an opportunity to counteroffer if he feels the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than his initial value of $120, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'll try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a little bit.  How about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's counteroffer of $125 is too far below my minimum threshold of $150.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's a better decision for me to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
