"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $120? This would be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Can you consider that?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $118? This way, we both get a fair price and I can move closer to my goal.",118.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $118. I'm willing to pay $112 for it. Can you consider that?,112.0,Bob,6,
