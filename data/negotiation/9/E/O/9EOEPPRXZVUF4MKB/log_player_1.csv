Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest in selling me the product, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This seems to be closer to the midpoint between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
This is a good point to accept the offer. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and $100 is a good profit margin above your minimum price.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
