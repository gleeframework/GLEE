Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  I believe it holds significant value and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to start by aiming higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Creating a Sense of Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other potential buyers, you subtly create a sense of urgency and value. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will reject this initial offer. However, it gives you the best chance to maximize your profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always negotiate down or proceed with selling to John at your guaranteed price."
