"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to you is $8,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While the product is worth $8,000 to him, Alice's offer of $9,500 is still too high. He has a better option with John, who is selling the same product for $8,000. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but it's unlikely she will go lower than $9,500, given the product's worth to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I would like to respectfully suggest a price closer to my initial offer, which was based on the value I place on the product. I am willing to consider $9,000 as a compromise, which still allows for a reasonable profit margin for me while acknowledging your valuation of the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is still too high for Bob. He can continue negotiating, but there's no guarantee that Alice will go lower, especially since she's already compromised. Given that John is selling the product for $8,000, Bob should choose the sure thing and buy from John. This saves him money and avoids further negotiation."
