# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

You should reject Alice's offer.  Even though it's a good deal compared to what the product is worth to Alice, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
