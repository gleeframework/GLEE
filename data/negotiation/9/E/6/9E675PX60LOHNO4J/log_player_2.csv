"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's potential to save money by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While continuing to negotiate might yield a lower price, there's no guarantee.  Bob is better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
