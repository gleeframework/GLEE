Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $16,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we try $12,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you say $14,000 is your final offer, but I have a final offer of my own to make. Considering your need to sell and my budget, I think $12,500 is a reasonable final price. If you don't agree, I will have to consider going with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing a tough negotiating game, and it's unlikely he'll move much higher than $12,500. While you might be able to squeeze a bit more out of him in subsequent rounds, the difference is unlikely to be significant enough to warrant risking the guaranteed $15,000 from John. 

At this point, accepting John's offer ensures you get a price that meets your minimum and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
