"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully secures a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my ideal goal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to secure a better price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This might incentivize Bob to accept, as he's likely to value the product higher than this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum goal of $800,000, Bob's offer is still below my ideal price. I'm going to continue negotiating and hope to secure a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000 again.  We seem to be stuck at this point, and this is the most likely price Bob will accept.  He's already rejected this price once, so I'm hoping he'll see the value in reaching an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to $950,000.  The deal with John is always a backup option, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000.  I'm trying to split the difference with Bob, and I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable compromise.  If he rejects this offer, I might have to reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I have two rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to secure a final deal that's closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  We are running out of time, and this is likely the highest offer Bob will accept.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in reaching an agreement now, rather than risking losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is the final round, and Bob's offer is lower than my minimum goal.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I need to secure a sale that meets my minimum financial requirement. Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $800,000."
