"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it hard to find a better deal anywhere else.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that price point be feasible for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it hard to find a better deal anywhere else.",10200.0,Alice,5,
