"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's interested in the product at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This should hopefully encourage Bob to come closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $128 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I still have time and a backup buyer, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price for yourself, but $128 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair price that would make us both happy. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground here, and $135 is a compromise between our last offers. It's a good way to demonstrate my flexibility and hopefully convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure $135 is the best price for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge much further, and I'm only a few rounds away from potentially losing the deal entirely. Selling to John at $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than risking a lower sale or losing out altogether."
