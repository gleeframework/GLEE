Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This gives us room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit. This should encourage Bob to continue negotiating, and I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort. I'm better off selling to John and guaranteeing the minimum value I'm looking for."
