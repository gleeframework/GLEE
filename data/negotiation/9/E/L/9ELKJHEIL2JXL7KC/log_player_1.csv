Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your ""walk-away"" price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** Offering it at $1,500,000 (your minimum) or higher is likely to be an immediate turn-off for Bob, as he only values it at $1,200,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,400,000 offer signals that you're willing to negotiate but also value the product highly. This approach aims to find a mutually beneficial agreement within a reasonable timeframe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value, leaving no room for negotiation.  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. However, it's worth trying to negotiate a bit further with Bob before taking the guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession, But Above Bob's Value:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's stated value.
* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:**  It encourages Bob to reveal if he's willing to move from his initial offer.  If he doesn't budge, we can confidently accept John's offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We avoid drastically dropping to John's price ($1,500,000), signaling we're not desperate and believe in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,350,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer, limiting further negotiation.
* **Minimal Potential Gain:** While we could try to negotiate a bit higher than $1,250,000, Bob's firm stance suggests the potential gains would be small.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of prolonged, potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob. 

At this point, the certainty and higher profit margin with John outweigh the potential for a slightly better deal with Bob."
