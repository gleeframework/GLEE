"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10500?  That gives us both a fair price.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above $10000. How about we meet at $9800? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're serious about $9800.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not that much.  How about $10200?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $10200, so how about $10100? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",10100.0,Bob,6,
