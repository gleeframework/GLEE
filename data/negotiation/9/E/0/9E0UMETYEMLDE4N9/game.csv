"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $16,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $15,500?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $16,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
