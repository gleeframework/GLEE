"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,500,000. This acknowledges the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I hope you'll consider this final offer before I have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
