,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about finding a solution.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
