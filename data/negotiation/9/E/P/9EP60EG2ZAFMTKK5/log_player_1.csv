Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing fairness and value to Bob, encouraging him to see it as a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By starting at $1,400,000, I'm creating space for potential counteroffers and negotiations without immediately hitting my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've successfully sold the product for a good price. 
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll evaluate his counteroffer and respond accordingly. If he's too low, I'll counter or potentially move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is good, but the price is a little steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000 and also well below the value I know Bob places on the product. 
* **Negotiation is Necessary:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean a huge loss for me. I need to continue negotiating to see if I can reach a more acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial $1,400,000, but still staying above my minimum and closer to my desired price point.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making the offer seem even more appealing.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to further discussion, allowing for a potential back-and-forth to reach a final agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! We've reached a good deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about $950,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Losing Opportunity:**  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my value.  There's a chance that if I keep negotiating, Bob might come closer to my price, but there's also a chance he'll walk away. 
* **John is a Safe Bet:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, which is a much safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll proceed to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures that I get the best possible price and avoids further risks with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about finding a solution.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Stand:** This is likely my final counteroffer before considering John's offer.
* **Significant Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating that $1,100,000 is still a great deal for him, considering the product's worth.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning ""making this deal happen,"" hoping to push Bob towards accepting. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Fantastic! We've reached a mutually agreeable price.
* **Bob Rejects:**  Time to move on to John and secure my minimum price. I've done what I can to negotiate with Bob, but the risk of not getting a good deal is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still $450,000 below my ideal price and $400,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** It's become clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further. Continued negotiation is risky and time-consuming. 
* **Safeguarding My Interests:**  John's offer guarantees my minimum, and that's a much safer bet than continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially considering how close we are to John's price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000.  This ensures that I get the best possible price and avoids further potential delays and risks."
