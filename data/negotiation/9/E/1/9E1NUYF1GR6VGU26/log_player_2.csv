"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance he can get closer to his ideal price without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal. By offering $700,000, Bob is aiming to get Alice to come down significantly from her original price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer and within Bob's budget.  It's unlikely Bob will be able to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, especially considering he can buy the product for $1,500,000 from John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible option at this point."
