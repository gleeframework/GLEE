"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

You should reject Alice's offer. It's still above your maximum budget of $80. You can try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to your target price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before buying from John."
