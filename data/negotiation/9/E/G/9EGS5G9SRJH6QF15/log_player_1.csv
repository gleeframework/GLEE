"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price than my minimum of $800,000. I'm also trying to understand Bob's perceived value of the product and see if he's willing to play in the same ballpark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range. I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob, so there's time to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $900,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still within my minimum acceptable range. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a good compromise and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal. While I would have preferred a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on this sale and potentially needing to sell to John for the same amount.  I've managed to secure a deal within my desired range, and it's important to know when to cut my losses and take a good deal."
