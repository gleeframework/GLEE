Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before it hits the open market. I think it would be very valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it for $11,000."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), there's an opportunity to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $11,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $3,000 less than its perceived value to him.
    * I make $1,000 more than I would by selling to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he desires, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price."
