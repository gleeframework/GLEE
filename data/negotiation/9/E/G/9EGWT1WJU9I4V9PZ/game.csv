"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're open to that, we have a deal. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
