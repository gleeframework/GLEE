"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $150. It's a great deal, and it's worth at least that much to you. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll be selling it to someone else.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $150, and John is selling it for $150. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer, as you can get the same product at the same price from John."
