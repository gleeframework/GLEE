"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $180.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still aiming for a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to lower the price if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $150. While it's higher than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm countering with $170. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this price will be attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $145. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm not ready to settle for that price yet, and I'm going to try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm countering with $160. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob, given our back and forth. It's still a good profit for me and might be the sweet spot to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $140. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to try to counteroffer one more time before seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm countering with $150. This is my final offer before considering selling to John. It's a good compromise, giving Bob a better price while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, but Bob's last offer of $135 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  With only three rounds left, it's getting risky to keep pushing for a higher price.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $120 to guarantee a sale.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's better than risking a failed negotiation with Bob and ending up with nothing."
