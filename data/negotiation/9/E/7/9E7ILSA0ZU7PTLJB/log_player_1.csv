"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a good middle ground.
* **Friendly approach:** My message is friendly and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. I highlight the potential value of the product for Bob to pique his interest.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going for the full $120 right away, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:** While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to my desired price with another round of counteroffers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $80 would be a safe option, but it limits my potential profit. I'm willing to take a chance on getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway. It's a $5 increase from his offer, but still significantly lower than my original offer of $100.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a clear reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing a ""good deal"" for both of us.
* **Continuing the negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, giving Bob another chance to accept or counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away entirely or the deal falling apart.
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's prudent to secure a deal close to my minimum. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
