"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the substantial value this product brings, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
