Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** I'm aiming for more than the guaranteed $12,000 from John.
* **It's not too high:**  I don't want to scare Bob off immediately, so I'm not starting at a ridiculously high price.

The next step is to see if Bob accepts or rejects the offer.  If he rejects, I'll know I need to lower the price to make it more attractive to him. But for now, I'm taking a calculated risk and hoping for the best!"
