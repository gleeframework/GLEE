"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, I'm hoping to get this product for closer to $1,100,000.  That would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to move forward then.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
