Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) and slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100). 
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value ($150).**  
* **There is still room for negotiation.**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still a gap between his offer and my minimum. I can counteroffer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet.**  While John will pay my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my value.
