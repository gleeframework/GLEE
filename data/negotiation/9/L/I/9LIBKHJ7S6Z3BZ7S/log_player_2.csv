{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($110) is within your budget of $120.** 
* **You're saving $10 compared to buying from John.** 
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, it's likely she's already offering a price close to her minimum. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option."
