"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is too low for me to consider. Could you do $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering I'm paying more than John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
At this point, Bob is offering more than John ($11,500 vs. $12,000). Accepting the offer maximizes profit.
