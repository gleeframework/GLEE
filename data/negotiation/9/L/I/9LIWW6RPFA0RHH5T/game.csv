"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering I'm paying more than John's offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
