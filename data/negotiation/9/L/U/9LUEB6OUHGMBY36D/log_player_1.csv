Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. This represents a significant saving for you compared to your initial offer, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a sure win.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
