"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit less than the value to Bob, hoping to start the negotiation in a positive way.  I also want to leave some room for negotiation in case he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept Bob's offer right away. He's clearly trying to push for a lower price, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more though. How about $95?  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.5 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept it. I want to try and get a bit more and see if Bob is truly interested in this product. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $87.50 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $91.25? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 91.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $91.25. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$90 is a good price, considering Bob's initial offer of $80.  It's important to keep in mind that we only have 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting this offer will ensure I get a decent price for the product."
