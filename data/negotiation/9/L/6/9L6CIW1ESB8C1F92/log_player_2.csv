"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering and negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's price, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This will likely prompt Alice to counter back, allowing for a more favorable negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal. It's slightly above my maximum budget, but I'm willing to accept it considering the risk of further negotiation.  It's likely that I won't get a better offer from Alice, and continuing the negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away from the deal.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price that's within my acceptable range."
