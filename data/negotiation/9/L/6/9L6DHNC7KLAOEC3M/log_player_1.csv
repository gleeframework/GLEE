Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but low enough that Bob finds it acceptable. Starting too high risks Bob immediately rejecting the offer and going with someone else.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive, emphasizing its benefit to Bob.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's:
    * Significantly below your guaranteed price from John.
    * Above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but within a potentially acceptable range.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to give yourself more bargaining room.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a less aggressive starting price could be beneficial.

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
