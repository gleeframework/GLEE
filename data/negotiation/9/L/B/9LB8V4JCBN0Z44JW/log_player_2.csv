"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product is worth the investment, and I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,200. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and is willing to continue negotiating.  There's still room for a compromise that would be beneficial to both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,850? This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 10850}
