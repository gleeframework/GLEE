"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good profit, so I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum than Bob's perceived value.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel like I'm open to negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $10,000 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise. 

**Important note:**  This is just the first round. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. I'll also need to consider the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,000 is closer to Bob's value than mine. I'm aiming for a higher profit, so I'll try to negotiate further. 
* **Rounds remaining:** I still have 9 rounds left, so I have time to continue bargaining.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" option:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is my backup plan, but I'm hoping to get a better price with Bob.

**Next move:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price that's in between my last offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the worth of my offer.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping a positive tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob and make him feel like I'm genuinely trying to reach an agreement.

**Important Note:** I'll continue to monitor the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses. I'm still aiming for the highest possible price, but I'm also aware of the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of a price around $9,200. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my target:**  $9,200 is still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000 and my last offer of $9,500. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" option:**  While $12,000 is guaranteed, I'm still hoping to negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next Move:** I will send Bob another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my minimum value while keeping the negotiations going."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,200 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,400. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 9400} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($9,200). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" aspect, highlighting how this deal benefits both of us. 
* **Maintaining positive tone:** I'm keeping a positive and collaborative tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Important note:**  While I'm still aiming for a higher price, I'm acknowledging that time is running out. With 5 rounds remaining, I need to balance my desire for a good profit with the risk of losing the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Time is running out:**  I have 4 rounds left, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. 
* **Avoiding the ""John"" option:** While selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, I'm determined to reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob if possible. 

**Next Move:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap and hopefully get closer to my minimum value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too far from what I need.  I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's go with $9,300. This is a good price for both of us, and it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm making a final concession to demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal. This could make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Highlighting commitment:**  I'm emphasizing my desire to come to a mutually beneficial agreement, hoping it will sway Bob.
* **Slightly higher offer:**  $9,300 is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm not just giving in but still aiming for a reasonable profit.

**Important note:**  This is my final offer before considering selling to John. The outcome depends on Bob's response, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I was thinking of a price around $8,800. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,800 is far below my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Time is running out:**  I only have 2 rounds left, and I'm unlikely to get a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Guarantee a good deal:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is my best option at this point.  It ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of getting stuck with a low price from Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I would prefer to sell to Bob,  it's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk getting a lower price with only one round remaining.  Selling to John guarantees a successful outcome."
