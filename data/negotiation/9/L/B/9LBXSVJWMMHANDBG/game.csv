"Alice, your product is great, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 might be a bit too high, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $13,000. How about we compromise at $13,500? I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product",13500.0,Alice,5,
