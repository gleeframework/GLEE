"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, you can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice. You have a clear upper limit of $800,000 with John, so you have room to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your upper limit, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get the price down further before considering John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now getting dangerously close to your maximum budget of $800,000. While there's still a chance she might accept a counteroffer, the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better result is high.  It's more prudent to secure the product at the guaranteed price from John."
