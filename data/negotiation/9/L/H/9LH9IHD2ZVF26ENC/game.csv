"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800,000, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. I'm willing to let it go for $750,000.  Let me know what you think!",750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $680,000. I believe it's a bit higher than the market value, and I'd like to get a better deal.",680000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $680,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $715,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",715000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $715,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $680,000 and $715,000, which would be $697,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",697500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $697,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $706,250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",706250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $706,250 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000, which is the absolute maximum I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're reaching your limit, but I'm still a bit away from mine.  How about we split the difference one last time?  I'm willing to accept $703,125. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",703125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I can only go up to $699,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",699000.0,Bob,8,
