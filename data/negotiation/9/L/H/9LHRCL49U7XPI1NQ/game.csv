"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $990000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's too close to its true value. I'll make one more counteroffer: I'll consider a price of $1020000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
