,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? That gives you a good deal while ensuring I can still make a profit. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a good compromise, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, I still need to be closer to my desired price point. Let's try $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a decent profit. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your desired price point, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $1,525,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit and reach an agreement. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
