"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is higher than Bob's desired price of $15,000.
* **Next step:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which I feel is a fair compromise. This product will bring you a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $15,000, but closer.
* **Next step:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price even closer to his target. It's worth exploring if a further compromise is possible before buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  It's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm confident we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but my price reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,800, but that's my final offer.  I need to be fair to myself, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $12,800 is still slightly higher than Bob's desired price of $15,000, but closer.
* **Next step:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating. Alice has indicated this is her final offer, but it's worth attempting one more counteroffer to see if she'll budge further. It's a risk, but the potential savings are significant. If this fails, Bob can always buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $12,800 is still just a bit out of my budget. If you're willing to come down to $12,600, I'm ready to make the purchase. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 12600}
