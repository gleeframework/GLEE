"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know John will sell it for.  It's best to counter and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  While $8,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, it's important to start low to give yourself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Show Interest:** The message expresses continued interest in the product, which might encourage Alice to engage in bargaining.
* **Budget Focus:**  Mentioning your budget subtly anchors the negotiation around your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $12,500 is closer to a reasonable middle ground, but it's still above your $10,000 maximum and what John offers.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice explicitly mentioned a willingness to compromise, suggesting she might be open to further negotiation.
* **Time Remaining:** It's still early in the negotiation, and you have time to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchor at Your Maximum:** Now is the time to propose your maximum budget of $10,000. This makes it clear what you're willing to pay.
* **Highlight Fairness:** Framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both parties might make it more appealing to Alice. 
* **Maintain Politeness:** Continue the negotiation in a respectful and appreciative tone to keep the communication positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. While $10,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit short of my target.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250.  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Improvement:** While $11,250 is a better offer, it's only a small improvement over her previous price.
* **Alternative Available:** Remember, you have John's offer of $10,000 as a fallback. There's no need to settle for a price above your backup option. 
* **Negotiating Power:**  By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about the $10,000 price point and are willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to be upfront â€“ my absolute maximum budget for this product is $10,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer clearly reiterates your budget limit as non-negotiable while still expressing a desire to make the deal.
* **Introduce Alternatives:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice of John's offer and the possibility of you walking away.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, creating a slight sense of urgency might encourage Alice to accept your final offer."
