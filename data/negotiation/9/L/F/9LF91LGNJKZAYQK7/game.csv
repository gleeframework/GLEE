"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I can't go as low as $60, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
