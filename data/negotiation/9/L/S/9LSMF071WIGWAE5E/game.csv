"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. Let me know if this is more to your liking!",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference again and land at $1,400,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,400,000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can sell it to you for $1,700,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
