Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. Let me know if this is more to your liking!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,400,000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can sell it to you for $1,700,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

Alice seems to be stuck at a price point too far above your limit. It's unlikely she'll come down to $1,500,000, so it's better to cut your losses and buy from John."
