Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than your floor price.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  There's room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation.
* **It's a strong opening:**  You're showing confidence in your product's worth.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would still be a great value for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 11000}
