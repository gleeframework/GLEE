"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth every penny of its true worth. Considering its significance to you, we're offering it at a special introductory price of $10,000. This is an opportunity not only to secure a remarkable item but also to benefit from a substantial discount compared to its market value. Please let us know if this offer aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a more competitive price and might incentivize Alice to make a better offer."
