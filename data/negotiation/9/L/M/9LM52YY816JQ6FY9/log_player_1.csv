Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it's worth at least $100, so I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is offering the price I value the product at, it's clear he's trying to negotiate me down from my initial offer. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, it makes more sense to take the sure sale rather than risk Bob walking away in further negotiation rounds."
