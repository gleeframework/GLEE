Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** You leave room to potentially make a concession.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're serious about selling but are also willing to negotiate.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. You can also choose to stop the negotiation and sell to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. Considering the value of the product to me is $12,000, I would like to propose a price of $13,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  You have more leverage in this negotiation, as you have a backup buyer in John.  You'll try to push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down a little further and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still committed to finding a price that aligns with the value I place on this product. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $13,000. This is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while also staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is adamant about $13,000, and we've already gone back and forth.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  John is a guaranteed sale at a higher price.  We'll sell to John and avoid further potential haggling."
