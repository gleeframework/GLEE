"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1500000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Is there any room for negotiation?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. I'm going to lower my price one more time to $1400000.  This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  Is that a price we can agree on?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end?",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is really my bottom line, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this product and be happy with your purchase.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about considering other options, though.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
