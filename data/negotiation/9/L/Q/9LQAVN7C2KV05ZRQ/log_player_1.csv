{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that's beneficial to me (closer to my $15,000 target), but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also important to communicate the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still quite a bit lower than my desired price. I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500.  This still reflects the value of the product, but it's also a price that I believe we can both be happy with.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $9,800. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my target price of $12,000. While I would prefer to get closer to that target, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a sale to John for $8,000 is too high. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most financially advantageous decision in this situation."
