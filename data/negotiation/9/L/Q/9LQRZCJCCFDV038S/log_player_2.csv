"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to initiate a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

My initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above my absolute maximum. This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. I've chosen a price that's closer to my budget, while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my budget. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. I still have several rounds to work with and might be able to get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500,  a price that's fair for both of us. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is again lower than Alice's offer, but I'm getting closer to my target price. I've chosen a price that's closer to my budget, but still leaves some room for further negotiation. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also making it clear that I'm serious about securing a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this work. Let's settle at $12,250, and I'll include [mention a small but valuable add-on or service related to the product].  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still above my budget. Even with the added value, the price is too high for me.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. It's getting close to my maximum budget, but I still have some rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer and the add-on, but $12,250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is my final offer. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is closer to my maximum budget but still below Alice's offer. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and pushing Alice towards a decision. By reiterating the ""make this deal happen"" aspect, I'm hoping to appeal to her desire to close the transaction."
