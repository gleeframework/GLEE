"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. My asking price is $170.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I hint at the product's potential value to Bob without revealing my exact minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $140 is below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe there is still a range where we can find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Exploring Options:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and see if we can reach a higher price before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $140 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $160 to see if we can find a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is Still Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer of $160 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $150.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at a loss.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, which shows I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and open tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $150 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my absolute minimum acceptable value for the product.  
* **No Further Upside:**  Accepting his offer guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Time is a Factor:** We're already four rounds in, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Equal Value:**  Selling to John for $150 would result in the same profit as accepting Bob's offer, but accepting now secures the sale."
