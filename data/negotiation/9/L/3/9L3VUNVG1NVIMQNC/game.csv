"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7800.0,Bob,4,
