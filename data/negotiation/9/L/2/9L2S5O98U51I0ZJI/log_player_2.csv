"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a special opportunity for you, given its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than Alice's initial offer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a negotiation and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me. However,  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet my asking price. I am happy to accept $9,000 for the product, as it aligns well with both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now matched Bob's counteroffer, making the price $9,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than the $12,000 he'd pay from John.  There's no guarantee that Bob could get a lower price in future rounds, so accepting this offer is the best option."
