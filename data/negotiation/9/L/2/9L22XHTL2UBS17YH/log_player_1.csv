Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this suggestion is more in line with what you're considering.

While it's tempting to try and push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a strong deal. It provides a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the final price or losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
