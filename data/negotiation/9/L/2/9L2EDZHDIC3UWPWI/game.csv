"Alice, your offer is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your potential profit.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 falls quite a bit short of what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?  This allows me a fair profit while still giving you a good deal on a valuable product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This price would allow both of us to walk away with a reasonable outcome. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
