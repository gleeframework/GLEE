"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? It's still a great price for the value you'll get.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  $11,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This is my final offer.  Let's get this deal done.",10250.0,Bob,4,
