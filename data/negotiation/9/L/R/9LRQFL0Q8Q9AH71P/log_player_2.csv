"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While Alice claims it's a fair price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $780000 is too low for me. The product is worth $800000 to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $800000, which is a fair price for both of us.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Alice has come down to his maximum price, and while he could try to haggle further, there's no guarantee of success and he risks losing the deal. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a price he's willing to pay."
