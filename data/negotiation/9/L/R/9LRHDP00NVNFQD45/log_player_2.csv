"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me and still leaves you a significant profit margin. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price or explore the alternative option of buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of my investment. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a strong offer for both of us. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point. While it's closer to his budget, it's still not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price or consider purchasing from John at a fixed $1,000,000."
