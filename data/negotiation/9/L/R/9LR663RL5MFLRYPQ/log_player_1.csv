Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for it. Would you be open to this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to pay, and it's still less than what John is offering. It makes the most sense to cut negotiations with Bob short and sell to John."
