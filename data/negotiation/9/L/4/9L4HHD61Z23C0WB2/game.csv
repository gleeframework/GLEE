"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I agree the product has value, $12,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
