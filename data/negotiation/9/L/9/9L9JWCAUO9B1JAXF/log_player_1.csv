"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit steep.  Let's try $87.50.  That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could try to push for a bit more, $87.50 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
