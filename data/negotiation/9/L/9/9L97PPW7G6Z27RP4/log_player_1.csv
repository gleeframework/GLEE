Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible before resorting to John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below its value to Bob ($119) makes it tempting. It's a small loss compared to selling to John but a potential gain if Bob accepts. 
* **Clear Communication:** A direct message with a clear price avoids confusion and encourages a swift decision from Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a sale at a price above your minimum."
