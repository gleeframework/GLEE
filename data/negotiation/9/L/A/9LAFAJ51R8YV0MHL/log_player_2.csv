Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value this product offers. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues its true potential and the benefits it can bring to your business.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000. This is a more realistic reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but I need the price to come down more for this to work for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. However,  $1,000,000 is just too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $1,500,000 and even stated it's her final offer.  This price exceeds your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John at your target price, it makes the most financial sense to take that deal."
