"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for success, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let's start the conversation at $2,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:** A high initial offer can ""anchor"" the negotiation, influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and his subsequent counteroffers. 
* **Leaving Room for Concession:**  Offering $2,200,000 leaves ample room for me to make concessions during subsequent rounds while still staying well above my $1,500,000 minimum.

**Important Note:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, the goal is to maximize profit. It's strategically better to explore the potential for a higher sale price with Bob before settling for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own stated value of the product ($1,200,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I still have ample rounds to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value this product offers. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues its true potential and the benefits it can bring to your business.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000. This is a more realistic reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While Bob's offer was far too low, I've made a substantial concession to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The counteroffer of $1,900,000 keeps the price well above my minimum and signals that I'm serious about obtaining a fair value for the product. 
* **Encouraging Movement:** By making a significant move, I hope to encourage Bob to respond with a counteroffer that shows a greater willingness to meet closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but I need the price to come down more for this to work for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is improving, it's still below my $1,500,000 minimum.  It's too early in the negotiation to accept an offer that represents a loss, especially when I have a guaranteed offer from John. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. However,  $1,000,000 is just too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** I'm explaining my position by highlighting the value proposition again.
* **Finality:** By presenting this as my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative:** This strategy also safeguards against the risk of protracted negotiation, as I can always fall back on John's offer."
