"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for success, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let's start the conversation at $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value this product offers. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues its true potential and the benefits it can bring to your business.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000. This is a more realistic reflection of its worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but I need the price to come down more for this to work for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. However,  $1,000,000 is just too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product will bring you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
