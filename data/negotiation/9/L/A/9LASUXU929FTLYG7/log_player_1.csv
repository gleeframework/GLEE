{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering the product for $10,000, which is a decent discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000 (John's offer) as a last resort.
* **Bob's Perspective:**  $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $8,000 to him. He's likely to consider it.

**Note:** This is just a starting offer.  I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. I believe I can secure a higher price if I counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $12,000 is my safety net. It's still my goal to get a better price from Bob, but if the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $9,250 is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Fair Value:** I believe $9,250 is a fair price, as it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and also within Bob's budget.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation going and increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a fair price, and I appreciate you coming down. However, $9,250 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a higher price if I counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $12,000 is still a safety net, but I'm determined to try and get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $9,250, trying to reach a compromise that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $8,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit away.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This would give us both a fair price, and we could finalize the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  My counteroffer of $9,000 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $9,250 and Bob's offer of $8,750. This demonstrates a clear willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer narrows the price gap, increasing the likelihood of a deal being struck.
* **Positive Negotiation:**  By suggesting a compromise, I'm maintaining a positive tone and showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
