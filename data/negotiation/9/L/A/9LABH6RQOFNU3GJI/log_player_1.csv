Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price:**  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It shows confidence in the product's value:**  A high initial offer can make Bob think the product is very valuable.

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. Here's why:

* **It's still above my minimum acceptable price:** This ensures I don't sell below my floor.
* **It shows I'm willing to compromise:** This indicates I'm serious about selling to Bob and encourages further negotiations.
* **It leaves room for another counteroffer:** This gives Bob the opportunity to meet me in the middle.

I'm also keeping the message friendly and focused on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1750000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to offer $1550000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to secure the sale and move forward."
