"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit, but it also leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $140 is a little more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, though. How about $130?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price if I continue the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $135 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $132?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $132 is still a good deal for me, and it's getting close to the value Bob is placing on the product. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, and I don't want to sell to John for a lower price."
