Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial price is significantly above Bob's perceived value. While this might seem aggressive, it establishes the product's value in your eyes. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Safety Net (John):**  You have the security of John's offer, giving you leverage in negotiations with Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** Ideally, Bob agrees to a price significantly higher than his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Gather Information:**  Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer) will provide valuable insight into his willingness to pay. 

You can then adjust your negotiation strategy based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his own perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum ($1,200,000) and your initial asking price. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain Negotiation Position:**  Accepting immediately might signal that you're willing to go much lower, potentially leaving money on the table.
* **Counteroffer Strategically:**  You can now propose a counteroffer that brings the price closer to your desired range while still leaving room for further negotiation. 

You have the security of John's offer, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a price below your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product brings warrants a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You've reduced your price by $100,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Meeting Halfway (Roughly):** This counteroffer lands roughly halfway between your initial price and Bob's offer, encouraging him to move closer to your range.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces your position and justifies the higher price point.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Continue Negotiation:** Keep the dialogue open and encourage Bob to make a more favorable offer. 
* **Maintain Profitability:**  While you're willing to negotiate, you're still aiming for a price that meets your needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk:

* **Bob Might Walk Away:** He's already shown some reluctance to go higher.  Pushing further might make him lose interest entirely.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer secures a small profit over that. 

Ultimately, accepting $1,225,000 represents a successful negotiation outcome where you've exceeded your minimum price and secured a profitable deal."
