"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product brings warrants a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
