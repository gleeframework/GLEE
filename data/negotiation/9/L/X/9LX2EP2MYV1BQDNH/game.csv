"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into developing it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer, but still a little rich for me.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into developing it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
