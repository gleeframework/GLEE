"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really like it.  I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though. Would you be willing to come down to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $100 is too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That would be a fair compromise, don't you think? ",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $137.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is a significant compromise from my original offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $125.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
