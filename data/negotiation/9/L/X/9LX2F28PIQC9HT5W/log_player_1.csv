"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really like it.  I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Being Open:** Saying I'm open to negotiation shows I'm willing to work with Bob, making him more likely to engage.
* **Positive Language:**  Using positive language like ""great product"" can make Bob more interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though. Would you be willing to come down to $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** $100 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to $150.
* **John is a backup option.** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I know John is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $100 is too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That would be a fair compromise, don't you think? "", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my previous price and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair compromise"" appeals to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Slightly Higher:** I'm still above my minimum but leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $137.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is a significant compromise from my original offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Time is running out:**  I'm getting closer to the end of the negotiation, and I want to avoid selling for too low.
* **John is a safer bet:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees my minimum profit, and with each rejected offer, he becomes increasingly attractive.  

I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price, but if Bob rejects it again, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $125.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is likely my last chance to negotiate with Bob before I go with John. I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing it as a fair price for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to agree.
* **Urgency:** This counteroffer conveys a sense of finality, hinting that I may not have much room to budge further."
