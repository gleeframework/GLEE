"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That way we can both get a good deal and move forward.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
