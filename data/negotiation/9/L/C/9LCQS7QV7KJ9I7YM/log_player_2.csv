Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $12750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's close, you've already negotiated for several rounds and it's likely that further negotiations will be time-consuming. It's better to secure the product from John at your budget-friendly price."
