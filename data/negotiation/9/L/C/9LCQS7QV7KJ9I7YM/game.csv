"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
