Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. Here's why:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  The price is above what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still below what you need to make it worthwhile.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential deal that benefits both parties.
* **It shows you're serious about selling:**  By making a concrete offer, you demonstrate your interest in selling to Bob.

This is just the first step in the negotiation. Be prepared to adapt based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to what he's willing to pay, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not going to accept such a low offer, but I'm also not going to sell to John just yet. There's still room to negotiate with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise, but if he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
