"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm looking for $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This price reflects both the product's worth and my budget constraints.  I'm open to further discussion if you're interested.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm proposing a new price of $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to consider this offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. I believe it's a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm proposing a new price of $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
