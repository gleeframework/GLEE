"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.
