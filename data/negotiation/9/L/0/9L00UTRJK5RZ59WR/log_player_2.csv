"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a good price, there's a chance to negotiate an even better deal since Alice is motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product. However, I'm working with a tighter budget at the moment. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're still a significant amount below John's price. We'll aim lower again to see if there's more room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me right now.  How about we settle at $10,500? That would work much better for me."",
 ""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. I believe it's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer by stating it's the lowest she'll go. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she won't budge, and we'll end up closer to John's price. Accepting at $11,000 secures a good deal."
