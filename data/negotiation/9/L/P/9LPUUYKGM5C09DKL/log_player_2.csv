"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is offering the product for exactly $12,000, you have no incentive to accept her offer.  You can get the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain the option of potentially negotiating a lower price with Alice or finding another seller."
