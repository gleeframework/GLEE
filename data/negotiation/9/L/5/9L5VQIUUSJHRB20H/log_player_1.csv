"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so he might counteroffer. I'll keep an eye on the rounds and John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still not ideal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can squeeze out a little more.  I'm keeping a close eye on John's offer, though, in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping he'll see the value of the product and meet me halfway.  I'm also mindful of John's offer, so if Bob rejects this counteroffer, I might have to reconsider my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now within my acceptable range. I've got to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing him as a buyer against the extra $2,000 I'd get from John. It's a gamble, but I think it's better to take the sure thing at this point."
