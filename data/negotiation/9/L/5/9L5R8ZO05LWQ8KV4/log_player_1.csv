{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me.  I'm starting high, but I'm willing to negotiate down to a price that is still above my minimum.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer, John, who will pay $800,000. This gives me some leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent profit, I can likely get more by negotiating further with Bob. He's already shown a willingness to compromise.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $875000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and still significantly above my minimum. Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether and ending up with the lower offer from John.  It's time to finalize the sale and secure a good profit."
