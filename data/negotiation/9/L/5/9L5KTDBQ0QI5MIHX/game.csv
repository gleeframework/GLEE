,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate you're interested.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $95?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to meet me at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.  How about $92.50? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
