"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You can do better than $100, so reject the offer and counter with a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate you're interested.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $95?  That's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You can still do better than $95.  Reject and counter again, but be prepared to go to John if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to meet me at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.  How about $92.50? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, you've already gone back and forth a few times with Alice, and she's only willing to come down to $92.50. You're willing to spend $80, and John is selling the product for that price.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing!"
