{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly approach, acknowledging Bob's potential interest.  The price is set at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately cutting off the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value and within my budget, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate you're interested.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $95?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to meet me at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to counter his offer again to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.  How about $92.50? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
