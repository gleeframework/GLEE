"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum price of $15,000 and buying from John would cost you more."
