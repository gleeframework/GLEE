"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above its worth to her ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. 
* While you'd pay $12,000 with John, rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to your ideal price range."
