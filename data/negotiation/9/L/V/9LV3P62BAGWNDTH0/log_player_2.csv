Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,150,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering the product for $1,150,000. While it's slightly above my ideal price, it's a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  

Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but there's also the risk that Alice won't budge further, and I'd lose out on this deal. It's better to secure a good price now than risk overplaying my hand."
