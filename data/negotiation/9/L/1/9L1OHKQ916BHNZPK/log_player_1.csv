"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm willing to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good investment for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a strong value for me. I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to take one more round to see if I can get him to budge further. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher, especially since he's already made a significant increase from his previous offer. Selling to John at this point would be a safe option, but I want to maximize my potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still not a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're serious about acquiring this, I encourage you to accept."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and a significant step up from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I've been trying to maximize my earnings, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  To avoid risking a complete failure of the negotiation,  I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees me a safe and profitable outcome."
