"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $800000, but I am willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and a price that I believe reflects its potential benefits for your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount from her true value, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for a lower price."
