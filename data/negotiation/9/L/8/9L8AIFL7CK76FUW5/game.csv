"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and it would be a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be straightforward. I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,000,000 for this product. I'm offering you the chance to close the deal first, but I need to see a more serious commitment from your side. Would you be willing to consider $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you have another buyer interested in the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",775000.0,Bob,6,
