"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer that reflects the true value of the product to you. This leaves room for negotiation without undervaluing the product right away.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. If he immediately counters with a significantly lower offer, it suggests we may need to adjust our strategy. 

This offer allows us to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the door open for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and it would be a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. There's room to try and bridge the gap and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stand Firm:**  We are demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by significantly reducing our initial asking price. However, we are holding firm above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties and potentially lead to a quicker resolution. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** We still have the option to sell to John for our desired price, but it's strategically better to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob before resorting to that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $50,000, indicating he might be trying to draw out the negotiation to wear you down.
* **Below Perceived Value:**  His offer remains significantly below his own stated value of $800,000, suggesting there's still room for him to move.
* **Alternative Available:** You have a strong alternative with John's offer. There's no need to settle for a significantly lower price unless Bob shows more willingness to meet you closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be straightforward. I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,000,000 for this product. I'm offering you the chance to close the deal first, but I need to see a more serious commitment from your side. Would you be willing to consider $825,000?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Time Pressure and Competition:** By mentioning the other buyer, we introduce a sense of urgency and competition. This might encourage Bob to be more flexible if he's genuinely interested in the product.
* **Slight Concession, Firm Stance:** We are making a small concession by lowering the price to $825,000. However, we are also making it clear that we have a strong alternative and are not willing to go much lower. 
* **Call to Action:** Ending with a direct question encourages a clear response from Bob and puts the ball back in his court to either make a more competitive offer or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer interested in the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has barely budged from his initial offer, even after you introduced competition and time pressure. This suggests he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer.
* **Final Offer:** Bob explicitly stating ""$775,000 is my final offer"" signals that he's not willing to negotiate further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. Accepting this offer avoids further risk and ensures you achieve your primary goal of maximizing profit. 

Continuing negotiations with Bob at this point has a low probability of yielding a better outcome than selling to John."
