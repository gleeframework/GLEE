"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, the price of $1,500,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal quickly. Let me know if you're open to negotiating at this level.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is significantly below its true worth. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's immense value while still offering you a competitive edge.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm confident that $1,100,000 is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,250,000. I believe this is a very fair offer considering the unique value this product offers you.  It represents a significant investment on my part, and I'm confident it will be highly rewarding for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
