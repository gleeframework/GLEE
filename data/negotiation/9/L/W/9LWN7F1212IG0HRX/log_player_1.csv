Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth more than Bob's valuation. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $120, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, we've potentially left money on the table. If he rejects, we can always negotiate down, knowing we have John as a backup. 
* **Confidence:**  The message implies confidence in the product's value, which might influence Bob's perception.

It's important to remember, this is just the opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her strategy accordingly."
