Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly unique and I believe it holds immense value. I'm asking for $2,000,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I have a fallback option with John for $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Building Excitement:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value of the product and create a sense of urgency for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its uniqueness and value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1800000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While $1,800,000 is less than my initial ask, it's still above my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's potential to negotiate further and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Testing Bob's commitment:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how committed Bob is to acquiring the product and potentially get a higher counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, I'm looking for a price closer to my initial asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,900,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains my position.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Framing it as ""meeting in the middle"" makes it seem like a fair compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:** The message is positive and solution-oriented, creating a good negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1750000 for the product. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:** Bob's latest offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  I'm concerned that further negotiation with Bob will only result in a lower price, potentially jeopardizing my profit.
* **Secure Option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit. This is a safe and reliable option that avoids further negotiation risks."
