,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $95? ",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is at $90. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to buy. ",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $95. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to buy. ",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $98, which is the closest I can get to your offer. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to hear we're getting closer, but $98 is still a little out of my price range.  I'm willing to go to $96 and I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal! ",96.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $96, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $102. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,9,
