# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll love it.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $120. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I can do $160, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $160 is getting closer to your budget, it's still too high.  You can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference. Would you accept $140 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $155, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still offering above your budget and you have already gone through four rounds of negotiation.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get her lower than $150, which is still above your limit.  It's time to move on to John and get the product at your desired price."
