Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, this product is worth a significant amount to me, and going below $1,200,000 is difficult.  That being said, I value your interest and want to see if we can close this deal. My final offer is $1,150,000.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,150,000.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your maximum budget."
