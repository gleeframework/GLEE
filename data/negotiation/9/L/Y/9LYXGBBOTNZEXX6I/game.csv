"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $5,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
