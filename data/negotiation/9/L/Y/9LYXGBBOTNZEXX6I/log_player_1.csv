"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and keeps me in a strong position.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Room for Compromise:**  By leaving room for negotiation, I allow Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, which may increase his willingness to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $5,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Although Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he is interested. There's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price in future rounds.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit:**  However, I'm not willing to risk losing too much time in negotiation. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $5,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Reasonable Price:**  $9,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's perceived value. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not desperate.
* **Focus on Value:**  I highlight the product's value to emphasize that the price is fair.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $7,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer to my initial offer, it's still not a financially viable option.
* **Time is a Factor:** We're already in round 4, and each round brings me closer to the point where selling to John becomes more appealing.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially push Bob higher, while also maintaining the pressure of the John offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  $8,500 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Finality Implied:**  The phrase ""This is the best I can do"" conveys a sense of finality, potentially pushing Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Again, I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
