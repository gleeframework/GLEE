"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $800,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree that this product is valuable, however, I believe that $800,000 is a bit high. I would be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm making a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $550,000? I believe this is a fair offer reflecting the value it holds for me.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the price lower, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm making a counteroffer of $650,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $650,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be open to $600,000? I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm making a counteroffer of $620,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",620000.0,Alice,7,
