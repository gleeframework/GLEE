"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a good price for both of us, and it's still below what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you at $130 for the product. I hope this offer works for you.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, $130 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair compromise, and it's a better price than you'd get elsewhere.  Let's make this deal happen.",135.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $132 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $132 just isn't quite working for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $134? This would be a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident we can finalize this today!",134.0,Alice,7,
