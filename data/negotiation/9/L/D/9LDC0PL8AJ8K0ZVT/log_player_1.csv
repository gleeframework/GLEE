I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is close to my minimum, I have 2 more rounds to work with.  It's risky, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to my minimum price. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is only slightly above my minimum, and I have no more rounds to negotiate.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
