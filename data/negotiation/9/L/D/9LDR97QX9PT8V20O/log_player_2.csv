"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. Although it's closer, Bob can potentially still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11750. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000.  While it's getting closer, Bob has already made two counteroffers and is unlikely to get Alice to go lower.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might become unwilling to sell at all, and Bob could end up with nothing. 

Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $10,000, it's the most logical choice to accept that offer. It ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids any further risk of a failed negotiation."
