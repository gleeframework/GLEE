"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand it's a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $120.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",120.5,Alice,5,
