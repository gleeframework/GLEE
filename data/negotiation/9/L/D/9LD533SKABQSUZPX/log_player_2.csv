Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $120.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120.5

It's not worth haggling further. Alice is unlikely to drop below $120 and John offers a guaranteed price of $120."
