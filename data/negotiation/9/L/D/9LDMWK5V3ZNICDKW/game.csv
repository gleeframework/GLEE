"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. This product would be useful to me, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $14,000? That would be a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is too low. I'm willing to increase my offer, but $14,000 is still too high for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
