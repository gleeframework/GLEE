Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about a price of $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Starting High:**  Offering a price of $100 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Fairness:** While aiming to maximize profit, a price closer to the middle ground between your minimum and Bob's maximum feels fairer and might make Bob more inclined to accept.

This strategy aims to secure a sale price significantly above your minimum while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
