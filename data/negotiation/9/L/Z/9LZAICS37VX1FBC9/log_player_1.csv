Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 gives you significant room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specifics that Bob could use to counter. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you leave the door open for negotiation and gauge his interest level. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. However,  a very high initial offer might discourage Bob from further negotiation. You will need to adapt your approach based on his response."
