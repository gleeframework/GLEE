"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm not quite willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be as low as possible, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can see you're willing to go up to $875000, so I'll meet you there. However, I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $875000, but I'll also include a complimentary service package worth $25000. That's a $25000 value, absolutely free. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $875000, but I'd like to try to shave off another $5000. Can you consider selling the product to me for $870000?",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you at $870000. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer the product to you for $870000, but I'll throw in an additional warranty package worth $10000. That's a $10000 value, absolutely free. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional warranty package, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $870000, but I'd like to try to shave off another $5000. Can you consider selling the product to me for $865000?",865000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $865000, but I'm not going any lower. I'll throw in one last concession: I'll include a premium support package worth $5000, which is usually an extra $5000 on top of the price. That's a total of $15000 in extras, absolutely free. What do you think?",865000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the premium support package, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $865000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to have to think about this and consider other options. If I don't hear back from you, I may have to buy the product from John for $800000.",865000.0,Bob,10,
