"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its true value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You are willing to pay up to $8,000. Alice's offer is too high, so you should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice has lowered her price to $8,500, which is within your budget. Accepting her offer means you get the product for a slightly higher price than you hoped for, but it's still a better deal than buying from John for $8,000."
