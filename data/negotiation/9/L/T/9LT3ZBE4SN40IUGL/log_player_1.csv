Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I want to see if I can get a good price before turning to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $140 is higher than my minimum value of $120, and it's close enough to my initial offer that I'm willing to accept it.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
