"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I've seen it for elsewhere. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $110, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. It's a one-time offer, so think carefully before making a decision!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was still a bit out of your range, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle again? I can do $105, which is still a great deal for both of us. It's a one-time offer, so think carefully before making a decision!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit out of your range, and I appreciate your willingness to stay within your budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do $102, which is as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Think carefully before making a decision!",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but $102 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I really think that's a fair price, and I'm starting to get a bit worried that I might have to walk away and buy it from John for $80.",90.0,Bob,8,
