"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to be more flexible, but I still need to meet my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium support package and a 30-day warranty. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
