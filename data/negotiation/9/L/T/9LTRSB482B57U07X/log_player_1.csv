Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $125 is closer, it's still a little more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the maximum he's willing to pay, and while it's not ideal for me, it's still a decent profit. It's better than selling to John for $150 and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in further rounds. So I'll accept Bob's offer."
