"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to recover a fair price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
