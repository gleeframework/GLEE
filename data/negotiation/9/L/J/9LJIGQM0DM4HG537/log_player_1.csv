Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While a simple ""take it or leave it"" approach might work, providing a reason for the price can make Bob more receptive. Mentioning ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment"" appeals to his potential gain.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000.  This takes the pressure off and allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
