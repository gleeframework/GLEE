"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way too high. Bob's goal is to save money, and $20,000 is significantly more than his $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a price he's willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $15,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still too high.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand it's valuable to you, but $15,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we settle at $10,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. $10,000 is still quite low, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has made it clear that she's unlikely to go lower than $13,000.  This is still outside Bob's desired price range.  Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price, saving him $5,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
