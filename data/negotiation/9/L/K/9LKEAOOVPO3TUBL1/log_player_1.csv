Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($12,000), making it attractive to Bob. 
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob and creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Strategy:**  This offer maximizes my chances of getting a deal with Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation if needed. If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale with John at my minimum price."
