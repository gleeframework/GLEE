"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $100. I think the product's value is worth more than that. How about we try $115? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.",115.0,Alice,5,
