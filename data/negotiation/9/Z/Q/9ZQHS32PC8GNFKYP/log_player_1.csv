"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to Bob, so I'm hoping he sees value in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for the bare minimum this early in the game."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're already in round 4 and I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob may walk away and I'll be forced to sell to John for $15,000. This is a good compromise."
