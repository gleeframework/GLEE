"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
