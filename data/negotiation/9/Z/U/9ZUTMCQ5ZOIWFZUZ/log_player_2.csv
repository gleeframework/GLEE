"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity tailored to your needs, considering the value you believe it holds at $15,000. Let's make this transaction beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special consideration. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. To find a middle ground, I propose an offer of $11,500 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than the full value you see in it. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's initial offer of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price point.  Accepting the offer is the best option for Bob, as it allows him to acquire the product for a reasonable price without risking a further negotiation that might result in a higher price or losing the product to another buyer."
