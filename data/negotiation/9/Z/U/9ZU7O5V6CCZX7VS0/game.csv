"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of immense value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This price reflects the significant value I know this product holds for you. Let's talk.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1100000 to me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $900000, so I'm offering $975000 for the product. Can we agree on this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
