Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $7,500.

{""product_price"": 7500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I still need to make a decision. Since I can sell the product to John for $8,000, I'll consider that as an option.

However, I'll also think about the potential profit I could make if I negotiate further with Bob. If I reject his offer and make a counteroffer, I might be able to get closer to the $8,000 mark.

For now, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Let's try to get closer to the $8,000 mark. I'll offer the product to Bob for $7,400.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send my counteroffer to Bob.
