"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come close to my desired price point. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $800,000, so I'll be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to this price.
* **John's Offer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John gives me some leverage.  I can use this as a baseline to assess whether Bob's offers are worthwhile.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:** I'm starting high and will likely adjust my offers based on Bob's responses. I'll be looking for signs of his willingness to negotiate and his perceived value of the product."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, and his initial offer suggests he's willing to pay more than $1,100,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Leverage:** I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'll use this rejection to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price. By making a counteroffer, I can potentially push the price higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows good faith and signals my willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This price is a reasonable compromise that could be attractive to Bob. It's likely he'll see it as a good deal compared to his initial counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to pay more. If he accepts, I'll have secured a good deal. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy for the next round.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's first offer, I've established my stance and demonstrated that I'm not desperate to close the deal. This strengthens my position in the negotiation."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $1,080,000.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him. I'm confident I can push the price up further.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain my bargaining power. 
* **Goal in Sight:**  I'm close to my target price, and I'm not going to settle for something that feels like a loss just yet.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000 or even $1,120,000. I'll closely monitor Bob's responses to gauge his true willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,120,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair price while also showing flexibility.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, signaling my willingness to meet him halfway.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** It's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 
* **Testing the Limits:** This counteroffer will gauge how serious Bob is about buying the product. If he rejects, I'll need to consider whether I'm willing to go lower or if it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this offer and adjust my strategy for the next round accordingly. If Bob seems hesitant, I might lower my counteroffer slightly. However, if he seems more willing to negotiate, I might stick to my current offer or even raise it slightly."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer. It shows good faith and signals my willingness to negotiate, while also pushing for a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This price is a reasonable compromise that could be attractive to Bob. It's likely he'll see it as a good deal compared to his initial counteroffer.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm getting closer to making a decision about selling to John if I don't get a deal with Bob.

However, if he seems more willing to negotiate, I might stick to my current offer or even try to raise it again, depending on his willingness to pay."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiation is getting tense. Bob's offer of $1,040,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still significantly lower than what I want.  I'm also worried that we might not reach an agreement before time runs out.  

I've decided to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  I don't have much time left to negotiate. It's risky to continue hoping for a better offer from Bob, as he might not come up to my price point.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I would prefer to get closer to $1,100,000, selling to John for $800,000 still represents a substantial profit. It's better than risking a lower offer from Bob or potentially no deal at all. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** John's offer is guaranteed, and selling to him means I can close the deal without further negotiation.  

**Conclusion:**

Although I'm not thrilled about accepting John's offer, it's the most prudent choice given the circumstances. It ensures a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob."
