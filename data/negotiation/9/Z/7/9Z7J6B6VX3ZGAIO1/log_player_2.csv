"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm asking for $1000000 for it, which is a price I believe reflects its worth. I understand this is a significant investment, so I want to assure you that this product has the potential to generate substantial returns.  If you're not interested at this price, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $800000.  Let me know your thoughts, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price. It makes no sense to pay more for the same product from Alice."
