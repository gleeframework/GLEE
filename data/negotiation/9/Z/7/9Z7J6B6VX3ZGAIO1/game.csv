"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm asking for $1000000 for it, which is a price I believe reflects its worth. I understand this is a significant investment, so I want to assure you that this product has the potential to generate substantial returns.  If you're not interested at this price, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $800000.  Let me know your thoughts, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
