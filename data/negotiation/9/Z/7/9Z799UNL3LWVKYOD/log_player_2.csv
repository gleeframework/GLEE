"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be invaluable to your business. While I can't disclose the specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm willing to let you acquire it for $900000. This is a substantial discount from its true value.  If you're interested, I'd be happy to schedule a meeting to discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not sure I like the secrecy around the product's specifics, and the fact that Alice thinks it's only worth $800,000 to her but is willing to sell it to me for $900,000 seems suspicious. I'd rather not take the risk. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,500,000.
