Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to bridge the gap and find a mutually acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that is closer to my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,200.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and a reasonable price considering Bob's previous counteroffers. It's time to close the deal and move on."
