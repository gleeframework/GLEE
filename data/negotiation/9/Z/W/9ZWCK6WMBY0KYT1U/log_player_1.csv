Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Starting higher allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, bringing the price closer to his perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning another buyer creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept your offer rather than risk losing the deal. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll still sell the product for your minimum price to John, but you'll miss out on potentially earning more."
