Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is slightly less than what you could get from John, but it still gives you a profit.  It also leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's willing to pay closer to your value.  Since Bob values the product at $80, a price of $95 is a good starting point to potentially reach an agreement."
