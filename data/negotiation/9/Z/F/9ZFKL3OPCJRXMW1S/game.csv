"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,200,000 is appealing, I must admit it's a bit lower than I had hoped for.  Could you consider $1,275,000?  I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above that. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
