"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $90. Would you be willing to consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a bit low, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $97.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price, and it gets me closer to my minimum.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
