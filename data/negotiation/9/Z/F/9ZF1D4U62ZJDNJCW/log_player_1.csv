Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $100. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price, and it gets me closer to my minimum.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
