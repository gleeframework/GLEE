,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,600,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is fair, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you consider $2,100,000?  I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
