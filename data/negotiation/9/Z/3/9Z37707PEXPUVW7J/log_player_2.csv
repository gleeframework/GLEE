"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1000000.  This represents a significant savings compared to its true value.  I understand you have your own assessment, but this price offers a great potential for return on your investment. Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true value, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product for $800,000 from John, saving him $200,000."
