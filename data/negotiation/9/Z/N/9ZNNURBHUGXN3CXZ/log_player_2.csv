"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close a deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly less than John's price of $1,200,000, and while it's a bit more than Bob's counteroffer, it's still a good deal for Bob.  It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small decrease in the price, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer isn't worth it."
