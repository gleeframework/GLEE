Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's wise to begin negotiations above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge his interest.
* **Near Your Walk-Away:**  The price is close to your guaranteed sale price to John, providing a safety net. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""potential,"" you subtly remind Bob of its value without explicitly revealing your bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer is still above his perceived value of the product ($800,000), indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $900,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's offer.
* **Strategic Counter:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you value the product higher and encourage him to improve his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I could consider a price of $1,050,000.  This offer reflects a willingness to find middle ground while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** The large decrease from your initial offer signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above Midpoint:**  The price is strategically placed above the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the ""true potential"" subtly reinforces the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer only increased by $50,000, indicating he might be reaching his upper limit but is also trying to negotiate slowly.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  The guaranteed $1,200,000 from John provides a strong alternative if negotiations stall.
* **Potential for More:** You can still likely negotiate a higher price from Bob, especially if you signal a willingness to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. My final offer is $1,000,000. This takes into account the value you see while respecting the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Using phrases like ""final offer"" and ""to be completely transparent"" signal that this is your last concession.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning the other buyer (without specifics) creates urgency and leverage.
* **Respectful but Firm:** You acknowledge Bob's perspective while reinforcing your position on the product's value. 
* **Acceptable Return:**  While not ideal, $1,000,000 is still a significant profit above your minimum."
