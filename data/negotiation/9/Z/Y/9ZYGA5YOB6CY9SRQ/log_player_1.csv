Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than your backup offer from John.
* **Justify the Value:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" reinforces the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong fallback option with John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum."
