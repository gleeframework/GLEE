"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $900,000? This would be a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $750,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but how about $850,000? That's a good midpoint between our last offers and reflects the real value of this product to you. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're close.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle this right now at $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
