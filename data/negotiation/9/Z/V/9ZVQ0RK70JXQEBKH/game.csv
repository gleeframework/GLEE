"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value of similar products, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet you at $750000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the unique features and benefits it offers. Let me know if you're willing to consider this revised offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $775000. Can you consider this price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's unique features. Let me know if you're willing to consider this revised offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a new offer, $790000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price of similar products. Can you consider this offer?",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $790000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $815000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's unique features. Let me know if you're willing to consider this revised offer.",815000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last offer, $795000. I think this is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",795000.0,Bob,8,

"I've made it to the final round, and I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer. I'm sticking with $795000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1500000. I'm hoping we can still come to an agreement.",795000.0,Bob,10,
