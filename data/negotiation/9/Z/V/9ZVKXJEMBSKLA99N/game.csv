"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. How about we try $9500? I think that's a fair price for the product's value.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $9500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10500. This is a significant compromise on my end. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're still trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. But $10000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10250 as a final offer.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested.",10250.0,Alice,7,
