Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the value to Bob. This is a strong opening offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price of $800,000.  It's better than nothing, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more.  I'm also considering selling to John, but I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to counter with $825,000. This is a more significant concession than before, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still a bit lower than what I'd like.  At this point, I'm getting tired of negotiating and I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher.  It's better to just sell to John and get a guaranteed $800,000.  I'm not going to risk another round of negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
