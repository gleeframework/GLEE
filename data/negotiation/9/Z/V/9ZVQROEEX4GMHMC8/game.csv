"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone, however. I'm happy to pay $10,500, which is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair middle ground.  I hope you'll consider this offer. ",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is a small increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
