"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $12,000.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. You should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for Alice as it's more than her valuation, and it gives me a significant saving compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$10,000 is a good price for me, and I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's also likely that Alice won't go lower, given her valuation of the product."
