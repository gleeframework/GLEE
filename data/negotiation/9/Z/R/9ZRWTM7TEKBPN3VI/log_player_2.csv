"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $20,000 is above your maximum budget of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This allows for room to negotiate upwards while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping Alice will counter with a price closer to my offer, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I have a few rounds left, and it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith and willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a good compromise, but it's closer to my budget than Alice's last offer. I hope this encourages Alice to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, and we're running out of rounds. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with her. Buying from John at $15,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget."
