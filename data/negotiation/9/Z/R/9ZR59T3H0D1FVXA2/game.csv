"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $8,800? This is a good deal for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about it. How about we meet at $9,100? This is a bit closer to my target, and I'm willing to consider it.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget with each offer. How about we split the difference and go with $8,950? It's a good price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",8950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're getting closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,950. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,200? This is my final concession, and I'm willing to consider it.",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,000, and I think that's a fair deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me there, I might have to look at other options.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make this work, Bob, but I've already made a concession to $9,200, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,400 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to consider it, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",9400.0,Alice,9,
