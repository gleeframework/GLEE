"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  $130 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let me know if that works for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $135. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to negotiating further, but $132.50 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $133.75?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",133.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm still not comfortable with $133.75. How about we try $131.25? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $132.50, but I'd like to save a bit more.",131.25,Bob,6,
