Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is less than what John is selling it for ($12,000).
* **You're saving money:** Accepting Alice's offer means you'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, you're still getting a good deal at $10,000, especially since you're willing to pay up to $12,000."
