"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $130 is within your budget, it's still higher than the price John offers. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $115, which is still within my budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to get the best possible price. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above John's price.  While it's tempting to accept, the goal is to save as much as possible. It's worth pushing for a lower price, as there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering John's price, which is my maximum budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I won't go any higher.  If she accepts, it's a win for me. If she rejects, we'll see if she's willing to budge in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is only $2 less than John's price.  While it's not a huge difference, it's still a loss for me. Since I'm already within my budget with John's offer, I'm going to buy from him to ensure I get the best possible price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price, and it's not worth the risk of running out of rounds."
