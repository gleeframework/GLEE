"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still allows me some profit while giving you a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
