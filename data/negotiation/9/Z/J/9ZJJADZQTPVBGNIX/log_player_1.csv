Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, getting Bob to buy it allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than John's offer. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:**  This creates a sense of scarcity and value, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept before he ""misses out"". 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value of $800,000. There's a risk he'll find the initial offer too high.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear strategy for your minimum acceptable price is crucial."
