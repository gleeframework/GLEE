"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $12000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being flexible, Alice.  $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $13000?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me at $13000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $13250? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make this deal worthwhile for me.",13250.0,Alice,5,
