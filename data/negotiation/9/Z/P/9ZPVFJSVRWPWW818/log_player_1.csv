{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can negotiate a higher price. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price and what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $9,500 is my bottom line. I believe this is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
