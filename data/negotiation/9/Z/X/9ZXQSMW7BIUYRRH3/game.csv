"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a premium for the comprehensive guide and satisfaction guarantee, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? I'm willing to pay a bit more for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget of $80. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to.",78.0,Bob,4,
