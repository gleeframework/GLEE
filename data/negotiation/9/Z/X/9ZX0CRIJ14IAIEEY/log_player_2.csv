"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a price of $13,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You should reject the offer. You can likely get a better price. You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so there is room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is below the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This offer reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

You should still reject the offer. While it's closer to your desired price, you can likely negotiate further. You're still willing to pay a significant amount more than Alice's minimum, so there's room to find a middle ground."
