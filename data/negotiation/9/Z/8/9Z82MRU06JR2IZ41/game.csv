"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. I believe this product will bring you a lot of value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $13,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is significantly below its value.  To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $11,000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $7,500 and see if we can close this out?",7500.0,Bob,6,
