Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum profit with Bob:** Since Bob values the product at $100, the maximum price he'd be willing to pay is just under $150 (to make it worthwhile for him).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice gets more than she would from John.
* **John as a backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides Alice with a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out."
