"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is unrealistic.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is respectful but clearly states that $18,000 is unacceptable.
* **Leaving Room for Movement:** Offering $9,000 is a significant jump down, but it keeps the negotiation alive and gives Alice space to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $13,500 is still significantly higher than John's offer. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to our $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Recognizing Alice's counter-offer helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Continuing to Negotiate:** By countering with $11,000, we are moving closer to our maximum budget while still leaving room for Alice to potentially come down a bit more.
* **Balancing Act:** This offer aims to find a price that's acceptable for both parties â€“ good for us, but not so low that Alice walks away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's try $12,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our acceptable price range, but we are still within our negotiation limits. There's no need to settle just yet. We'll continue with a counteroffer closer to John's price to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer proposes a price exactly halfway between Alice's last offer and our previous offer, signaling a strong desire to compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting this is a ""fair deal for both of us,"" we subtly introduce a bit of urgency without being overly pushy.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $11,500 keeps us below our $12,000 maximum while still leaving a little room for Alice to potentially negotiate further, albeit minimally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and offer $12,500. This is a good middle ground, and allows us to both get a decent deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut our losses. Alice seems to be very reluctant to go below $12,000. While we might be able to squeeze out a tiny bit more from Alice with further negotiation, it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price or the deal falling through. 

John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is significantly better than Alice's current offer. It's time to secure a good deal and move on."
