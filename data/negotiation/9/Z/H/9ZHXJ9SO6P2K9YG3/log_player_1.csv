"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $11,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, either.  I'll try to work something out with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is simply too low for me to accept. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

While $11,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  $11,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,250, which is a fair compromise.  It's a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12250}
