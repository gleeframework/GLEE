"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is a high-quality item that I believe you'll find very valuable, given its worth of $100 to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point of $100. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a possibility that she might be willing to lower her price to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product for $90, which I believe strikes a fair balance between the value I'm receiving and what you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but $90 is still outside your comfort zone. You can try to negotiate further.  There's a chance she may be willing to come down a bit more to secure the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $89 for the product. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while remaining competitive with your valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is within your budget of $100, and you've already rejected a lower offer of $88.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject any further counteroffers and you might end up buying from John for $100.  Accepting the offer at $89 is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
