Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, knowing that the product is worth at least $150 to me. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
$100 is too low for me. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hopefully finding a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price I can get from John.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
