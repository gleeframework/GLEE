"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's unique features and potential benefits, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's worth considering.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $650000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still think $725000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $700000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",700000.0,Bob,6,
