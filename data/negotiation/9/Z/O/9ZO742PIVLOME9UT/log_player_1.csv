Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible. I'll offer Bob the product for $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a significant amount. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I think he's being reasonable. However, I'm not willing to give up too much profit, so I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $900,000, which is a compromise between his offer and my initial offer.
