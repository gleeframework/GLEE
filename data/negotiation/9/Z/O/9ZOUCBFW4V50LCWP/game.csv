"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000.  The product is worth significantly more to me than that.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a compromise at $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
