"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to me, and considering its value, I believe it's worth more than $80 to you. Let's aim for a fair deal. Would you like to start by suggesting a price?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. To continue our discussion towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $90 for the product. This allows us some room while still valuing the product appropriately. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  This would allow us to both get a fair deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I would like to suggest a price of $89 for the product. This offers a slight increase from your last proposal, while still being reasonable for both of us. I hope this proposal works for you.",89.0,Alice,5,
