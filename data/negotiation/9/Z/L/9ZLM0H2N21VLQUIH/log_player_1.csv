"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This classic negotiation tactic leaves room for me to make concessions and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing its true worth to me.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point for discussions"" signals my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed win, but I believe I can get more from Bob with strategic negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 falls quite a bit short of what I had in mind.  To be fair, let's meet halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Firmly:**  I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express understanding for his position. However, I make it clear that his initial offer is too low.
* **Strategic Concession:** By meeting ""halfway"" from my initial high anchor of $1,600,000, it appears I'm making a significant concession. However, this price is still well above my minimum and keeps the negotiation moving in a positive direction.
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** I don't want to drop the price too drastically too quickly, as that could signal desperation or a lack of confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, the risk of him walking away is increasing. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John for $1,000,000."
