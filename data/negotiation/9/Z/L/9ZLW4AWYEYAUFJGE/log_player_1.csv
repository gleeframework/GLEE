Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested buyers. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to sell ourselves short. Starting with a higher price gives us room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.
* **Anchoring:**  By presenting a price of $20,000, we anchor Bob's perception of the product's value.  Even if he negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of a ""good deal.""
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. This allows us to be more assertive with Bob, knowing we have a fallback option.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential gain from a higher selling price outweighs the risk of losing him as a buyer, given our secured alternative."
