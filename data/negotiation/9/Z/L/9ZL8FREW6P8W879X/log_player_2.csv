Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $180 is my initial asking price, I could come down to $160. I'm confident you'll find that a fair price for the value you're getting.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $110 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $135 is tempting, it's still more than the $120 John is offering. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible and I'm not emotionally invested in buying from Alice specifically, it makes the most financial sense to go with John's offer."
