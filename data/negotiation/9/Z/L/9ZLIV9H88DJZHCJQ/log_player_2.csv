You can do better than $100. It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

You can still do better than $92. It's worth rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer, potentially aiming for a price closer to $85."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $90 for the product. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still in a better position by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. It's worth trying to get closer to your goal price of $80. You can aim for $85 or even $87, but be prepared to accept something close to your $80 limit if Alice won't budge."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87 and $90. How about we try $89? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you're only $1 away from your limit and have already rejected her last offer. It's time to stop negotiating and buy from John."
