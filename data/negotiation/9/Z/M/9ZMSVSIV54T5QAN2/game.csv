"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,500 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $9,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? I think this is a fair compromise that will let us both walk away happy.",10000.0,Alice,5,
