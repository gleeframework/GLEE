"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. ",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $11500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's make a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11500 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $12250? That's a fair price that's still a good deal for you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my budget.  However, $12250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is my absolute limit.  If you accept this, we can close the deal. ",12000.0,Bob,6,
