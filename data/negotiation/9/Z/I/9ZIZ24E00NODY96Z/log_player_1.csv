Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than his initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $95 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not willing to sell for less than $105 at this point. I'll see if I can push for that in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. $100 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for $105.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $98 is a bit closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for $105.  I've got a few rounds left and I think I can get him to come up a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 102}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $100 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the game, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $105. I've only got two rounds left, and I'm not sure I can push him further. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
