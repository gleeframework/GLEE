"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, as it's worth more than that to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $130 is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between Alice's offer and his ideal price.  He's demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's willing to negotiate. This counteroffer gives Alice room to come down a bit without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $115.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $122.5 is better than John's price, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. He's already shown he's willing to negotiate and has a clear target price in mind. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit too high at $122.50. How about $120? I'm very interested in buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's offer.  He's keeping the price just below the midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating he's taking her counteroffer seriously. He's also reminding her of his budget constraints, emphasizing that he's being realistic."
