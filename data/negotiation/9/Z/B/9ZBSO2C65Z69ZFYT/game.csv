"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe holds significant value. While I understand you may not know its full potential, I'm confident it has the potential to be extremely valuable for you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This price reflects the high value I place on the product, but I believe it offers you a considerable upside.  Please consider this offer carefully, as it's a one-time opportunity. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800000. ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
