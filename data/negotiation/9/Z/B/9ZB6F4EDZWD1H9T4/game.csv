"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the product's immense value and provides a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I acknowledge the product's value, $1,150,000 remains outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price is fair and allows for a healthy profit for you.  Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
