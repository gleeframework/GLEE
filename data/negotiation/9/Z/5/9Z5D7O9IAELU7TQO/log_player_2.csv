"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount considering its true value.  I know this is a great opportunity for you, but if you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay full price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly using pressure tactics by mentioning another buyer.  While her offer of $1,100,000 is below her stated value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer, or you can simply proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
