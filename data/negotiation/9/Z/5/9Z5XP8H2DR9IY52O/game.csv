"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $110 for it.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $155 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could go down to $140, but that's my absolute lowest.",140.0,Alice,5,
