Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum price:**  $140 is higher than your $120 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $140 is below Bob's $150 value, leaving room for potential negotiation. 

By starting high but leaving room for compromise, you maximize your potential earnings while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I think I can offer you $130 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer of $140.  By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:** You demonstrate that you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Potentially increase the final price:**  By rejecting his offer, you might push him to increase his counteroffer in the next round.

However, be mindful of John's offer. If the negotiation with Bob drags on for too long, you might need to reconsider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I'm still not able to go above $130. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $132 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum of $120, and you're likely to earn more by accepting this offer than by selling to John.  

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Close to your desired price:** You're only $3 away from your initial offer of $135. 
* **Avoids potential delays:** Continuing the negotiation might lead to more back-and-forth, possibly dragging on and increasing the risk that Bob will lose interest.
* **Minimizes risk:**  While John's offer is a safety net, there's no guarantee you'll find another buyer who will pay more than Bob's current offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure a good price and finalize the sale without unnecessary risks."
