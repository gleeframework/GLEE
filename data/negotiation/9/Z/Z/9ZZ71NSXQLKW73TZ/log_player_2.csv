"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is good, it's still above Bob's target of $15,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get a quick deal at a lower price. He's aiming to be aggressive while still being within a reasonable range, considering the product's value to him. This strategy could potentially trigger a quick agreement or push Alice to counter with a more competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about $13,000? It's still a great deal for you and gives us both some room to compromise. Let's keep talking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $13,000. While Alice has moved closer to his target, he believes there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue exploring a lower price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're not ready to go as low as $12,000 yet.  I'm still very interested in the product and willing to pay $12,500.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a slight concession by moving up from $12,000 to $12,500. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. He's also emphasizing a ""fair price for both of us"", appealing to Alice's sense of reason and potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
