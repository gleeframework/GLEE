{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:** $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** $12,000 is less than your minimum value, ensuring you don't sell below your acceptable threshold.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It allows for a back-and-forth without feeling extreme.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000 and even less than my initial offer of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to go up to $9,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough for me. I'm going to counteroffer one more time, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle at $10,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with it, I'll have to sell to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
