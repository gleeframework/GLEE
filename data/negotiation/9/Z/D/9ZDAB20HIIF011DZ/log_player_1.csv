"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
 **Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start the negotiation with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a favorable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $1,100,000 allows for some back-and-forth while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value and your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and your initial offer. Accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. You can try to meet in the middle.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer already reflects a willingness to negotiate. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,025,000. This price recognizes the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($900,000). 
* **Firm but Fair:** The language acknowledges Bob's offer while still conveying the value of the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This keeps the price above the $1,000,000 mark, making it more psychologically palatable to potentially concede a bit more in later rounds while still staying above your absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far apart from $1,025,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Bob is moving up, but slowly.  This suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Below Target:** $950,000 is still significantly below your $1,200,000 target.
* **Time for a Stronger Stance:** It's time to show more resistance to signal that you're not willing to go much lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is simply too far from what I consider a fair deal for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. It reflects the true value and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stand:** This counteroffer shows Bob you're serious about your bottom line.  
* **Small Concession:**  Dropping to $1,000,000 is a small concession but keeps you at a psychologically important round number.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value and potential ROI aims to sway Bob's thinking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I still think $1,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. Can we consider this a fair price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but he's still significantly below your $1,000,000 ""final offer.""  This suggests he's unlikely to meet your desired price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures you get your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure a favorable deal with John."
