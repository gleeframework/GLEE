"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate it, $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment.  How about $105? I'm sure we can find common ground.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $107.50. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your coming down a bit, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $106.25.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",106.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $108. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, so I'll meet you at $108.25. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",108.25,Alice,5,
