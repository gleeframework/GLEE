Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and potentially securing a deal with Bob before resorting to the backup option of selling to John."
