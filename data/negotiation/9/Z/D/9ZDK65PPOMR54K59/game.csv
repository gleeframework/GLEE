"Bob, I'm confident this product will be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,450,000.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth significantly more to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we discuss further?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $1,350,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and it allows me to recover some of my initial investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be reasonable. I'd like to meet you in the middle again, so how about we discuss $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,225,000 is closer to what I need, I'm still not quite there. To make this work, I'm offering a final price of $1,300,000.  It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer. I understand we are both trying to find a compromise.  To meet in the middle, I'm willing to accept $1,287,500. This would allow us both to walk away feeling like we've gotten a fair deal.  Let's wrap this up.",1287500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not sure if $1,287,500 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not comfortable with that amount. I'd like to propose a price of $1,275,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can meet at this price, I'm willing to move forward with the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
