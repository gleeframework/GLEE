"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value it brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget. I'm eager to close this deal, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can reasonably offer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints. I'm confident that this is a deal we can both agree on.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,000,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'd like to propose $1,030,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings to your business.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
