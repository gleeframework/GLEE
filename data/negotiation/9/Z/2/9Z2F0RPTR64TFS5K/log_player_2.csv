"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's within your budget, you can likely get a better price by negotiating. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget. I'm eager to close this deal, so let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still above my maximum acceptable price. I can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price point.  Buying from John at this stage would leave me with some extra funds, but I want to explore if I can save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can reasonably offer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints. I'm confident that this is a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,000,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'd like to propose $1,030,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is still above my budget. While we are getting closer, the risk of further negotiations failing is increasing.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John. It ensures I get the product and still save some money compared to Alice's latest offer."
