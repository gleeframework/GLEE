"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
