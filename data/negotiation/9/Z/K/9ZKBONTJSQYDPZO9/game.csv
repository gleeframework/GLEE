"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will still be valuable to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000 even. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm hoping we can close a deal at this point.",975000.0,Bob,6,
