"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. While negotiating might lead to a lower price, it also carries the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price, eliminating any risk or negotiation time."
