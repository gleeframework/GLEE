Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me ($15,000).  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $16,000?  It's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is my final offer,  let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum threshold of $15,000 and allows me to close the deal without having to risk selling to John for a lower price."
