"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value to you is undeniably high. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I value the product, $1,150,000 is still pushing my budget. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us and leaves room for a profitable sale for you.  Let's aim for a win-win situation.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but we need to find a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about $1,100,000? This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and ensures a profitable transaction for you. Let's close this deal now.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
