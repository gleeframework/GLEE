"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $130 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also ensures a fair return for us. I trust you'll find this offer attractive and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $130 is cheaper than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $100, meaning there's a chance to get it for less."
