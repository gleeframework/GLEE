"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for your consideration.  It's a valuable asset with a market value exceeding $1,000,000. I'm confident it will be a great acquisition for you.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to show Bob's seriousness in getting a good price.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the lower price, mentioning both value and budget, to make the counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Negotiation:** This sets the stage for further back-and-forth negotiations in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your desire for a good deal. While your offer is enticing, it's still below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Alice has reduced her offer, but it's still above Bob's target price. There's still room to push for a better deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps Bob in the driver's seat and allows him to continue negotiating.
* **Aiming for a lower price:** By rejecting, Bob can counteroffer at a lower price than $1,350,000, potentially reaching a more favorable outcome."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Reduction:**  This counteroffer is a small decrease from Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise but maintaining a firm stance.

* **Focus on Finality:**  The message emphasizes finalizing a deal, creating urgency and encouraging Alice to accept the offer."
