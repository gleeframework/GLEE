"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a quick deal.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum target price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach an agreement before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for improvement in the negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm further lowering my price to $11,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profits. I hope this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
