Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""its value,"" you subtly hint at the product's worth without explicitly revealing your minimum price.
* **Alternative Option:** By stating you'll list it publicly, you create a sense of urgency and imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. You don't have to explicitly mention John.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's reasonable considering the product's value to him."
