"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum price he's willing to pay, which is still lower than our minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing negotiations as we're unlikely to bridge the gap. Selling to John guarantees us our desired profit."
