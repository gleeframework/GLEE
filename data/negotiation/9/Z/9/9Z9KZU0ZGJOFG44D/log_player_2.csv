"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $180 is well above his budget of $100. He can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget is a bit tight, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $140 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown his willingness to walk away, so there's still room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $130. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to make a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to take another step towards you and offer it to you for $135. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down to $135, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He's already shown his willingness to walk away, and it seems unlikely Alice will go any lower.  John offers the product at Bob's budget, making this the best option."
