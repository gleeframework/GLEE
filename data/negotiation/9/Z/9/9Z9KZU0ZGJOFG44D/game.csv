,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget is a bit tight, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $130. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to consider my other options.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to take another step towards you and offer it to you for $135. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",135.0,Alice,5,
