"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $950000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820000. This amount reflects my assessment of the product's value to me. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $820000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $880000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860000.
