I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, we'll see what counteroffer he makes and adjust accordingly."

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low, and I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer but still above Bob's latest proposal. It shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product holds more value than $12,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. There are a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see what he proposes next."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations seem to have stalled. Bob is not willing to go higher, and I don't want to risk dropping too low. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still above my minimum and guarantees a sale."
