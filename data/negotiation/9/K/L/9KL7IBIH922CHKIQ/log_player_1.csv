Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Anchor:**  By setting a high initial price, I aim to influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  His response will reveal how interested he is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Leave Negotiation Space:**  Even if he rejects this initial offer, I have plenty of room to come down and still make a profit.

It's important to maintain a friendly and open tone to encourage a positive negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is closer to his true valuation, it's still significantly below both my minimum and what I could get from John.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about getting a fair price and keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This is a classic negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. While it's a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still a profit.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm not completely caving to Bob's offer, showing that I still believe in the product's value. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** If Bob is truly interested, he might counter again. This keeps the door open for a slightly higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but it's clear he's unlikely to meet my desired price point. Holding out for a higher offer from Bob has a risk: he might walk away entirely. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is a reasonable profit and avoids further negotiation. It's time to take the sure thing."
