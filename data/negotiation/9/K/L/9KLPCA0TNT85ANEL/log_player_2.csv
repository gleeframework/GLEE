"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to get the product for under $80. Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $75 is a good strategy. It shows Alice you are serious about buying but are also aiming for a significant discount. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately rejecting the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your target, you can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting and counter-offering again keeps the negotiation going and might push Alice closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by dropping her price. You can increase your counteroffer slightly to $78.  This demonstrates that you are willing to compromise but are still aiming for a price lower than $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is closer to your target price, but you're still within range of potentially getting a better deal.  Rejecting and counter-offering once more could lead to a final price closer to $80. It's worth trying one more round to see if you can squeeze out a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're only $5 away from your target price and John is offering the product for $80, it's time to push for a final price. You can offer $80 to see if Alice is willing to close the deal,  given that it's her floor price. If she rejects, you can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $82, which is very close to your goal, but still higher than John's offer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with only a few rounds left. You can confidently buy from John and secure the product at your target price."
