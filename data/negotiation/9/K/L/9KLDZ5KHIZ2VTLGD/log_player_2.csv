"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me."", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer (but still below your maximum budget) and leaves room for negotiation. By explaining that your offer reflects the product's value *to you*, you're emphasizing your perspective without directly attacking Alice's valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but it's still above your ideal price and what John offers.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for countering.  I understand your position and that this product holds significant value. To be frank, $1,000,000 is a little too high for my budget. I can go up to $700,000. I think this reflects a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Transparency:** You're being upfront about your budget limitations without completely revealing your hand. This can encourage Alice to be more realistic.
* **Movement:**  Showing willingness to increase your offer demonstrates your genuine interest while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Targeting a Compromise:** Aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's counteroffer encourages a collaborative approach towards a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm and this last offer is still above your absolute maximum. It's time to walk away and take John's offer. You'll save $100,000 and avoid potentially overpaying."
