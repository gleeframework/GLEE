Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Exploit Information:**  You know John will buy it for $12,000, providing a strong fallback option.
* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high gives room to negotiate if Bob tries to haggle. It also creates the perception of value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $11,999 is much higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), he might be willing to pay a premium if he believes the product is scarce or if he highly values your brand/reputation.
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can always decrease your price slightly, but don't go below your guaranteed sale price of $12,000 to John."
