"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,200, so I'll offer $10,600. Can you consider this offer?",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $10,600 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping you can see the value in this product and meet me halfway.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, which is the last concession I can make. Can you consider this offer?",10800.0,Bob,6,
