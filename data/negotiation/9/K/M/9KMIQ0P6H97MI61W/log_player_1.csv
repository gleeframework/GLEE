Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good profit. It's also closer to his counteroffer, increasing the chances he'll accept."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob has rejected my counteroffers and is stuck at $1,050,000.  While that's still a decent profit, I'm not confident I can push him further in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
