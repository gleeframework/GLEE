Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, it's always best to try for the highest possible profit. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below that wouldn't make sense.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle, still giving Alice a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties encourages Bob to act quickly and seriously consider the offer."
