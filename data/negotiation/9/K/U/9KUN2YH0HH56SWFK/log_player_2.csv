Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price closer to his target.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and allows for potential further concessions from Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than her initial asking price and closer to Bob's target of $1,000,000. While continuing to negotiate could potentially yield a lower price, it risks losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further delays or potential higher costs."
