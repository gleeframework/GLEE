"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be a valuable asset to your business. I've priced it at $1,200,000, which reflects its high quality and potential. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to show you my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. This price still offers you a significant return on investment, and it's a fair compromise given the product's unique benefits.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget constraints. I'm confident that this price is still a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000. However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price still offers you a substantial return on your investment and allows me to get closer to my target. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution, but $925,000 still falls short of my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 as a final compromise. This price still represents a fantastic value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
