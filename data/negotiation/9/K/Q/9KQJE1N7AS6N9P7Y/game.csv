"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a little ways off. How about $9,500? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to get this unique item.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close.  I'm willing to move up a little bit to $10,500 if we can close the deal now.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,500, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,750. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Alice,7,
