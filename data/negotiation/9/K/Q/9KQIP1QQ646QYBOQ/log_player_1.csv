Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, but am open to discussing the price."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you the chance to potentially earn more.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will reveal how interested he is in the product. If he outright rejects it, we can assume he's price-sensitive. If he counters, we know he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, we're not risking a loss by starting high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you value a quick sale, you could adjust the initial offer downwards."
