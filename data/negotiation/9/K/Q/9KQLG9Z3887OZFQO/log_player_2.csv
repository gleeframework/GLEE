"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $999,000 is a great price, but there's always potential to negotiate further.  I want to see if I can get an even better deal from Alice before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.  $950,000 is still a good price for me, but it also gives Alice some wiggle room to accept without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $975,000 is still a good price, but I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Alice.  My counteroffer in round 2 was close, and I think there's a good chance she might be willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 960000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise and demonstrates my commitment to getting a deal done.  $960,000 is still a very good price for me, but it also leaves Alice with a bit of room to negotiate if she needs to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $970,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer.  At this point, I don't want to risk going back and forth further and potentially losing the deal.  While I could try to negotiate a bit lower, it's unlikely she'll budge much more, and the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing a good deal.  $970,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's price."
