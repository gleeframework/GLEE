"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to come down to $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend. Let's try $95. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we try $102? It's still a good profit for me, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",102.0,Alice,5,
