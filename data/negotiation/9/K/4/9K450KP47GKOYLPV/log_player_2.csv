"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round to make a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product for $13500. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Since Bob wants to save as much as possible, it's still better to reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to purchase at $12,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm now willing to sell the product for $13000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $13,000,  Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible.  He can still potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  Since he has the option to buy from John for $12,000, there's no immediate pressure to accept.  He can make a counteroffer in the next round and see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not there. How about $12,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm now willing to sell the product for $13250. Let's see if we can get close to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still higher than Bob's target price.  While he could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's no guarantee he'll be able to get a better offer.

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to go with the guaranteed price of $12,000 from John.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further risk of losing the deal with Alice."
