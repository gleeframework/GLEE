"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $105? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that would still give you a great value on the product.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I'm trying to keep my spending under $100.  Would you be willing to do $98?",98.0,Bob,6,
