"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
