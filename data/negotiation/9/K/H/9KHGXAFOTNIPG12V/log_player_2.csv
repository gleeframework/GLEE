"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive but not the best deal.** While $9,500 is a significant discount from John's price, there's still room for potential savings. 
* **Negotiation is worth pursuing.** The goal is to get the lowest possible price, and rejecting the initial offer opens the door to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $1,500 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant drop, but it's still within the realm of what she might be willing to accept, especially if she's eager to sell.
* **Room for compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves space for Alice to counter with a price closer to her own desired value, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a slight improvement, but still not ideal.** While closer to my target, it's still above my initial counteroffer, indicating she might be willing to go lower.
* **Further negotiation is worth trying.** I have several rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  My previous counteroffer was rejected, so I'm raising it slightly to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Showing flexibility:** This indicates I'm willing to compromise and helps keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Still within my budget:**  $8,500 remains significantly lower than John's price, making it a worthwhile deal if Alice agrees."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now very close to my target price.**  $9,000 is only $500 more than my last counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation is risky.**  We're at round 5, meaning I have limited rounds left. If I reject this offer and Alice doesn't budge, I might be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **It's a good deal.**  $9,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's price, making it a worthwhile purchase."
