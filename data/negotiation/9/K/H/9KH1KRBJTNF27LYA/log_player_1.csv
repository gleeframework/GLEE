Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed offer from John, our goal is to maximize profit. Offering the product to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially earn $400,000 more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **For Bob:** He gets the product for $400,000 less than its actual worth to him.
    * **For Alice:** She earns $100,000 more than John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential return on investment, justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject this offer. However, the potential reward of a significantly higher profit makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
