Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this offer stands as a testament to my hope for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could yield a quicker sale and still net a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is a strong offer that's:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), giving us negotiation room.
    * Attractive enough to potentially sway Bob, as it's a $1,000 discount from our backup offer.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language to highlight value and encourage acceptance. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice might adjust the price slightly."
