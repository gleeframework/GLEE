"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum valuation of the product. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $60, we are setting a low anchor point for the negotiation. While this is far from Alice's asking price, it might influence her to consider lower counteroffers. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first counteroffer is also about understanding how much Alice is willing to negotiate.  Her response will tell us a lot about the potential for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has come down significantly, $100 is still above both your budget and your maximum valuation of the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John is an Option:**  You still have the safety net of buying from John at $80 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $100 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $70? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer, but not dramatically. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still staying below our $80 limit.
* **Justification:**  By saying ""$100 is still a bit more than I had in mind,"" we're implying a budget constraint without explicitly revealing our maximum price. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** $70 represents a price closer to the middle ground between Alice's initial offer and our initial counteroffer. This could potentially lead to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer it to you for $110. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Alice has barely moved from her previous offer, and it's clear she's not willing to go much lower than $110.
* **Above Budget:**  $110 is still above your maximum budget of $80 and your maximum valuation of the product. 
* **John is the Better Option:**  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're comfortable with. Buying from John for $80 ensures you get the product within your budget."
