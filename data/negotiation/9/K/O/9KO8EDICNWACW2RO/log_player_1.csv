Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but only if it's within a more reasonable range. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $12,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. While getting closer to John's offer, there's room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm sensing we're getting closer to a number we can both agree on. Would you consider $15,500? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 15500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  To be honest, $13,000 is the highest I can go.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $13,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $5,000 over Bob's perceived value and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds, forcing us to sell to John for $15,000."
