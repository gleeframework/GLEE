"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $180 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $120 is quite low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $120."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
