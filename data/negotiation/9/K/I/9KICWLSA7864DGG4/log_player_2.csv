"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I think you'll agree that this is a fair and competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also lower than the value you place on the product ($1,500,000).  Accepting her offer allows you to save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
