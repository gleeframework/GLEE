"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm still interested in the product, $7,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $6,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal then.",6750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",6900.0,Alice,5,
