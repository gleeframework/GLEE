Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 benefits both of you. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts. Aiming slightly below his maximum value increases the chance he'll see it as a great deal and accept immediately.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm prepared to offer it at a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Confident:** The message is direct and positions the product as valuable.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $50,000, making it a very attractive offer for him.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will try to negotiate further. Be prepared to slightly adjust your price or hold firm depending on his counter-offer and your risk tolerance."
