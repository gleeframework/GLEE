Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for room to negotiate while still leaving a significant profit margin for myself. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob if he doesn't accept this offer. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and my perceived value of the product. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still leaves a considerable profit margin for me. I believe this price is fair and reasonable considering Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price and still above the $1,000,000 I'd get from selling to John.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
