Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and even my own minimum, I leave room for negotiation while aiming for a potential windfall. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high with Bob, I always have the option to walk away and accept John's offer if the negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2,300,000. I would like to propose an alternative that aligns more closely with what I am able to offer. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of a substantial loss.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle while still staying above my $1,500,000 baseline."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your budget constraints, the $2,300,000 price tag reflects the true value and potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  It's good negotiation practice to acknowledge Bob's counteroffer, showing him that I respect his position.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my higher price point. 
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial offer ($400,000) to demonstrate flexibility. However, I'm still aiming significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price.
* **""Compromise"" Language:** Framing the offer as a ""compromise"" helps manage Bob's expectations and encourages him to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered it carefully, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. I am still committed to finding a solution within my budget. My latest counteroffer is $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer is $100,000 above my minimum selling price to John. While I could push for more in another round, there's a risk Bob will drop his offer or walk away entirely. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the potential loss of the deal."
