Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation.

**Why a Deal is Unlikely**

You cannot offer a price below $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. Bob is not willing to pay more than $1,200,000. 

**Possible Strategies**

While a deal seems impossible, here are a couple of things you could try:

1. **Understanding Bob's Needs:** Perhaps there are intangible benefits the product offers Bob that you're not aware of.  Exploring these might uncover hidden value for him, potentially pushing his valuation closer to yours.

2. **Future Considerations:** You could offer Bob the product at his price ($1,200,000) in exchange for something else, like a future favor, a stake in one of his ventures, or access to his network. This assumes Bob has something valuable to offer in return.

**The Offer (Given the Constraints)**

Given the lack of information about Bob's potential additional value for the product, the most logical offer is to aim high, knowing you have a backup buyer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **High Price:** This price is significantly above Bob's valuation, making it likely he'll reject it.
* **Justification:** The message attempts to justify the high price by highlighting ""unique value and potential,"" but without specifics, it might not be persuasive.

**Outcome:** You will likely proceed to sell the product to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000."
