"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That way we both get a fair deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $12,250.  Let's try to close this deal.",12250.0,Bob,4,
