"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's best to reject and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but need to stay within my $1,000,000 limit. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This shows a genuine interest and is a starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the product's true value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's come down, it's still above my budget.  I'll counter again and see if we can reach a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm committed to acquiring this product but need to stay close to my $1,000,000 limit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This shows a genuine desire to close the deal, and it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
