Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 to be made (Bob's value - your minimum).

**The Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Recognizing its significant value to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a win-win, allowing you to benefit while I receive a fair return."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""win-win"" nature of the deal.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (enough incentive), while you secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to leave room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a strong relationship with Bob is paramount, a more generous offer might be considered. 

**Remember:** This is just one approach.  The best offer depends on your risk tolerance and any additional information you might have about Bob's negotiating style."
