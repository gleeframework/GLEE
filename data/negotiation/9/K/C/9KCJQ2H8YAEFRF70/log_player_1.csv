Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value Bob would get by stating his perceived worth.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for several rounds of negotiation before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is higher to you, but based on my assessment, I am only willing to pay $9,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown some flexibility in his offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Move:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still allows you a significant discount from my initial price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Close to My Minimum:** This offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving Bob a good discount but still ensuring I make a decent profit.
* **Show Flexibility:** By lowering my offer, I demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still above Bob's offer, keeping some leverage for further negotiation.
* **Encouraging Compromise:** I emphasize finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to come closer to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Based on my assessment, I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Middle Ground:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly the middle ground between our last two offers. It's a good compromise that is still profitable for me.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away or potentially lowering his offer further.  
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process, and I could potentially lose John as a buyer.

While I would prefer to sell for closer to $12,000, accepting this offer is the most pragmatic choice considering the potential for losing both Bob and John as buyers."
