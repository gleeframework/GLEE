Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a rare find and I'm confident it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point above my minimum value of $12,000. It leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob. This is meant to pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation and will be prepared to counter Bob's offers if necessary. However, I have a fallback option with John, which allows me to set a firm lower limit on my acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $14,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for it. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? It's a fair price considering the unique value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping my price above $15,000. This shows flexibility while trying to maximize my profit. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and reiterates the value of the product. It also acknowledges Bob's initial offer and suggests a compromise. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary. This keeps the pressure on Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's unique value, but $16000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is only $1,500 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Given that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a higher profit. It's also likely that further negotiation would not yield a significantly higher price."
