{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great value for you.  I'm asking $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting high, but I'm open to negotiation.  I know John is willing to pay $150, so I have a bit of room to work with.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is interesting, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't go below $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested!  I'm not quite ready to go down to $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $140?  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident that we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to secure the sale with John at $150."
