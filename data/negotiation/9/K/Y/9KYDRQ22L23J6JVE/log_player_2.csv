"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500?  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is closer to his limit, he can still get the product for $10,000 from John. There's no reason to accept a higher price when he has a cheaper option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,250. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
