"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I can still potentially negotiate a lower price, so I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's still below Alice's offer, but closer to her previous position.  This shows a genuine attempt to meet halfway and encourages further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's meet halfway! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still above my budget. While we're getting closer, the negotiation process seems to be moving slowly. The risk of not closing the deal with Alice and losing more time is too high. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at a guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
