**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is now within our budget and represents a good deal compared to John's price of $12,000. Accepting the offer secures the product at a favorable price.  It's important to weigh the risk of further negotiation versus the potential for getting a better deal.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of success and we could end up with a worse outcome.  It's a good time to lock in the deal."
