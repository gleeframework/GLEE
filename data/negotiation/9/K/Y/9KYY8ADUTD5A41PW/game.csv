"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will bring you great value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.  Let's make a deal!",850000.0,Alice,3,
