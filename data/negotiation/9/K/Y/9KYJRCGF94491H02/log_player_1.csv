Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell for $900,000, as it is below my minimum price. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to show good faith. This still reflects the value of the product to you. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be able to make a profit on this deal. Can we talk about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer of $950,000. It's closer to my minimum price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's really my absolute lowest.  This product is extremely valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll be able to generate a substantial return on your investment. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. Can we talk about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is not budging on his offer, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  it's getting risky to keep negotiating. I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale."
