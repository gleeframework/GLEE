"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 simply wouldn't cover the value of this product for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a great deal. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get it for $950000. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
