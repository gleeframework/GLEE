"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount considering you value the product at $150. You can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice values the product at $120, offering $125 is a fair starting point for negotiation. It's a reasonable compromise that shows you're willing to pay a fair price, but also leaves room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have more rounds to negotiate, and you can still potentially get a better price. It's worth trying to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $140, and you are willing to pay up to $150.  Offering $130 is a compromise that shows you're serious about buying the product, but you're still trying to get a better price. This gives Alice a chance to come down a bit further, and you can still potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is closer to your budget, it's still a significant amount, and you have more rounds to negotiate. You're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price, but it's worth trying to counteroffer one more time to see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps going up in price, but you've already offered $130 and she rejected it.  Offering $135 is a compromise that shows you're willing to meet her halfway.  This might be the best you can get, but you still have some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is exactly the price you're willing to pay for the product. However, you have already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has consistently rejected them, demonstrating a lack of willingness to compromise.  At this point, you have three rounds left, and it's unlikely that you will be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 

Given that you have a guaranteed alternative with John at the same price, it's more efficient to go ahead and buy the product from John. This ensures that you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation that is unlikely to be successful."
