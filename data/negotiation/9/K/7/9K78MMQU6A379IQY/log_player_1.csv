"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a good starting point.  It's higher than my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will be interested.  We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. Hopefully Bob will see this as a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $125. While I would prefer more, it's a decent price, and we're already in round 4.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
