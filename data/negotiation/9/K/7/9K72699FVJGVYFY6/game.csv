"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for it. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,250. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit steep. I'm prepared to offer $12,750. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet on the price.  How about $12,875?  It's a small step closer to your last offer, and I think it's a good starting point for us to find a solution we're both happy with.",12875.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a slightly firmer offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,100. What do you think?",13100.0,Alice,7,
