Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know John exists or that you have a guaranteed sale. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you know his valuation, you have a strong negotiating position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're starting with a strong and confident offer that's significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number. You're vaguely alluding to the product's ""unique value"" to justify the higher price.
* **Exclusivity:**  The word ""exclusive"" subtly implies scarcity and competition, even if Bob has no reason to believe others are interested. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher to allow room for negotiation. 
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** The higher you aim, the greater the chance Bob rejects the offer, and you end up with your guaranteed $800,000.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
