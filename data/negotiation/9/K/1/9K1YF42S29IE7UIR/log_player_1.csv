Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000 (this is what I'd get from John)
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $10,000
* **Offer:** $14,000 - This is a compromise that is still profitable for me, and potentially attractive enough for Bob to consider.

**Reasoning:**

By offering $14,000, I'm leaving some room for negotiation, while still ensuring a profit for myself. This strategy is based on the idea that Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his initial valuation if it means securing the product."
