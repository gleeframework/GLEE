,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob.  However, the value of this product is quite high, and $10,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $10,200? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  $10,200 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider this my final offer.",10300.0,Bob,6,
