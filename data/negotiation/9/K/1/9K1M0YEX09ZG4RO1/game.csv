"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $950,000. I believe this represents excellent value, considering the worth you place on it. While I'm confident this is a fair price, I understand you may have other considerations. I'm willing to discuss further, so feel free to counter-offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be selling to another buyer for a lower price.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
