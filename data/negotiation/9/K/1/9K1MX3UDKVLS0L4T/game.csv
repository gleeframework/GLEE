"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $10,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's try to find a compromise!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
