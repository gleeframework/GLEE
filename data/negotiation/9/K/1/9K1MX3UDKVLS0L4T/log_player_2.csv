"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. He has 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $10,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). This shows good faith and sets the stage for a reasonable negotiation. 
* **Leaving room:** This counteroffer still leaves room for negotiation, allowing Alice to counter back without feeling like she's giving away too much.  
* **Goal:** Bob wants to get the price down as much as possible, but he also doesn't want to risk losing the deal. This offer balances those two objectives."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's try to find a compromise! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Goal:** Bob wants to get the price as low as possible.  He's still aiming for a price closer to $8,500.
* **Rounds Remaining:** With 7 rounds left, there's time to continue negotiating without rushing into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is proposing a compromise that is halfway between his last offer and Alice's offer. This shows that he is willing to meet in the middle.
* **Fairness:**  Bob is highlighting the fairness of the offer for both parties. 
* **Closing the deal:** Bob emphasizes his desire to reach an agreement and close the deal."
