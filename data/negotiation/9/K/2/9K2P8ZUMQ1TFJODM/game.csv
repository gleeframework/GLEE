"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $900,000 for this product. This is still a great price for you, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
