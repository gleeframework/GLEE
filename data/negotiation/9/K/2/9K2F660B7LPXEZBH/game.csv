"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $80? Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $80 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to buy from John at $80 if this doesn't work out.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $105. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",105.0,Alice,5,
