Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Create Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to decide quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept. If he rejects it, I'm happy to sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
