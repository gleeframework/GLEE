"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a backup option with John, so you're not in a rush to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer, aiming to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. My goal is to get the product as close to my maximum budget as possible, and I believe $1,000,000 is a reasonable starting point.  This is also the price of my backup option, so it's my minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, though closer than before. I'm still willing to negotiate further. I can afford to reject the offer since I have the option of buying from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,250,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price below $1,500,000. I'm hoping that Alice sees this as a reasonable middle ground and is willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above my target price of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer. Given the back-and-forth negotiation, I'm not sure how much lower I can push Alice, and it's likely that further rounds will take more time.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and secure the product, rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up having to buy from John at $1,000,000 anyway."
