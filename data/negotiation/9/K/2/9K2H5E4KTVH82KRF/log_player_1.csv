{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal considering its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's potential value. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  $800,000 is simply unacceptable. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I have a budget to stick to. Could we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
