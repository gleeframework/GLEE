"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
