Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.

While Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is getting close to John's price, it's still more than I need to spend. I can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal at this point."
