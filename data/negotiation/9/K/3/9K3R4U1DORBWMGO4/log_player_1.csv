Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, meaning you'll earn a decent profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $120 is still less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him a good incentive to buy. 
* **It minimizes risk:**  If Bob rejects, you still have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing you at least $80."
