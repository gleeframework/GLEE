Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $13000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my previous proposal of $13000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell to John.  Bob has repeatedly stuck to his $13,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $13,500. John's offer of $15,000 is a much better deal for me, and I'm happy to close the deal with him."
