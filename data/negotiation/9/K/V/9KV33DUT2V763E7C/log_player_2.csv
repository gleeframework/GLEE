"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice wants at least $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's room for negotiation because the difference between their desired prices is $2,000.

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob can try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** Bob is offering $10,500, which is right in the middle of his maximum price and Alice's minimum price. This signals a willingness to negotiate but also shows that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.
* **Maximizing Savings:**  By starting with a lower counteroffer, Bob increases the chances of reaching an agreement while still potentially saving a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price. It's still above Bob's ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from the initial $11,500.  Here's why accepting is the best strategy:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will either refuse further offers or raise her price again.  
* **Saving Money:**  Accepting saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John, which is a considerable savings. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  By accepting, Bob builds a good relationship with Alice, which could be beneficial for future potential transactions."
