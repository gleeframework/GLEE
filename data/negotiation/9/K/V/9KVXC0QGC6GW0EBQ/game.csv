"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, my budget doesn't allow me to go above $800,000 at this time. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price within that range. Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
