"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth more to you than that. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a fallback option with John at $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might be bluffing about the other buyer and could be willing to lower the price. By rejecting, you might be able to negotiate a better deal and save even more money."
