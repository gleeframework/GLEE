"Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, considering my budget and the market value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
