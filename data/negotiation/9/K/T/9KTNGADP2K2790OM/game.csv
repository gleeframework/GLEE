"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a fair price for both of us - it's significantly closer to your asking price than my initial offer, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000 and its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
