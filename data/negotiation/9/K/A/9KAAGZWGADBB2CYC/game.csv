"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
