"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, and I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
