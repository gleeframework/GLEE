"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm offering it to you for a price of $1,250,000.  This price is a significant discount considering its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price point that benefits us both.  Let me know your thoughts!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant discount from her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  You stand to save $250,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with your backup option."
