"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $6,500 is a little too low for me.  How about $8,500? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $7,250 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference at $7,750?  That's a fair price for both of us.",7750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up a bit to $7,500.  This is my final offer, so take it or leave it.",7500.0,Bob,6,
