"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

It's still more than Bob is willing to pay. Bob should try to negotiate further."

Bob has a clear limit of $10,000 for this product. While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's threshold. It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $10,000."
