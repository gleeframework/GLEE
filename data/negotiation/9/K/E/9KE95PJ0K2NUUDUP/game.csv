"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $9000? This would allow both of us to walk away happy.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $9000. How about $8500? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $8500 is still not enough. I'm willing to drop my price a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting closer to my minimum.  Let's split the difference again. How about $8750? I believe this is a fair offer for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your minimum, but $8750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. How about $8250? I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,6,
