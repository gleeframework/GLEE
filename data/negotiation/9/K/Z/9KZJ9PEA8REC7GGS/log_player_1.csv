I'm starting with the highest possible price I'm willing to accept, as I know John will pay that much. I'm hoping Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my minimum price of $120 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a price of $115. This is a compromise, as I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still trying to get as close to my minimum price as possible."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
``` 

I'm offering $112, splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to buy, as I don't want to risk losing too much time and potentially losing the sale to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The negotiations have gone on for a few rounds and while Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it seems he's not willing to go any higher. To avoid further delays and ensure I get a reasonable price, I will sell the product to John for $120."
