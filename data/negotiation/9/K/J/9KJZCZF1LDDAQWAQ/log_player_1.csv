Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're committed to getting a fair value, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm getting closer to a number that works for both of us.  However, $900,000 still falls a little short of what I need.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $915,000. This is my absolute limit, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $915,000 is within a reasonable range. Considering I have only 4 rounds left, it's better to secure this deal rather than risk further negotiations and potentially lose out on the opportunity. This offer is significantly higher than what Bob initially offered and also provides me with a profit.  It's a good balance of getting a decent price and closing the deal within a reasonable timeframe."
