{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation and gives you the chance to see if he's serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $950000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a significant savings compared to other options, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to propose a price of $1050000 for your product. This allows me to stay within my budget while also providing a reasonable return for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll counteroffer Bob again."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.  This gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to my desired amount. Let's close this deal, it's a win-win for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I am willing to compromise further and propose a final price of $1075000 for your product. This price allows me to stay within my budget while still providing a fair return for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm confident John will buy my product for $1,500,000.  There's no reason to risk a deal that guarantees my desired profit."
