"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This still gives you a significant savings compared to other options, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
