You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a better deal than $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This will likely be rejected by Alice, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it. There's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but I'm still trying to stay under my maximum budget. This counteroffer should be close enough to Alice's last offer that she might be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is playing a game of pennies here. It's clear she's not willing to budge on the price significantly.  Given that I'm just one dollar over my maximum budget, it's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
