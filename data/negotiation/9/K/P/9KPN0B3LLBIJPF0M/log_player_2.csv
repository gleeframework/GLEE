Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,100,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing it further if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**  

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000, and she's made it clear this is her final offer. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
