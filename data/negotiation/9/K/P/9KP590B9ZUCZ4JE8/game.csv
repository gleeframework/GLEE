"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to keep the cost down.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a good deal considering its value to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $10,250? I'm trying to stay within my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still looking to get $10,500 for the product. I understand you're working with a budget, but this price gives you a good value for the product and helps me get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm prepared to lower my price to $10,350. This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",10350.0,Alice,7,
