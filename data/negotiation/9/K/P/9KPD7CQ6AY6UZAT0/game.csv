"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
