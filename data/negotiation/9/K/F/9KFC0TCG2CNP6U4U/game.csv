"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable,  I'm thinking a price closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I see your point about the value,  $1,400,000 is still a bit steep. How about we settle at $1,250,000? I think that's a fair offer considering both our positions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm proposing a price of $1,380,000. This is a compromise that I believe is closer to your true value, while still being a fair offer. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to bump my offer up a little, but I need to see some movement on your end too. How about $1,300,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm proposing a price of $1,320,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,7,
