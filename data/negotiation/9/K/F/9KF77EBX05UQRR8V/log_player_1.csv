Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** A positive and friendly approach can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief justification for the price helps make it seem reasonable.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've earned a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $15,000."
