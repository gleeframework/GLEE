"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth $140 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $120.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. However, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer. He's showing he's serious about buying the product, but he's also trying to get a price that's closer to Alice's value.  This allows for some room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $135 for the product? Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and only slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer of $130.  Given the limited rounds, accepting this offer is a good compromise. Bob saves $15 compared to buying from John."
