Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is the price John is willing to pay, so I know I can always walk away and sell to him. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate, but I won't budge below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd love to sell the product, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $14,000. This is a significant compromise from my original offer, but still higher than what Bob offered. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
