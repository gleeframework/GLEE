Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  However, I'm leaving myself the option to sell to John if Bob's counteroffer isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above the $1,200,000 mark that Bob offered. I'm hoping that this will incentivize Bob to compromise a bit more without driving him to reject the offer outright.  This gives us both a chance to find a price we're happy with before I resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, and I'm not sure I can push for much more without risking him walking away completely.  $1,250,000 is a good price, considering my minimum was $1,000,000."
