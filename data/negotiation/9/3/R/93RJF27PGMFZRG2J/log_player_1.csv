**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly rooted in the $940,000 - $950,000 range and is unlikely to move significantly closer to my $1,000,000 valuation.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Continuing with Bob at this point carries the risk of the deal falling through entirely or settling for a price I'm not comfortable with."
