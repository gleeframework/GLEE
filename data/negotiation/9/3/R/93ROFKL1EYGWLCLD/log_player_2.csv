"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $13,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's minimum price.  There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $12,800. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum:** $12,800 is only $800 more than Bob's maximum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:** Buying from John for $15,000 is significantly more expensive than accepting Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to get the product at a reasonable price while minimizing risk."
