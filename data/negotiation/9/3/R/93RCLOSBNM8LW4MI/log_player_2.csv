"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You are indifferent between accepting Alice's offer and buying from John, as both options cost you the same amount. However, the prompt states that your goal is to save as much money as possible, so buying from John is not a better option.  Since there's no benefit to either choice, you might as well buy from John."
