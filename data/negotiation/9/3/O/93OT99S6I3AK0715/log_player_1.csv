Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my maximum offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a substantial compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can't go higher than $1,400,000. This offer represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's potential. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a reasonable price. While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob, potentially exceeding John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I believe this represents a significant concession on my part and a fair price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are making progress, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but I can't go any higher. This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met John's offer of $1,500,000. It's unlikely Bob will go any higher, and there's no guarantee we can get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome."
