Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm asking for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay anything below that.
* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing you have a backup offer from John at $8,000.
* **Negotiating Power:** You have the advantage as you have another buyer.
* **Target Price:** Aiming high with $12,000 allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle above your minimum while leaving him with some perceived savings."
