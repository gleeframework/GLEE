"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows for the negotiation to begin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20% off) is a good strategy. It shows Alice you're serious about buying but also sets a lower starting point for negotiation. This gives Alice room to counteroffer without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  Accepting the offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John and gets you the product without risking further negotiation rounds. There's always a chance Alice could lower her price further, but there's also a chance she might not, and you could end up with no deal.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward."
