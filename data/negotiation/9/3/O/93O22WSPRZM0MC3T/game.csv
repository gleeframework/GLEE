"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's split the difference and make this happen!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still really hoping to get this product for $80, but I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $95. If we can't meet in the middle there, I'll have to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,6,
