"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get an even better price, especially since the product is worth $8,000 to him. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the competitive price. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good profit for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price of $7,500 to $7,250, which is a reasonable compromise.  Bob can save $750 compared to buying from John, making this a good deal. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the product and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
