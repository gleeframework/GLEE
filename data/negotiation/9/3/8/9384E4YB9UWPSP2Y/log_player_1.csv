"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident that the value you'll derive from it will far exceed the price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a good starting point. It's aggressive but within the realm of potential negotiation. I'm highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since I have several rounds left. I want to see if Bob is truly committed to buying the product and willing to raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This price allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that the product will be worth it to me, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can secure a higher price, potentially even closer to my initial offer. It's crucial to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. How about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. It's a win-win situation, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much, and the price is getting closer to my minimum. However, I am only 4 rounds away from the end of the negotiation, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale."
