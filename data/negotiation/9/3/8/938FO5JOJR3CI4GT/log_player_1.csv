Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you! I'm asking for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This strategy aims high initially to test Bob's willingness to pay. Here's why:

* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price might make Bob perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  If Bob accepts, you get a significantly higher profit.
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects, you still have John willing to pay your minimum acceptable price."
