,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is still a competitive price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider that price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $800000. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing my own profit margins. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $795000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider that price?",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $795000 is a very close offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $805000. This is the last concession I can make without sacrificing my own profit margins. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",805000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your previous concession, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, as I mentioned before. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Can you consider this price?",795000.0,Bob,8,
