"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth the full $900000. Can you meet me at $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still higher than $750000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $825000. I'm willing to pay $775000, as I mentioned before. I'd like to see if we can meet at a price that's closer to that. Can you consider $785000?",785000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $785000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $815000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",815000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $815000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $795000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying the product from a competitor.",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer the product to you for $810000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've made a final offer of $795000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that buying from a competitor might be the better option for me. Can you confirm if this is your final price or if you're willing to meet me at $795000?",795000.0,Bob,8,
