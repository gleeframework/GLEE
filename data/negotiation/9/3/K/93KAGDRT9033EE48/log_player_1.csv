"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $13,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. That's still a good deal for you, given its value to you is $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm also prepared to walk away and buy from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to offer significantly more than $9,500. He knows John is an option for us and is using that as leverage.  Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price of $10,000, avoiding the risk of Bob's negotiations dragging on with little room for improvement."
