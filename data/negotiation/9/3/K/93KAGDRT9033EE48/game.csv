"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. That's still a good deal for you, given its value to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm also prepared to walk away and buy from John.",9500.0,Bob,4,
