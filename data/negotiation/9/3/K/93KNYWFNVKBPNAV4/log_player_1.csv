Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750, as I mentioned earlier. It's the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offers have stalled at $8,750 and I don't think he'll budge any further. It's better to sell to John and secure a much better price."
