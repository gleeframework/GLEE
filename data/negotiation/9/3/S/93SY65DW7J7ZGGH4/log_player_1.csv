"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and above Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value of the product and make it appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while giving Bob the impression that there's room for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still lower than my minimum desired price of $100.
* **Negotiation Space:**  I'm still within the first few rounds, so there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can secure a better price by counter-offering and pushing for a more favorable outcome. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the possibility of a higher price alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110 to make this work. Let's split the difference and get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm responding to Bob's offer by making a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm using the ""split the difference"" strategy, which is often seen as a fair compromise in negotiations.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the value of closing the deal.

This counter-offer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices while still ensuring I receive a price that meets my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, which would be $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum desired price.
* **No Further Gains:** There's little room for further negotiation at this point.  I can't realistically expect to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Equal Value:**  Selling to John would also yield $100. There's no financial advantage in choosing John over Bob at this moment. 

Since Bob has met my minimum, I'm choosing to accept his offer and close the deal to avoid potentially losing the sale in future rounds."
