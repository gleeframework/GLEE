"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make a deal that's still beneficial for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you can move to John and secure the product at a price that saves you $2,000."
