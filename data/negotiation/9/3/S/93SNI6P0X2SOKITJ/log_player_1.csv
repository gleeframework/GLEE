Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still landing you above your minimum. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker. 
* **Value Justification:** While brief, acknowledging the product's worth helps justify the price, even without specifics.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations. If you had more information, you could tailor your approach further."
