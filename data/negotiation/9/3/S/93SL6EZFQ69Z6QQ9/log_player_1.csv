"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the offer's fairness, we emphasize the product's value and set a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights the product's benefits to Bob, subtly reminding him of why he's interested. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:** His response will indicate how aggressively he's willing to negotiate.
2. **Establish a strong starting point:**  Even if Bob counters, we've anchored the negotiation closer to our desired price range.
3. **Leave room for concessions:**  We have flexibility to lower the price in subsequent rounds while remaining above our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm excited about its potential. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  We have room to push for a better price, especially since his offer is $100,000 below his perceived value. By rejecting and countering, we signal that we're aiming for a higher price point and encourage him to move closer to it. We're not yet at a point where selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most strategic option."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value. While $1,100,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle at $1,125,000? This reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to invest while reiterating our stance on the product's value. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  We meet Bob halfway between his offer ($1,100,000) and our previous price ($1,150,000). This shows flexibility and encourages him to reciprocate.
* **Justification:** We frame the compromise as a win-win, emphasizing fairness and our desire to reach a deal.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Maintain Momentum:**  We keep the negotiation moving forward by presenting a reasonable alternative.
2. **Test Bob's Flexibility:**  His response will reveal how committed he is to his initial offer. 
3. **Secure a Favorable Price:** We are still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum ($1,000,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below our target. While his latest offer is closer to his perceived value, we have the leverage to negotiate further.  We are not yet in a position where accepting his offer or selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most advantageous option. 

We will continue negotiating strategically to maximize our profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and recognize your desire to find common ground. To move this forward, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,105,000.  This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my commitment to closing this deal. I believe this offer represents a fair and mutually beneficial outcome for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1105000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We start by recognizing Bob's efforts, which helps maintain a positive negotiating environment.
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a smaller concession this round ($15,000) compared to our previous move ($25,000). This signals we're reaching the limit of our flexibility.
* **Finality and Urgency:** The language emphasizes this is a final effort (""willing to *consider*"") and hints at the alternative buyer (""mutually beneficial outcome""). 
* **Anchoring Above Minimum:**  While a concession, the $1,105,000 price point is still a significant gain over our $1,000,000 alternative.

This offer aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob to finalize:**  He's unlikely to secure a much lower price, and our tone suggests limited further movement.
2. **Avoid Stalemate:** We're still open to a deal, preventing Bob from disengaging out of frustration.
3. **Maximize Potential Profit:** We're maintaining a price point that significantly exceeds our backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not at the price I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,060,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer of $1,060,000. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, we've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant increase. Bob is consistently incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, indicating we're approaching his upper limit.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Bob or missing out on a favorable deal. Each round that passes brings the risk of Bob withdrawing or significantly lowering his offer.
* **Profitable Outcome:**  $1,060,000 is a substantial profit above our guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. Accepting secures a significant gain and avoids the potential loss of a deal altogether.

While we could push for a slightly higher price, it's strategically sound to accept a strong offer at this stage, capitalizing on a profitable outcome and ending negotiations on a positive note."
