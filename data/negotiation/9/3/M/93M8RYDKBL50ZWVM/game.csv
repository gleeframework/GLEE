"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1125000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial offer. While I'm interested,  $1125000 is still a bit more than I can justify.  I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, $900000 is still a significant discount from the initial offer, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
