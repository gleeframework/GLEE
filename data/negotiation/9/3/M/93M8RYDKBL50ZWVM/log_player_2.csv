"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's counteroffer is exactly half of Alice's price, establishing a starting point for negotiation.
* **Realistic Offer:** $750,000 is still within Bob's budget but demonstrates a significant willingness to negotiate.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message highlights a willingness to find a middle ground, signaling a potential for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1500000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1125000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,125,000 is still above Bob's desired budget of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially drive the price lower. 
* **John's Offer:**  By rejecting, Bob keeps the option to buy from John open if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a better result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial offer. While I'm interested,  $1,125,000 is still a bit more than I can justify.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  Bob's counteroffer is a smaller gap between his previous offer and Alice's, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Realistic Offer:** $900,000 is still within Bob's budget but close enough to his desired price point to potentially entice Alice.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message emphasizes Bob's willingness to make a compromise, encouraging Alice to reciprocate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, $900000 is still a significant discount from the initial offer, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not there:**  While $1,050,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $50,000 over his ideal price.
* **John's Option:**  Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so he's not desperate to accept this offer.
* **Continue Negotiation:**  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get Alice down to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is now at his maximum budget, making it clear this is his final offer.
* **Clear Message:** The message emphasizes that he's willing to pay the full price but won't go higher.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  This puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale, as Bob has the alternative of buying from John."
