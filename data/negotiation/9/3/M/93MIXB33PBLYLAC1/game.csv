"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $7,750?  I think that's a fair price.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,750 isn't quite there yet. Let's compromise at $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  How about $8,000? That's a very fair offer, and it avoids us dragging this out further.",8000.0,Bob,6,
