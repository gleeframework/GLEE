Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a strong fallback option with John at $12,000, so you're not desperate and can confidently aim high."
