"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $900,000 is still a big stretch for my budget.  To be honest, I have other options for this product, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'll offer you the product for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to, and $750,000 is just a bit outside of that range. If you're able to come down to $700,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore my other options, even though I prefer working with you.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'll offer you the product for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",725000.0,Alice,7,
