Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly. I'm always prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still confident I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit. If Bob is serious, he should be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial asking price, and I'm confident that this is the best deal I can get at this point.  While I'd love to push for more, the risk of losing the sale entirely and having to settle for John's offer is too high.  Accepting $1,250,000 secures a good profit and is a more  reliable outcome than continuing to negotiate."
