,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I really appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $115? Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $115 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $122.50? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $122.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to pay $118.75.  This feels like a fair compromise.",118.75,Bob,4,
