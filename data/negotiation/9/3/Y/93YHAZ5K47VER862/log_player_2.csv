**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price or walk away to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a price closer to your target. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but my budget simply doesn't allow me to go above $1,100,000. This price represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. Let me know if you're open to this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your commitment to acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,125,000 is closer to your desired price range, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, it's likely that further negotiations with Alice won't bring the price down to your acceptable range. It's more beneficial to take the guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000, ensuring you stay within your budget and acquire the product."
