"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. Considering its value to me is at least $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
