You can do better than $9,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $9,250 is still too high, and you can probably get it lower."

Alice has come back to her original offer of $9,000. You can either accept this and save $3,000 compared to buying from John, or you can continue negotiating, but there's a risk that she'll walk away or make a counteroffer that's even higher. At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best option."
