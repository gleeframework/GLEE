"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to go down to $15500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you. Let's make this happen.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $13750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $14250.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's make this happen.",14250.0,Alice,9,
