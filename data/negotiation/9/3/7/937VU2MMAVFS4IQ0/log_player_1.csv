Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $95. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than your target price. This gives you room to maneuver and appear flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $95 leaves room for potential counteroffers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""great price"" and ""fantastic deal,"" subtly nudging Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is better than your fallback option (selling to John for $80). However, it's still below your initial asking price, and there's potential to negotiate a slightly higher price. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $90, you're demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above Bob's offer.
* **Middle Ground:**  Meeting ""in the middle"" is a common negotiation tactic that can feel more agreeable to both parties. 
* **Justification:**  Phrasing it as a ""fair price for both of us"" reinforces the idea that this is a balanced and reasonable compromise."
