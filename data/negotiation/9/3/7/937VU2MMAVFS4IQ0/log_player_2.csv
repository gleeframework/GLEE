"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $95. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $100.  Rejecting Alice's offer of $95 gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

Alice has come down from $95 to $90. This is a better price than John's offer of $100, and it's still within your budget. Accepting this offer gets you the product for a good price."
