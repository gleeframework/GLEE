"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating with you, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,
