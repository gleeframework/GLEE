Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I open the sale to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John will pay the full price gives Alice bargaining power.
* **Reasonable Offer for Bob:** The offer is still significantly below Alice's minimum and provides a $150,000 gain for Bob. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to act quickly."
