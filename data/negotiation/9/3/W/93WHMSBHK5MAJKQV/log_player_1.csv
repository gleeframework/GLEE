Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can potentially still meet in the middle at a price above your minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 allows you to be more confident in aiming higher with Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
