Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it for $1,500,000 (John's price), there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to start significantly higher.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while staying above our minimum. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the price, you can gauge his counter-offer and decide if you want to move closer to his valuation or stick closer to your guaranteed sale with John."
