Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000? I'm willing to make a serious offer and would love to discuss further if this is something you'd be open to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
