"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  It's something I'm confident you'll find very useful. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a fair price, considering its value to you, and it gives me a bit more than my minimum asking price.  Let me know your thoughts!",9500.0,Alice,1,
