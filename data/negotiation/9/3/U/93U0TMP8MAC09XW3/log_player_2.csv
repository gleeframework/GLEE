# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice's price of $900,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **You can still save money.**  Even though Alice's offer is above her valuation ($800,000), it's still within your budget and allows you to save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
