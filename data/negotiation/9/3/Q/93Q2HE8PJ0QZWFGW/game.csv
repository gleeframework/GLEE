"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the fair market value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
