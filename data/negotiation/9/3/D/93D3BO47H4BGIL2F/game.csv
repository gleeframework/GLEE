"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $175 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still above my budget. How about $140? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $150. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",150.0,Alice,5,
