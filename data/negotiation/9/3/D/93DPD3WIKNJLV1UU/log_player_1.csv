Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is still a great deal for a product worth much more. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price of $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,600 is getting very close to my minimum.  Since this is already round 4, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
