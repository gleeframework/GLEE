Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I can do $9,150, which is a small increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is negotiating in small increments. While you *might* be able to get the price down a tiny bit more, it's risky. She's clearly signaled she's near her bottom line. Accepting at $9,150 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of her backing out or the negotiations stalling."
