Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but I'm only able to go up to $10,500 at this point.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than his initial offer, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value. I have a few rounds left, so I'm going to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work for me. How about $10,800?  It's a fair price that meets us both in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to work within my budget.  How about $10,600?  That's a good compromise and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer to a deal, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, I can get a price closer to my goal. I have several rounds left, so I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,600 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,700?  It's a fair price that's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10700}
