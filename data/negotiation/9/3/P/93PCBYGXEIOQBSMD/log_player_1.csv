I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  I will counteroffer and try to find a more agreeable price."

```

I'm offering $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. Hopefully, this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a significant loss. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway on this one.  It's only slightly below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm hoping he'll finally accept it. If he doesn't, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's clearly not willing to meet me in the middle, and I'm not willing to sell for a price that low. I'm going to go with John's offer, as it's still a profitable deal for me."
