Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  While my absolute minimum price is confidential, to show my sincerity and desire for a swift deal, I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** Mentioning a ""confidential minimum"" creates the impression the price is firm without revealing the absolute bottom line. 
* **Urgency and Sincerity:**  Phrases like ""swift deal"" and ""willing to let it go"" aim to encourage Bob to act quickly and perceive the offer as favorable."
