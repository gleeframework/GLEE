"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll try to find a middle ground in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep some profit while still giving you a great deal on this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $95 is closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $97.50, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $96? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $96 is closer to my minimum, I'm determined to try and get closer to my initial ask.  There are still a couple of rounds left, so I'll try to get a slightly better price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $96, but I'm hoping we can close the deal at $97.  This would be a good middle ground for both of us.  It's a fair price, and we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 97}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $97. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might need to explore other options if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, and we are running out of time. I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might not make another offer and I'll end up with nothing. It's better to guarantee a sale at $100 with John, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product."
