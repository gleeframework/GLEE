"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than $12,000 to me and it's a good price point for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to her value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but $13,250 is still a significant markup from her $12,000 value. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  Would you consider $12,800?  That's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 12800
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably and is now at a price point that's a good deal for me while still giving her a profit.  It's unlikely I can get her much lower, and it's not worth the risk of her walking away or the time to continue negotiating."
