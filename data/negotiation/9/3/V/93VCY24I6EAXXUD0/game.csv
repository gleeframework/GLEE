"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than $12,000 to me and it's a good price point for you.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
