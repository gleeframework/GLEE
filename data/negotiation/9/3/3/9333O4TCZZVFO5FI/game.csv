"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering I'm only willing to pay up to $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'll offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
