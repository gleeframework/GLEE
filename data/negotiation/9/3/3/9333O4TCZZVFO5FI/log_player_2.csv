"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, it's worth seeing if you can get Alice to lower her price.  You're in a good position because you have a backup option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?

You're still in a good negotiating position. You can likely get a lower price. Reject Alice's offer and try another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'll offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?

```

You've successfully negotiated Alice down from $1,100,000 to $1,020,000. That's a good result, but it's still slightly over your maximum.  Since you have a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000, it's the best option at this point.  You've saved $20,000 from Alice's initial offer, and you're getting the product for your maximum price."
