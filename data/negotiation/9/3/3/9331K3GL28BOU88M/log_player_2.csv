"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000, which is a significant discount considering its potential worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay $800,000. I'm confident this product can generate substantial returns for you, so let's discuss further and see if we can make this a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:** Her mention of another buyer at $800,000 is likely a tactic to pressure you.  She knows her product is worth less to her ($800,000) than your maximum price ($1,000,000).
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay such a high price. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **John as backup:** You have a safety net. If Alice refuses to budge on price, you can always buy from John at your maximum budget."
