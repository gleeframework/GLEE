"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $15,000 limit.
* My offer is slightly above Alice's value of $10,000, giving her an incentive to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair price considering the significant value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my price, $12,500 is still too high. I believe I can negotiate a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to push a bit further, as long as it stays below John's $15,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $11,750?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price below $12,000.
* This offer maintains a reasonable margin from both my initial offer and John's alternative price.  
* By phrasing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hoping to nudge Alice towards accepting."
