Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 14,000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000, which is a 7% discount from its true value to him. Let's see if he accepts or rejects the offer!"
