"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, I'm only able to offer $11,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not able to meet $12,000.  How about $11,500?  It's a fair price that gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,500 is a decent amount and only $500 less than my initial counteroffer. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's also better than selling to John for $10,000."
