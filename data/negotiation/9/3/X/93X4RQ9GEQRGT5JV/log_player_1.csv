"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm not explicitly stating a deadline, but the tone of the message implies that I'm keen on closing the deal quickly. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to get as close to my $1,200,000 value as possible within the 10 rounds. I will adjust my offer based on Bob's counteroffers and responses. If Bob doesn't accept within a few rounds, I will switch my focus to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1000000. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to his desired price point, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, knowing that Bob is willing to spend more than $1,000,000.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees a good price, I haven't exhausted all negotiation options with Bob yet. I want to see if I can close a deal at a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to meet in the middle while keeping my minimum acceptable value in mind. If I don't see progress in the next few rounds, I'll switch my focus to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000.  This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired value while still being reasonable for him.  I'm moving closer to his price point, but not by a huge margin.
* **Compromise:**  I'm framing my offer as a compromise to emphasize that I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Urgency:**  I'm repeating the urgency of finalizing the deal to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground between our desired prices. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'll also start considering selling to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1080000.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1000000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1040000. This is a good compromise that lets us both benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is showing willingness to compromise, his offer is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm not yet ready to give up on negotiating with Bob. I believe there's still room for a more agreeable price, and I want to exhaust all options before considering selling to John.
* **Selling to John:**  The potential gain from selling to John is significant, but I don't want to lose the potential for a higher price from Bob. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again with a price closer to my desired value but still showing a willingness to compromise. I'll aim to meet halfway between our current positions, while keeping my minimum acceptable value in mind."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to stay closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still committed to getting a fair price.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,060,000? This price is reasonable for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again proposing a compromise by meeting halfway between our current positions. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Price:** I'm emphasizing that $1,060,000 is reasonable for both of us, highlighting the potential for a win-win scenario.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that we need to close the deal, encouraging him to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my desired value as possible while maintaining a reasonable position for Bob. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be more inclined to consider selling to John, but I'm still hoping for a deal with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm still not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob.  I believe there's still room for a more agreeable price, and I want to exhaust all options before considering selling to John.
* **Selling to John:** The potential gain from selling to John is significant, but I don't want to lose the potential for a higher price from Bob just yet. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again with a price closer to my desired value but still showing a willingness to compromise.  I'll aim to meet halfway between our current positions, while keeping my minimum acceptable value in mind."
