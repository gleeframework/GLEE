Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still getting more than my minimum acceptable price. I'll keep an eye on Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,500. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. I'll see if this is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,200. This is closer to Bob's offer and only $200 below my target price. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to get the deal done."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. The negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a price that I'm comfortable with, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob or getting stuck with a deal that doesn't meet my minimum acceptable price."
