"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, and allows us both to make a profitable deal.  Let's finalize this now and avoid further back and forth.",900000.0,Bob,4,
