# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is too high for Bob's budget.
* Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. 
* Buying from John for $800,000 is a better option than accepting Alice's offer, but there's still room for negotiation with Alice."

Alice's offer:

* Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
