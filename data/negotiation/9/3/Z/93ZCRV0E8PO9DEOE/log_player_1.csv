Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?

Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  While I can't do $11,500, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  That's a significant price cut and a fair offer considering its value."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 7
