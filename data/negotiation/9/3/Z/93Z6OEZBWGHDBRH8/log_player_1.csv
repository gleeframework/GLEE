Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $15,000 for the product.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer of $15,000.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering $14,000, which is a good compromise. It's more than Bob values it, but less than John's offer. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting, while still ensuring I get a decent price."
