"I'm really interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
