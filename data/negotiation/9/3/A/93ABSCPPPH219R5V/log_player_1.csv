{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly opening helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob emphasizes the worth of my offer.

This strategy allows for a back-and-forth negotiation that could potentially lead to a price closer to Bob's value while still ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum, there's still room for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and try to push for a price closer to my desired $12,000. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John guarantees $8,000, I'm willing to risk a bit more negotiation in hopes of securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more than that to you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility by making a counter-proposal.
* **Compromise:**  The new price of $10,000 is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Re-emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $10,000 to him, highlighting the potential benefit of accepting. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation open and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my desired $10,000.
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or make a lower counteroffer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $1,250, which is significant considering my minimum target of $8,000.
* **Time Efficiency:** Continuing to negotiate might take more time and might not lead to a significantly higher price. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, accepting Bob's offer at this point is the most sensible decision to secure a good profit without taking unnecessary risks."
