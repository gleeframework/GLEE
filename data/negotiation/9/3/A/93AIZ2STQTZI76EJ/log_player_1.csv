Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000) aims to set a strong anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it provides room for negotiation. Alice can gradually lower the price, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Backup Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to accept any offer below that price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  The actual selling price will likely depend on Bob's negotiating skills and how much Alice is willing to compromise."
