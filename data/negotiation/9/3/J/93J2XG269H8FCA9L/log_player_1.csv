"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair, while also being closer to what I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still not close to my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher. If he continues to lower his offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm dropping my price to $8,500. This is getting close to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob continues to lower his offers, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $8,000. It's better to sell to John for the guaranteed $8,000 than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
