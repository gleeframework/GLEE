"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""That's a good starting point, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $9,750 is getting closer to his ideal price, he's still within his budget and has more rounds to negotiate. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we go with $9,875? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $9,875 is getting close to his budget, he still has time to negotiate further.  He can try to counter with a lower price, and if Alice rejects, he can consider buying from John as his final option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,875 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750 one last time. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. He's only got one round left with Alice, and while he's getting close to his ideal price, he's unlikely to be able to get her down to his target. It's better to buy from John and get the product rather than risk having the negotiation fall apart and losing the opportunity to buy from him."
