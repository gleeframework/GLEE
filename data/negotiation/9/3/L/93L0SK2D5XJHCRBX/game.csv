"That's a good starting point, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,750?",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",9250.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,875 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,8,
