"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $9,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,000.  I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to the original offer of $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
