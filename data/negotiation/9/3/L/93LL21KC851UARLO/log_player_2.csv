"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob can do better than $9,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While $9,500 is better than $12,000, he can likely still do better than that by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,000.  I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to the original offer of $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer. While he could potentially continue to negotiate, Alice has made it clear that $9,250 is her final offer.  It's likely that continuing the negotiation will just lead to a stalemate, and Bob will end up paying $12,000 to John.  $9,250 is a good price, saving him $2,750 from John's price."
