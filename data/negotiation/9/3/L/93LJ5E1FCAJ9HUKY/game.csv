"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $92, Bob. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $100. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at $100, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,7,
