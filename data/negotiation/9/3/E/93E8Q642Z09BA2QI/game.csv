"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting this opportunity. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $6,000 to start the negotiation.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we settle on $8,500? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
