"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and her own valuation of $1,200,000.  It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the potential of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to counteroffer with $1,150,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and potential benefits, while also being reasonable for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's within my budget and closer to her original valuation. Continuing to negotiate risks going over my budget or losing the deal altogether."
