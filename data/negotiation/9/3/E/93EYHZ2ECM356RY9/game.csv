"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a nice product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $97 is still a little low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $101. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make a deal.",101.0,Alice,5,
