"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's still a great price for such a valuable product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
