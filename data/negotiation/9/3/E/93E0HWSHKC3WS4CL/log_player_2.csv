"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a negotiating point and shows Bob's willingness to make a deal, but within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's still a great price for such a valuable product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob wants to get the best deal possible, so he should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering the maximum he's willing to pay, and he's emphasizing that it's a fair price. This puts pressure on Alice to accept."
