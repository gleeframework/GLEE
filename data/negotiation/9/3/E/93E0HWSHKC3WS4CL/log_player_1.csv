Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.
