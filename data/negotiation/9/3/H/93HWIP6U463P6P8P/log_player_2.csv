"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to John for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
* **John's Price:** $1,500,000 
* **Your Maximum:** $1,500,000

While Alice is bluffing about selling to John for less (she gains more from you), her offer is still below your maximum budget and saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
