Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is a fair price considering I have another seller willing to sell me the product for the same amount.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and would love to find a way to make this work.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price given I have another seller ready to sell me the same product for $1000000.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and counteroffer at $1150000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
