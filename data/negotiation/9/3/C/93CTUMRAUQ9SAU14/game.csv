"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $925000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $997500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll sell the product to you for $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",975000.0,Alice,5,
