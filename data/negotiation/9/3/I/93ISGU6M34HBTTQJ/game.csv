"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1200000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000, but I'm also open to negotiating further. What's your next move?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $900000, and I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $950000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
