"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is based on the assumption that the product is valuable to Bob, but I don't have any information about his potential budget. This allows for room to negotiate down if necessary, but also ensures I'm starting with a price that reflects the minimum value I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product. I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. This is still above my minimum price of $8,000, but shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. It also creates room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I want to close the deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale to John or having to negotiate further."
