**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum price of $1,200,000.  Continuing negotiations is costing me time and potential profit. John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired price.  It's strategically advantageous to cut off negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
