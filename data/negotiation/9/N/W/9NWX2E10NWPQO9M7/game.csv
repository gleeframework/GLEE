"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $11,250 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,375? This would allow me to cover my costs while still offering you a fair deal.",12375.0,Alice,5,
