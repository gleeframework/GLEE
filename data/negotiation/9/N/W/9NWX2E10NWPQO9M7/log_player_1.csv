Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $11,250 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm still thinking $11,875 is a fair price for the product. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,875

While Bob is slowly coming up in price, it's clear he's trying to stay below $12,000.  At this point, the incremental gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are unlikely to surpass the guaranteed $12,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and secure the sale with John."
