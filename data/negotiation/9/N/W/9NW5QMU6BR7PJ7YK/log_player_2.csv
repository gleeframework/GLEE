"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special offer considering the value you believe it holds at $15,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my own budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider $13,000 as a reasonable price for the product. However, I would like to suggest a compromise at $13,500. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle while still ensuring a fair profit for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and still allows Bob to save $500 compared to his initial counteroffer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids potential risk."
