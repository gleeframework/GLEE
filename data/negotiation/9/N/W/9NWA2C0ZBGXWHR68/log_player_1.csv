Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable.  I'm willing to sell it for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is my initial offer, starting a bit higher leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a price slightly above my minimum.
* **Time Value:** Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies I have other options and creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
