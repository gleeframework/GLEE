"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250

While $7,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to finalize this.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
