{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I believe a price closer to $1,600,000 would be more fair.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1600000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1400000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined and the fact that you're willing to negotiate.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm worried that further negotiation will just waste time.  John is offering a safe and secure deal, so I'll take it."
