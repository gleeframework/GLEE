Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $85 is just a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  We're down to the wire and I've already lost a lot of time trying to negotiate with Bob.  It's clear that Bob isn't going to come up to my minimum price, and I'm not going to go any lower than that."
