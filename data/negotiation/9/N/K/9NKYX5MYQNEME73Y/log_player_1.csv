{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. It matches my floor price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or a potential loss by selling to John."
