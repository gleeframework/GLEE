"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $10500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11500. This still gives you a great price, and gets us closer to making this happen. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $11500 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow us to close this transaction.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, and offer the product for $11250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it would be a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",11250.0,Alice,5,
