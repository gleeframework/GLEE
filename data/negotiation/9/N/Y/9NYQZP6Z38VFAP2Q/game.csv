"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $750,000? I feel that's a fair compromise considering it's a significant saving for me while still giving you a substantial return.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
