"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is still too high. He can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and going to the next round allows for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $9,000 is a strong starting point for negotiation. It's still below Alice's minimum, but it shows Bob is serious about buying the product. The next few rounds will be about finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $11,000 is still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much as possible and there are still rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting and counter-offering again keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing his willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best deal. $10,000 is a good middle ground between the last offer and his initial counteroffer.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying and encourages her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's target, he still has room to negotiate.  There are still rounds remaining, and he can likely get a better price.  Rejecting and counter-offering again shows Alice that Bob is determined to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price point but wants to make sure he gets the best deal possible. He is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating his commitment to buying the product while also trying to save as much money as he can. $10,250 is a good compromise, a small step up from his last offer, and leaves room for Alice to accept or negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come down to $10,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, as he's managed to negotiate a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and his own maximum budget.  Accepting this offer is the best option, securing a good deal and saving money without further negotiation."
