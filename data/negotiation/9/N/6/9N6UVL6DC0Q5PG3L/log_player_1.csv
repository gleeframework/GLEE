Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering it at $170 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters your offer. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** The goal is to get the highest price possible. While there's a chance Bob might reject this offer, you always have the safety net of selling to John for $150."
