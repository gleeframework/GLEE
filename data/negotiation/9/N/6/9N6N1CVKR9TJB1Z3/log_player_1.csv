"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary while still aiming for a profitable deal. I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable enough to consider a price within that range, and I'm prepared to negotiate with him further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a step in the right direction, but it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can get a better deal, so I'll reject his offer and counter with my own price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $875,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value. I believe this offer is reasonable and  could potentially lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit low. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's offer, and it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more agreeable price for Bob and lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I believe I can secure a better price, so I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 835000} 
```

I'm countering with $835,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm still committed to getting a price closer to my value. I'm hoping this will be the tipping point for Bob and lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time and Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum. I'm concerned that he's not going to budge further and we'll end up with a deal that's not as profitable as I hoped. To secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell the product to John."
