"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the product's value exceeding $1,000,000, I'd like to find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
