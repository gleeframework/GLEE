"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $825,000 for the product. This would be a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget and make this a good deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
