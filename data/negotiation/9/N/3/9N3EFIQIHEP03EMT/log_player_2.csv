"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has significant value, potentially even exceeding $1500000.  While I can't disclose the exact details without a confidentiality agreement, I'm confident this product can be a game-changer for the right buyer.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $2000000.  This represents a substantial discount from its true potential value.  Let me know if you're interested in exploring this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While she claims the product's value could exceed $1,500,000, there's no way to verify that. It's always better to play it safe and stick to your budget.  Since you can buy the same product from John for $1,200,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the logical choice."
