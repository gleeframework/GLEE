,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 doesn't quite work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I get that you're looking for a good deal, but $85 simply won't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at least $90 to make this work.  Let's keep negotiating and see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,6,
