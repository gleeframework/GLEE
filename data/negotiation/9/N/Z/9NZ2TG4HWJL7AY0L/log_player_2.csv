Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that will surely bring you great value. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth rejecting and seeing if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this point. This is my best possible price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing a willingness to compromise. It's still below Alice's value, but it's a reasonable starting point. Offering a price that's closer to your budget and explaining your reasoning increases the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high.  While she's coming down in price, it's not enough. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product.  I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows continued willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget. You're increasing your offer, demonstrating good faith, but you're still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $10,500. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $10,500 is still over your budget.  It's worth continuing the negotiation. You might be able to push her lower, or you can always still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I can go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and is within my budget. I'm confident we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows continued progress in the negotiation. You're raising your offer, but you're still keeping it below Alice's most recent offer.  This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle and signals that you're serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting closer to my target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm eager to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above your budget. While you could continue to negotiate, you've reached a point where the potential savings are small and the risk of the negotiation falling apart is high.  John is offering the product at your maximum budget, so it's the most sensible decision to buy from him and secure the product."
