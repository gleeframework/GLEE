"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and $11,500 is still above his target of $12,000.  Moving to the next round allows him to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $10,500, which is $500 below Alice's initial offer. This is a significant discount and shows Bob's serious intent to negotiate.  This offer is still within Bob's budget of $12,000 and could be seen as a reasonable starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still above his ideal.  He has several rounds left and can continue to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might lower her price further if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again offering a counteroffer. This time, he is offering $11,000.  This is a compromise from his previous offer of $10,500. Bob is showing flexibility while still trying to get a price lower than Alice's latest offer. It's a reasonable offer that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is now above Bob's budget of $12,000, and it's unlikely she will lower her price further. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at his set price of $12,000,  as it guarantees him the product within his budget."
