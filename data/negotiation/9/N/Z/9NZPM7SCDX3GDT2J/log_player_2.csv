Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I think that's a fair price for this valuable product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $14,000. However, I'm willing to make a compromise at $13,000. I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 

While Alice is coming down in price, it seems unlikely she'll go below $13,000.  At this point, John's offer of $12,000 is the better deal."
