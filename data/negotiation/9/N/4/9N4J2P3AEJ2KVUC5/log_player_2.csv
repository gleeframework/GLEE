"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is selling it at that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the purchase for my maximum price."
