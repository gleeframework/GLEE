"Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's make a deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I am still not able to go above $7,750 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to $8,000.  How about we settle on $7,900? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize the deal.",7900.0,Alice,5,
