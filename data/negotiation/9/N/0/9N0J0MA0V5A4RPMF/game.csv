"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1050000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which reflects a compromise on both our parts.  This price is still well below the value the product holds for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
