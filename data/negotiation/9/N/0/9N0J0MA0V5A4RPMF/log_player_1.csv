Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for a price close to the value Bob places on the product, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $1,150,000, there's a clear incentive for Bob to negotiate. This makes him more likely to counter-offer rather than simply reject.
* **Protecting my minimum:** I'm confident that I can secure at least $1,000,000 from John if the deal with Bob falls through. This gives me a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1050000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly below the value of the product to him. There's room for me to get a better price.
* **Opportunity for a counter-offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired price point. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John now would result in a lower profit compared to potentially getting a better price from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects a compromise on both our parts.  This price is still well below the value the product holds for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob to make him understand why a higher price is justified.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not giving in entirely, but I'm also showing flexibility to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
