"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
