Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your absolute minimum ($1,200,000) might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal and could leave room for him to counter-offer with a higher price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before you go to another buyer might encourage Bob to act quickly."
