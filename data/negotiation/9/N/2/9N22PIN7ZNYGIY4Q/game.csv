"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $100. How about we try $130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $110. I think the product's value is worth more than that.
