"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10200.0,Alice,5,
