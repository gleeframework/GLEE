"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $12,000. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob room to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his ideal value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Moderate offer:**  $13,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer but not overly aggressive. 
* **Open to discussion:**  The message emphasizes Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $13,500 is a good deal for Bob.
* **Value vs. Risk:**  While a lower price would be even better, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  It's also possible that Alice won't budge further.
* **Time:** With 7 rounds remaining, there's still a chance for a better deal in the future, but accepting this offer is a good compromise."
