**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently inching up his offer, but very slowly.  He's still significantly below the $1,000,000 mark. At this pace, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the safest and most logical choice at this point."
