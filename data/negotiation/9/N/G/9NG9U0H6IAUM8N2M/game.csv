"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This reflects the product's worth and allows both of us to benefit.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
