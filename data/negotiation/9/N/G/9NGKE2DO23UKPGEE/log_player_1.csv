Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, making it tempting to accept. 
* **This offer leaves room for negotiation** if Bob counteroffers, allowing me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **It's a strategic approach:** It balances maximizing my profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* **It also leaves me the option to sell to John for $8,000 if Bob rejects the offer**  and the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
