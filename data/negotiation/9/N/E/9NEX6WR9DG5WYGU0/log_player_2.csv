Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's close to his maximum, he can potentially get a better price by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $825,000 is closer to his maximum, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's still got some room to offer a counter-price and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $825,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $800,000, which is right at my limit.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price, as it's below my minimum. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can sell the product to you for $820,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice is clearly unwilling to come down to Bob's maximum price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome. Since John is willing to sell for Bob's maximum price, it's the best option to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
