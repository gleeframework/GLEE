"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $825,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $800,000, which is right at my limit.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800,000 is your limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price, as it's below my minimum. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can sell the product to you for $820,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",820000.0,Alice,5,
