"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both our valuations ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals that we perceive the product's value highly. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer allows us to assess Bob's eagerness and potential for a deal significantly above our minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the safety net of John's offer ($800,000) if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. We know John will buy it at that price, so there's no reason to accept a lower amount from Bob.  We'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to move the negotiation closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value this product brings is substantial.  I could consider letting it go for $900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
 ""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Ground:** We're not accepting an offer below our minimum ($800,000).
* **Strategic Concession:** We've reduced our asking price by $100,000, showing willingness to negotiate but maintaining a strong position. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value, we aim to anchor Bob's perception closer to our desired selling price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We have seven rounds left. Making significant concessions early might leave us with less room to maneuver in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price and provides a $50,000 profit margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a potentially higher price carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling. Accepting now secures a solid profit. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner allows us to allocate our time and resources to other opportunities."
