"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $90.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
