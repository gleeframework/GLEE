"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,800. Can you consider that?",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, but $8,800 just isn't quite there for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,100. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",9100.0,Alice,5,
