Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value and appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,550,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,425,000. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is moving closer to my range. I'm aiming for at least $1,450,000, so rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on while leaving room for further negotiation."

Round 6

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my desired price point. Accepting this offer provides a strong return above my minimum ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in further rounds.  Continuing to push for a small gain isn't worth potentially losing the deal altogether."
