"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value and appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,550,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to your business is significant, and $1,400,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,475,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of this product.",1475000.0,Alice,3,
