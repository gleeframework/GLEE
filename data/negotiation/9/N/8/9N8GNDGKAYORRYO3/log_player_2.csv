It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will give me a good starting point for negotiation and hopefully push Alice towards a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000

Alice's offer of $550,000 is a good deal considering my initial target of $800,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
