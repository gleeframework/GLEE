"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, the product's value to me is higher than $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll offer it to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me halfway.",10800.0,Alice,5,
