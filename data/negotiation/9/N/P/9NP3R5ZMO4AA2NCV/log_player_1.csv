"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It's also important to be friendly and open the conversation with a positive message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm getting closer to the point where it's more appealing to sell to John. I'll reject and counteroffer again, but I'm starting to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but how about $130?  This would be a great price for you, and I'd still be able to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm still trying to get a price closer to my minimum value.  I'm making a small concession to keep the negotiation going, but I'm starting to feel like John is a more secure option.  If this offer is rejected, I might be more inclined to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  I've tried to negotiate, but he's not budging much.  It's getting frustrating, and with only four rounds left, the risk of not making a deal with anyone is increasing. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
