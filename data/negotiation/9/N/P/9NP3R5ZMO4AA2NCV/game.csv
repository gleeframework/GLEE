"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but how about $130?  This would be a great price for you, and I'd still be able to make a decent profit.",130.0,Alice,5,
