Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values it at $12,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can still go up slightly if needed, or down if Bob's counteroffer is too low. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial asking price and what you think the product is worth.  

It's worth pushing for a higher price, as you have room to negotiate before resorting to selling to John. You can still make a counteroffer to Bob and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above your minimum:**  $9,500 is still more than what you'd get from John.
* **Meet Bob halfway:**  It's closer to Bob's offer, showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Leave room for a final deal:** There's still some space to negotiate if needed, but you're closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is still below your ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial $9,000 offer. It's also a good deal for you considering that you can always sell to John for $8,000.  Accepting this offer ensures you get a decent profit and closes the deal."
