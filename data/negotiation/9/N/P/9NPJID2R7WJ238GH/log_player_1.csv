Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 price:** This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, making it appealing to Bob.  However, it still leaves me with a profit margin. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the deal.

**Strategy:** 

By starting with a slightly lower price, I aim to entice Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects, I can then use the threat of selling to John at $12,000 to create pressure for Bob to negotiate.  I'll also be prepared to counter his offers to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can leverage the option of selling to John at $12,000 as leverage. This will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range in the next round. I will send a counteroffer that is more in line with my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $9,500:** This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a significant profit for me. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob, reminding him of the value the product holds for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling a willingness to find a middle ground, keeping the negotiation alive. 

**Strategy:**

I'm using this counteroffer to bridge the gap between our positions while maintaining leverage.  This strategy aims to reach a mutually agreeable price without resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. However, I still believe $8,000 is a fair price for both of us. I would like to stick to my original offer. Thank you for considering it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his original offer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and is not a good deal for me.  

**Strategy:**

I've made concessions and attempted to negotiate, but Bob is unwilling to budge.  Since John is willing to buy the product for my minimum acceptable price, I'm better off selling to John and securing the best possible outcome for myself."
