"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your needs perfectly. Given its high quality and functionality, it's valued at $80. Considering its worth to you, I believe this is a fair price. Would you like to make this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is technically ""fair"" based on her own valuation, there's no room for you to save money. Since you know John will sell the product for $80, there's no harm in rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down in price."
