"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable at an exclusive price. I'm confident it will meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Would you like to purchase it for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. The product looks great, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range of my budget ($100). 
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation and a good buyer-seller relationship."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To better accommodate you, I am willing to offer the product at $95. This is my best offer, and I hope it meets your requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to $95, which is a reasonable compromise. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll refuse, and I'd end up paying $100 to John anyway. Accepting this offer secures the product with a $5 discount."
