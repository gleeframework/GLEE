"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This reflects the product's value while recognizing your interest.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,375,000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I aim for a deal that works for both of us, I have a firm minimum in mind.  Would you consider $1,350,000 for the product?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
