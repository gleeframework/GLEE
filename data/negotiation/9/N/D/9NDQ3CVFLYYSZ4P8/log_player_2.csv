"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $115. I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $115 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to meet in the middle of our ideal price and Alice's initial offer. It shows we're interested but want a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to meet in the middle at $110. This is a reasonable compromise, saving us $10 from our maximum budget and $10 from Alice's initial offer. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially missing out on the deal."
