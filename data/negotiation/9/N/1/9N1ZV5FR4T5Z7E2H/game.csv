"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10750?",10750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11125? Let's find a price that works for both of us.",11125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11125 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $10625?",10625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10625 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle for $10875? I believe that's a fair compromise, and it would ensure that we both walk away happy.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $10875 is the best price for me. How about we try $10500?,10500.0,Bob,6,
