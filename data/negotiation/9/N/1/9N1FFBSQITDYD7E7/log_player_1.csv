Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This keeps the negotiation dynamic. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you can likely do better. There's still room for negotiation, and you want to maximize your profit. Let's see if you can get closer to your initial price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This counteroffer tries to:

* **Maintain your profit:** You're still earning more than your minimum.
* **Compromise:**  You're showing willingness to negotiate but staying firm.
* **Be clear and concise:**  You're laying out your reasoning and offering a specific price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting close to the price John is offering.  While a few dollars more would be ideal, it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
