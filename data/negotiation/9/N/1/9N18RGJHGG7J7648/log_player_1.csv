"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to counteroffer. This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize your potential earnings:** Starting high gives you more bargaining power.
* **Encourage counteroffers:**  A high opening price makes Bob more likely to counter, allowing you to potentially reach a higher final price.
* **Maintain your leverage:** You can always fall back to the $800,000 offer if Bob rejects your offer, or you can even choose to sell to John if the negotiations become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still a good deal for you, but it's important to remember that you're aiming for the highest possible price. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your target of $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000 for the product. I think it's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my preferred range.  I want to continue pushing for a higher price and see if I can get Bob to budge further.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal than $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,000,000.  How about we go with $1,025,000? It's just a small step further, and it shows your commitment to making this deal happen.  Let's bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $1,025,000, which is a smaller increment than the previous rounds. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** The message focuses on the small step needed to reach a deal, emphasizes Bob's commitment to the deal, and highlights the shared goal of reaching an agreement. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiations moving forward. It allows me to potentially secure a better deal while also demonstrating my willingness to compromise."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $975000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob's offer of $975,000 is tempting, it's still below my preferred price range.  I believe I can still push for a higher price.  The key is to keep negotiating and not give up too easily.  Rejecting his offer gives me another opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not comfortable with $975,000.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about we go with $1,000,000? It's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway at $1,000,000. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the compromise and the goal of closing the deal, making it sound appealing and mutually beneficial.
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to close the deal by finding a price that is agreeable to both parties. It demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's important to consider the potential of selling to John for $800,000 if the deal with Bob falls through.  The current offer is $200,000 more than that, making it worthwhile to continue.  Additionally, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, making a deal at $1,000,000 plausible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiations are getting tough, and Bob's offer of $950,000 is becoming less appealing. We've already reached a point where the incremental increase in price is becoming smaller with each round.  

Considering the following:

* **Time Pressure:** Two rounds remain, which doesn't leave much room for significant price increases.
* **John's Offer:**  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $800,000, offering a reliable alternative.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  If the next round ends with a rejected offer, the last round will have a very limited chance of a successful deal. 

Therefore, it's strategically wise to accept John's offer to secure a guaranteed $800,000. While it's not the ideal price, it's a safe and reliable option compared to risking a failed negotiation with Bob."
