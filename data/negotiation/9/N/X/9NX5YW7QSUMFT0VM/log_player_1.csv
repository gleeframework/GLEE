Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high demand by mentioning other potential buyers. This can make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to share his thoughts, suggesting a willingness to negotiate if needed.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This lack of information might work in your favor.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A higher asking price increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. However, it also increases the potential reward if he accepts."
