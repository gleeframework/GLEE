{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a great deal for both of us.  You'll be getting it for well below its value to you, and I'll be making a significant profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **High enough:**  It allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for you to make a profit.
* **Reasonable:**  It's well below Bob's perceived value, making it attractive for him.

I'm choosing to go with a high opening offer because it gives me more room to negotiate downward. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob expressed interest in the product and acknowledged its value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but also consider John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise: 

* It's higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* It's lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* It's still above John's offer, ensuring a better outcome for me.

By framing it as a ""meeting in the middle,"" it adds pressure for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale, especially considering John's offer of $800,000 is readily available."
