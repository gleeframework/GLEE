"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I consider the product's worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this work for both of us. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows you a good margin. Let's find common ground and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to what I want, I'm still not comfortable selling for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum threshold. I want to keep exploring options and see if we can get closer to a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also allowing you to make a profit. I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold with Bob's offer, we're running out of time. It's better to ensure I get the price I need by selling to John, rather than risking further negotiations and potentially ending up with a deal lower than my minimum."
