{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  How about $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how much she's willing to come down."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm trying to meet Alice in the middle while still staying within a price range I'm comfortable with.  This feels like a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I'd like to offer it to you for $102. This allows us both to be satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. While I could try to haggle a couple more dollars off, $102 is a reasonable price, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk the negotiation going south."
