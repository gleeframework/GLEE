"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to be friendly and build rapport with Bob.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I am not thrilled with Bob's offer, I am not going to sell it to him at that price yet.  I am going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I will need to be careful to not push Bob away, but I think there's room for a better deal!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $90?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $90.  I'm hopeful that he will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal of $100, Bob's offer of $85 is a fair compromise, especially considering we are already on round 4. Accepting this offer will secure a sale and ensure I get a price above my minimum."
