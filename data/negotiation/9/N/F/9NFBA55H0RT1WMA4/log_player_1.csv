Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob a reasonable margin to negotiate, while still being a good starting point for me. I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$80 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, so I cannot accept Bob's offer. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference with Bob. $105 is still a fair price for me, but it's also a more reasonable offer for Bob than my initial price. This should hopefully keep the negotiations going and lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although $90 is slightly lower than my desired price, it's still better than selling to John for $100. It's also a good sign that Bob is willing to meet me halfway. I'll accept his offer to close the deal."
