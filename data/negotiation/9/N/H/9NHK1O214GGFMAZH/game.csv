"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've already found a better offer from another seller. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000, but I'm not going any higher. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to walk away.",850000.0,Bob,6,
