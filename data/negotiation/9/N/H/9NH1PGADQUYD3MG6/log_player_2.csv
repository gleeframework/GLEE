"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than you'd pay John. Accepting this offer saves you a considerable amount of money."
