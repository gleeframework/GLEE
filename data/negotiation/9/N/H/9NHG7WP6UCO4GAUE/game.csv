"Alice,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However,  $850,000 is significantly lower than what I  can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
