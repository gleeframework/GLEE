"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, it's significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so you have leverage to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Within Budget:**  $900,000 is well within your budget and leaves space to compromise.
* **Polite and Professional:** The message maintains a positive tone, expressing interest while also making it clear you're seeking a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. A $1,000,000 price tag is still $200,000 above her valuation.  You have the leeway to counteroffer again and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle in the middle at $950,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price directly in the middle of your last offer ($900,000) and Alice's current offer ($1,000,000). It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving.
* **Framing for Agreement:**  By phrasing it as a ""fair deal for both of us,"" you emphasize the mutually beneficial nature of this price point.
* **Leaving Room to Maneuver:** While this is your ideal outcome, there's still a small buffer to potentially negotiate upward slightly if needed, without exceeding your budget."
