Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win situation.
* **Highlighting Bob's value:** I'm mentioning the product's worth to Bob to emphasize the potential benefit for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary.

This approach aims to maximize my profit while maintaining a positive negotiating environment with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to risk losing Bob's interest to see if I can secure a better price. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, emphasizing the potential for both of us to benefit from a deal.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm using language that keeps the negotiation friendly and avoids ultimatums.

By staying firm but showing flexibility, I aim to find a price that's both profitable for me and acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle in the middle at $950,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much:**  There's a good chance that further negotiation will only result in a few thousand dollars more, which is not worth the risk of losing the deal.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that he'll lose interest entirely. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the sale."
