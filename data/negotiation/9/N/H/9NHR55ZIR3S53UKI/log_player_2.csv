"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price by making a counteroffer. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to explore potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $550,000 for the product. This price still leaves you with a good profit and allows me to achieve my budget goal."", ""product_price"": 550000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product at $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $575,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer saves me $225,000 compared to buying from John.  While I might be able to negotiate a bit lower, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer (or Alice changing her mind) outweighs the potential for a slightly better price."
