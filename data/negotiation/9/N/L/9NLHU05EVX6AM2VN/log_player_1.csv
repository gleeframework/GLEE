Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $105.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
