"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you and my initial offer. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good deal, considering I'm willing to pay up to $800,000. Accepting this offer saves me $75,000 compared to buying from John."
