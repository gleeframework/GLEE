"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $700,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desire to sell it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
