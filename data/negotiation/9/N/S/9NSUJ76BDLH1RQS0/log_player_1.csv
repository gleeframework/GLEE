{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value ($80) but still potentially attractive to Bob. 
* **""open to negotiation""**: This signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in further discussions.
* **""I think you'd really love it""**: This adds a bit of positive persuasion, highlighting potential value for Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit**: Starting high allows for more room to negotiate down.
* **Gauge Bob's interest**: His response will give insight into how much he values the product.
* **Maintain control**: I'm ready to counter-offer or sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:** This might make Bob more willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:** It allows me to set a counteroffer and potentially earn a higher price.
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  If he's truly interested, he might be willing to increase his offer. 

Selling to John right now would be a missed opportunity to potentially get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is my minimum, I'm confident this product is worth more. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $90. This allows for some profit for me, while still being a great deal for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  $90 is a compromise,  showing flexibility while still being above my minimum.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Positive framing:**  ""Great deal"" reinforces the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  ""What do you think?"" encourages further discussion.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  $90 is a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** It shows commitment to finding a deal.
* **Gauge Bob's willingness to compromise:**  His response will reveal his level of interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm now faced with a choice between:

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  This secures a sale at $85, which is above my minimum and represents a decent profit.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering:**  This risks further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether, as Bob might become frustrated or decide to walk away.
* **Selling to John:**  This would yield a lower profit ($80) compared to accepting Bob's offer.

Given the risk of losing the deal and the fact that Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $85. This is a good outcome for me, and it avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
