"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less.  It's in his best interest to negotiate with Alice or simply buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is beyond my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget and John is offering the same product for $8,000.  Bob has more leverage by making a counteroffer or going with John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can find a similar product elsewhere for less.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $9,000. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, $9,200 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. John is offering the same product for a price that's within Bob's budget, making John the better option at this point."
