"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it would be of great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is better than $150, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  You know the product is worth $100 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $115 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $125. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're still aiming for the lowest price possible. While $125 is better than $150, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering again. There's still some wiggle room to negotiate as Alice is willing to go lower than her initial $130 offer."
