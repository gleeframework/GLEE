"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone by acknowledging the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I believe this product is truly worth more.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. I can either accept this offer or sell to John for the same amount. However, by accepting Bob's offer, I avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or even a rejection of my counteroffer. This also saves me the effort and time of further negotiations."
