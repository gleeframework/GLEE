"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this price is fair, considering both our interests. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come down in price. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to a mutually agreeable compromise. ",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $885,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",885000.0,Alice,5,
