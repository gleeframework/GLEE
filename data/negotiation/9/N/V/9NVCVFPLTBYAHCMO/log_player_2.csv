Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $750,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value while also being more affordable for you. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $680,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being more affordable for you. What do you think?

At this point, Alice has come down considerably in price, and $700,000 is a reasonable price point. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome, and risks pushing Alice away from the deal."
