"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable.

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $2200000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial asking price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1900000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $2000000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone above my initial budget, and I need to be more aggressive with my counteroffer. I'm willing to offer $1950000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1950000.0,Bob,6,
