Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a strategic starting point. By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, I increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer. However, I'm still leaving myself room to negotiate if he rejects the offer.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his responses and my willingness to accept a lower price.  If the negotiation drags on, I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to use the next round to try to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. I'll need to be careful not to push too hard and risk losing him completely, but I also don't want to settle for a price that is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly but firm, acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the product's value. I'm highlighting the potential for a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and a genuine desire to reach an agreement.  I'm hoping to strike a balance between securing a decent price and not pushing Bob away entirely. This approach allows me to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $1,050,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still below my minimum, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing Bob entirely is too high. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a significant profit. 

**Strategy:**

This decision highlights the trade-off between maximizing profit and securing a deal.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's important to consider the potential loss of a buyer if I push too hard.  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale."
