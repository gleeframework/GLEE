"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate the offer, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my budget. How about $900,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price that's closer to the value I know you place on the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This would allow both of us to make a decent profit. ",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to pay $975,000, but I'm not ready to accept yet. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000 was a bit too high, but $975,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a good deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to seriously consider buying from John.",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"I can see you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a high price for the product. However, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $1,050,000. If you're not willing to pay that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling to John.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
