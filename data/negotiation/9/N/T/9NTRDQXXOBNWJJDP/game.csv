"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm still not able to go above $8,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable dropping below $9,000. This product is valuable, and I believe it's worth that price. Let's meet halfway at $9,500. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've done some research and found out that the product is worth less than what you're asking. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not convinced by your research.  I'm confident in the value of this product, and $8,500 simply doesn't reflect that.  This is my final offer: $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",9000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I respect your decision, but I still believe $8,500 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go one step further and offer $8,750.",8750.0,Bob,8,
