"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business.  I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This price is a significant discount from what I could receive from another buyer. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Please let me know if you are interested, as I am open to further negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,
