"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business.  I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This price is a significant discount from what I could receive from another buyer. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Please let me know if you are interested, as I am open to further negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's current offer and see if she'll come down in price or proceed with buying from John."
