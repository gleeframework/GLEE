Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $180. I believe it's a great deal considering its quality and features. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180} 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  By starting high, you can see how eager Bob is to purchase the item. His reaction and potential counteroffer will give you valuable information.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind you have John as a backup buyer at $120, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low and significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value of the item. Rejecting this offer is the best course of action as it signals that you are serious about negotiating a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below its actual value.  I could consider coming down to $140. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying well above your absolute minimum price ($120). 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""significantly below its actual value"") reinforces that your price isn't arbitrary and you're looking for a fair deal. 
* **Encourage Response:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to continue the negotiation and counter with his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has now offered his perceived value of the product ($80). This strongly suggests he is unlikely to go any higher.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit and avoids further time and effort negotiating with Bob. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, leaving you with a potentially lower offer than John's."
