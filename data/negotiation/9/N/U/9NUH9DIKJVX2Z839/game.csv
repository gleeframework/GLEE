"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but that price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price, considering my valuation and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering our valuations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell it to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,5,
