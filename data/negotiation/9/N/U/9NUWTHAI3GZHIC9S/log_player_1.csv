Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to counteroffer at $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  $8,500 is still below my minimum, and I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a slightly higher price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,875 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay above my minimum while still giving you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
