Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $300,000 difference ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) where both you and Bob can benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $300,000 as possible, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if needed while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Value-Focused:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price. 
* **Professional Tone:**  Maintain a professional and respectful tone throughout the negotiation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), you might adjust your offer and message accordingly.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John offers a safety net, are there other potential buyers who might offer more than John's $1,200,000?  

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy in place for how you'll respond."
