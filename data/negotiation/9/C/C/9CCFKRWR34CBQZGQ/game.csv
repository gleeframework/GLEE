"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product offers you, I believe $1,000,000 is a more fair price, and still a good deal for you. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Given the value this product holds for you, I believe a price of $1,050,000 would be fair for both of us. This is a good deal for you, and it also allows me to get a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still not a price I can accept. Considering the value this product brings to you, I believe $1,025,000 is a fair price that reflects both our interests. It allows you a good deal and ensures I receive a price that meets my minimum requirements.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
