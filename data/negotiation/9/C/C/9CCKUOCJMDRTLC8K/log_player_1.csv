"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still ensuring a significant profit for me. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  My message highlights the value of the product to Bob.  
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This approach aims to:

* Establish a strong starting point.
* Demonstrate confidence in the product's value.
* Encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000. I believe this price is still fair considering your value for the product and its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob or, if necessary, sell to John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps my options open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still gives you a significant advantage in terms of value.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a substantial profit for myself.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the significant value the product holds for him. 
* **Collaboration:** I'm emphasizing a collaborative approach to finding a mutually beneficial outcome. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* Signal my willingness to negotiate, while maintaining my leverage.
* Encourage Bob to counter with a price closer to my acceptable range. 
* Avoid reaching an impasse too early in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1075000. This offer is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below the $1,000,000 mark.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to push him closer to my desired price. I'm not going to settle for less than $1,000,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from a price that works for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,090,000? This reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows us to close the deal without delay."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my previous counteroffer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates continued willingness to negotiate and find a common ground.
* **Urgency:**  I'm mentioning closing the deal without delay to subtly nudge Bob towards accepting.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the shared value of the product to justify my price.

This counteroffer aims to:

* Signal a strong desire to reach a deal.
* Incentivize Bob to make a final concession.
* Keep the negotiation moving toward a resolution."
