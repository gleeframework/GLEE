"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that could be extremely valuable to you, and I'm confident you'd find it a great asset. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, which is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $13,000, while John is selling it for $15,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though you are paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($10,000), you are still saving $2,000 compared to buying it from John."
