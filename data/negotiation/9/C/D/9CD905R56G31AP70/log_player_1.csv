Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. After reviewing the product's features and potential, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This price reflects the value I believe the product has, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,275,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product has, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**  Bob has returned to his original offer of $1,250,000 and signaled it's his final offer.  It's unlikely he'll go higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, it's more beneficial to sell to John at this point.  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, leaving you with a less favorable outcome."
