{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $9,500, Bob is still getting a good deal, but it's not so low that he'll immediately accept. This gives room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still above your minimum price of $10,000, but this opens the door for potential counteroffers that might get you closer.
* **It's a reasonable opening offer:**  It's not too aggressive, but it shows you're serious about selling and aren't willing to give it away for a song. 

Let's see how Bob responds and continue negotiating from there!"

# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I want for the product.  While I'm not thrilled with his counteroffer, I'm not ready to settle for that low price yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating a bit more, but if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
