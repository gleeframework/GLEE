Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. My initial offer for the product is $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
