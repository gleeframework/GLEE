"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
