"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to get a strong starting point for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,350,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Bob to consider.  It's a compromise, but I want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's always a risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer, or even walking away from the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids further uncertainty."
