"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
