"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 is below its worth.  I could consider parting with it for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. It's a fair price that recognizes the product's value, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,300,000 is a strong deal. It provides a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
