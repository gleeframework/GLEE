"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers you substantial value, and I'm confident it will more than pay for itself.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'd like to make a deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
