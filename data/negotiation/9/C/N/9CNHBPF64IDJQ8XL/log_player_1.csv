Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'd like to make a deal at this price.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $850,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
