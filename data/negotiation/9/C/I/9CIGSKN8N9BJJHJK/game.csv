"Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a fair price for this product, but I believe $1,600,000 is a more reasonable starting point.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your proposed figure, the value of this product is firmly above that mark. I'm willing to move down to $2,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're passionate about this product, but $2,100,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, while also allowing for a profitable transaction for you.",1850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I'm willing to make one final adjustment to bridge the gap.  My final offer is $1,975,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for a product of this caliber.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,975,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000 for this product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll have to explore other options.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
