"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to see if Bob is serious about buying.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate for this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it above my minimum value.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though we're already in round 4. While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still staying above my minimum value.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation and Bob's offers are still too low. I'm not willing to risk further rounds and potentially end up selling for less than my minimum value.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price and secures the deal quickly."
