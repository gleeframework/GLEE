Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm open to negotiation and I know I can always sell to John for $120 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on a value that's above Bob's initial counteroffer. I believe this price is fair and likely to be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering $102, which is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still below my desired profit margin.  Since I can sell to John for $120, it's time to cut my losses and move on."
