"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price, as I still have 8 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell at that price.  I have several rounds left and believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll continue negotiating with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. I know it's not your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I have several rounds left and am confident I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of patience. $9,500 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $9,800 as a final compromise. This is my best offer, and I'm not sure if I can go lower. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're running out of patience, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I only have two rounds left. It's clear that I won't be able to get a price closer to my desired value.  To avoid losing out on a guaranteed profit, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $15,000."
