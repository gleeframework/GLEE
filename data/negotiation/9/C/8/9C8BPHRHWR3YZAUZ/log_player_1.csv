Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, hinting at its overall value and your desire for a quick sale might make the price more palatable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational and invites Bob to share his thoughts, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject a higher offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to aim higher with Bob."
