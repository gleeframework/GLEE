Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $10,000 is a $2,000 profit margin, which is significant. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away or you having to concede further.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While John offers a guaranteed $8,000, accepting Bob's offer secures an extra $2,000."
