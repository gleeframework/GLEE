This reflects the significant value this product offers and would still allow for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let me know if this is closer to what you had in mind.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. While $900000 is still below my desired price point, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1050000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
