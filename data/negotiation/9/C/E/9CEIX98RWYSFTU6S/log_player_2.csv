"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the conversation with an initial offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal started.
