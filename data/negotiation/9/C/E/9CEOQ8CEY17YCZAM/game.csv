"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your price. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. It's a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable with the price. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
