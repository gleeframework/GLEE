Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob doesn't accept my initial offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I'm always keeping John's offer of $15,000 in mind. If Bob's counteroffers become too low, I'll be ready to stop negotiating and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?  I'm eager to make a deal, and I believe this would be fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and it's also much lower than the initial offer I made. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to make an offer. I can counter with a price closer to my target.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is the best possible outcome, I want to exhaust my options with Bob first. There's a chance I can get closer to my target price through negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll try to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us. 
* **Monitoring John:**  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind, as it's a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with $12,500, which is halfway between my last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $12,500, he's still getting a good deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if necessary, but I'm not going to drop below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer, but I want to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000 unless there's no other option.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my goal. I'll use a persuasive argument to explain why my price is fair and emphasize the value of the product. 
* **Monitoring John:** I'll continue to be aware of John's offer, but I'm focused on negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. It's a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable with the price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is a small compromise from my last offer ($12,500) but still above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while staying firm on my price.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing that it's a ""significant investment"". 
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, fantastic! If he rejects, I'll need to consider whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer and will consider it if negotiations with Bob stall."
