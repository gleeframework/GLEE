Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a high chance of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:**  $950,000 is well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, meaning I still make a substantial profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so a price of $950,000 is a good deal for him and likely within his budget, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, we have some room to negotiate without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price."
