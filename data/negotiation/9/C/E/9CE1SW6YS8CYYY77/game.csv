"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.  How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. Let me know if this works for you!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than where I want to be. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at $11,250, I'm willing to make the deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
