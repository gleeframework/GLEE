Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a significant profit. It also demonstrates that I'm confident in the product's value.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still allows me to make a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the full amount I initially hoped for, $960,000 is still a very good price for me and it's clear Bob isn't budging much further. I'd rather secure the deal and avoid risking a further negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
