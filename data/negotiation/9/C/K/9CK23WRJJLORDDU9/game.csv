"Bob, it's great to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this investment will yield significant returns for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. Would you be open to considering a price of $1,900,000? I believe this is a fair offer, taking into account the long-term value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but my budget is firm.  I can go up to $900,000.  That's a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move. I've been analyzing the numbers, and to make this work, I need to be realistic about my minimum. Let's settle this right now. I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to make one final concession. If you agree to $1,300,000, we have a deal. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your decision.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
