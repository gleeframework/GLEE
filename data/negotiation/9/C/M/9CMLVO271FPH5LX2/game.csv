"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,025,000. This is already a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
