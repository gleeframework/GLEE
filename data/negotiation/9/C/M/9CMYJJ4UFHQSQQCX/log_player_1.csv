Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding the power of your backup offer from John. Since John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), you can use that as leverage with Bob. You should aim for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but potentially lower than your guaranteed price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than what John offers.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it brings."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Price:** The offered price of $1,400,000 is:
    * Higher than Bob's valuation, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.
    * Lower than your guaranteed price from John, making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or try to negotiate the price down. Having a clear understanding of your bottom line ($1,500,000 from John) will help you negotiate effectively.
* **Relationship:**  While maximizing profit is important, consider the potential long-term relationship with Bob. If he's a valuable contact, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price to secure the deal and build goodwill."
