"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $2000000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $2000000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. This price is fair and allows us to potentially reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay. Let's split the difference and settle on $1650000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us to conclude this negotiation quickly.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1650000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1750000. This is still a fair price, and I believe it's worth considering. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1750000 is still above my limit.  Let's meet in the middle at $1700000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1700000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a 5% discount on the price. So, the new price would be $1610000. What do you think?",1610000.0,Alice,7,
