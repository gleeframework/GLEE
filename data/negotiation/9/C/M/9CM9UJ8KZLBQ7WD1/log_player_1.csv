"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident I can negotiate further and get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can improve the price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but still a good price for me. I believe this is a good offer that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit low. I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I believe I can negotiate further and get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and continue the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum and believe this is a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations are getting tough, and I'm starting to feel like I might not be able to get a price that's closer to my desired value.  I've already made significant concessions, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum.  It's getting risky to continue with these negotiations. To avoid further losses and ensure I get at least my minimum value, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
