Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $1,000,000 is too far below the product's true value. To move things forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000.  This reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

$1,900,000 is still too high. I'll counter with a lower offer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  To demonstrate my seriousness, I'm willing to pay $1,500,000.  This is a substantial offer that reflects the value I place on the product. Let's continue working towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
