Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway *between our last two offers*  at $1,150,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is moving in the right direction, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant increase in his offer. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
