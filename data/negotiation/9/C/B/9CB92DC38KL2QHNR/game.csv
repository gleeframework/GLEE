"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the potential of this product, $800,000 is a bit high for my current budget.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's potential benefits. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable going up to $700,000, which is a big jump from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I can offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can close the gap.",900000.0,Bob,6,
