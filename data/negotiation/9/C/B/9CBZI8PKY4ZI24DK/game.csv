"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
