{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. My asking price is $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, giving me room to negotiate if needed. It also includes a friendly message to establish a positive tone. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to find a price we can both agree on before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Is there any way we could come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures I get the value I need and avoids further negotiation."
