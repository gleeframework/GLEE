Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Gain:**  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as valuable. Starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Backup Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  This approach leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $10,000 but lower than $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiation style beyond his valuation of the product."
