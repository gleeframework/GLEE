"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, knowing I have a fallback option with John at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price from Bob in the next round. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still maintaining a margin that's more comfortable for me. I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this counteroffer, as it's closer to his initial offer and still gives him a good deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I can still sell to John for $1,500,000 if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below it.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get a better price from Bob.  With John offering $1,500,000, it makes more sense to sell to him now and guarantee a profitable outcome.  I'm not willing to risk further rounds with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
