"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000.** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn closer to my minimum of $15,000.
* **The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

I'm starting with a high offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. If the negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $9000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further, especially since I have 8 more rounds to go. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:**  I've lowered my price from $12,000 to $11,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:** I've emphasized the value of the product to reiterate why my offer is still fair.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message ends with a question, inviting Bob to continue the discussion. 

I'm aiming for a compromise that is more profitable for me while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum of $15,000, I'm still not happy with that price. I've already made a significant concession, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I have 6 more rounds to reach a more favorable price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to push for a higher price without risking losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500 for the product, but that's my final offer.  This is a very unique product with a lot of value, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  Again, I'm highlighting the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Compromise:** I've reduced my price from $11,000 to $10,500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but staying within my acceptable range. 

I'm hoping this final offer will be enough to entice Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the product's value, I am willing to pay $10200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,200 is a very close to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. With only 4 rounds left, I'm willing to take a small risk and try to push for a higher price.  I believe there's still a chance that Bob might be willing to go up a little, considering he just increased his offer.

By rejecting this offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price. However, if the negotiations don't improve in the next few rounds, I'll switch to selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,200.  While it's closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,350. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10350} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's right in the middle between my last offer ($10,500) and Bob's latest offer ($10,200). 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that my offer is a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially encouraging him to accept.
* **Urgency:**  With only 3 rounds left, I'm aiming to reach a deal quickly. 

This is a risky move, as Bob might reject my offer and potentially lead to a sale to John. However, I believe that a small increase from Bob's last offer is still within his budget and worth the risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we could find common ground. I agree that $10350 is a reasonable compromise. I'll pay $10300 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,300 is very close to my minimum of $15,000 and the last offer I made of $10,350. Given that we only have two rounds left, and the risk of selling to John for $15,000, I'm choosing to accept this offer. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice in this situation. It guarantees a sale and gets me closer to my goal."
