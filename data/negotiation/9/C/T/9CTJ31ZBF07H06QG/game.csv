"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already considered buying from John for $80, and I think that's a better deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go up to $102.50. That's the highest I can go. Would you be willing to accept that?",102.5,Bob,6,
