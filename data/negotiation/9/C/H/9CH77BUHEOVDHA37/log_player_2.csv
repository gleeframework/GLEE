"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to profit. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and if Alice rejects it, Bob can adjust his counteroffer in the next round based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price range.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob losing the product to another buyer is present. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price below what he'd pay John, and minimizes the risk of further negotiations."
