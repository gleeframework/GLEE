Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a price that's  fairly high, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's potential for a win-win situation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a good price. It's also a good buffer from John's offer, giving me more room for negotiation."
