"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing terms."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high to establish a strong initial position.  There's room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:**  While the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, Bob valuing it at the same price suggests there's potential for him to perceive even greater value. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  By stating I'm ""open to discussing terms,"" I signal a willingness to negotiate without appearing desperate.
* **Alternative Option (John):**  The offer from John acts as a strong fallback position, ensuring I won't settle for anything significantly less than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I started high, and he countered reasonably. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle during the next round. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for that just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer of $1,200,000, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its potential for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling flexibility by coming down from my initial asking price, but not drastically.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's high value to keep the perceived worth high in Bob's mind.
* **Middle Ground:**  $1,350,000 represents a midpoint between my initial offer and his counter-offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still significantly above my safety net of $1,000,000 from John, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is meeting me almost exactly in the middle of our previous positions. While I could potentially push for a bit more, there's a risk of jeopardizing the deal. Accepting $1,250,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
