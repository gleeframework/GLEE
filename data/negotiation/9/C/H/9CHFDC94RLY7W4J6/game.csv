"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $90? It's a fair price that we can both agree on.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you at $95. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
