Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I can do $110, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point, and it's a reasonable deal at $108. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to buy from John for $150."
