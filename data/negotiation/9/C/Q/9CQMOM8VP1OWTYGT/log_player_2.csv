"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I know you'll find valuable.  Given its exceptional nature, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,250,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, however,  the value this product represents is significantly higher than your current offer.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its true worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

``` 

While $2,000,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget. You're willing to pay $1,500,000, so rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate is the best choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for the product.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part and would allow us to close the deal.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While $1,750,000 is closer to the mark, I'm confident this product's inherent value warrants a higher price.  I'd be willing to accept $1,900,000. This allows me to recognize your investment while still reflecting the product's worth. Does this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,800,000,  which I believe is a fair price considering the value you've outlined and my own financial limitations.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
