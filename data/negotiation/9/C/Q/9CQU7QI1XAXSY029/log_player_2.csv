Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. By offering $1,100,000, he's making a bold move, but it's still within the realm of possibility considering Alice values the product at $1,500,000. This counteroffer sets a strong starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her previous offer, which is a negative sign. It suggests she might not be willing to budge much.  However, Bob still has room to negotiate a better deal.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of pushing for a significant discount. By increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, he shows that he's willing to negotiate but remains firm in his desire to get the best possible price. This counteroffer is a strategic move, aiming to find a middle ground that both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is increasing, indicating that she's not budging much from her initial asking price.  The deal is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, and it seems like further negotiations might not yield a significantly better price.  It's time to cut losses and buy the product from John for $1,200,000, securing a deal within his budget."
