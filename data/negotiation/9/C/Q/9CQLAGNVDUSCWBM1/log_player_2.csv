"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely counter-offer and see if you can negotiate a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, $15,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay.  I think a price closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counter-offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a deal below your maximum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A counter-offer of $6,000 leaves a large gap for negotiation, signaling to Alice that you're serious but also expecting her to move significantly on price. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and suggests a collaborative approach, but firmly states that the initial price is unrealistic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $10,500 is still significantly above your $8,000 maximum. While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, you have room to negotiate further. 
* **John is an Option:**  Remember, you can always buy from John for $8,000. This gives you leverage to walk away if Alice doesn't come down enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not moving too close to our $8,000 limit just yet.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will give us a better idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. If she rejects this outright, it might be time to consider John's offer more seriously. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** We want to keep the negotiation friendly and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $7,500.  This product is worth a considerable investment. How about $9,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.
* **Too High:**  While $9,000 is closer to your limit, it's still above your $8,000 maximum and wouldn't be the best use of your budget. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000.  

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will come down further, and you're better off taking the sure thing with John's offer."
