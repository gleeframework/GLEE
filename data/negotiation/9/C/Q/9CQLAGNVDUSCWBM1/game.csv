,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $15,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay.  I think a price closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $7,500.  This product is worth a considerable investment. How about $9,000? That's my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
