"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the market value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm prepared to pay $10,250. This is a fair price that's within my budget, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,500, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
