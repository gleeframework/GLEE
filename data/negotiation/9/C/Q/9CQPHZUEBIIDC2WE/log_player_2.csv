# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down to $10,500, Bob has only two rounds left. If he rejects this offer, Alice might not budge further, and he risks being stuck with a higher price. John offers the product for his desired $10,000, which is a guaranteed deal that saves him money and time."
