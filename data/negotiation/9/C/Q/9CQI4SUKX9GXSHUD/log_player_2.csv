"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by counter-offering.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price of $90 than her initial offer of $100.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer, and I'll end up with a worse deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
