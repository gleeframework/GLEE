"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. This gives Bob a chance to accept a good deal while still leaving me room to potentially get closer to his value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $90? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to Bob's perceived value of $120. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
