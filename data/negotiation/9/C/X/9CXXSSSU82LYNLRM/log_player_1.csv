{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $125.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $80 but below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very useful. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already gone through two rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
