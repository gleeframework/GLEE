Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,500 if Bob accepts my offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product for $9,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he pushes back.  
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I'm not relying solely on Bob.  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John gives me leverage in the negotiation."
