"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 represents the high end of its value, I recognize you're a serious buyer. How about we settle at $1,425,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1425000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,425,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000. How about we try $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be a bit firmer on the price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as I already have John offering me $1,200,000 and going lower would not be worth it for me.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
