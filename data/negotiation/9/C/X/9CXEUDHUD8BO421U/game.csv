"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a $100 limit. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $120 is still a bit out of my preferred budget range, I would like to make a counteroffer at $110. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $115. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",115.0,Alice,5,
