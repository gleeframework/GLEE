"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,800,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
