"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's still above his desired price point of $12,000. There are still 9 rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $11,000? That's still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his $12,000 limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since there are still 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize it."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his initial goal, it's below his $12,000 limit from John.  He's also made good progress in the negotiation and it's likely Alice won't go lower.  It's a good time to secure the deal."
