"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand the product's value, but I'm only comfortable paying $850,000 at this time. It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a price that I believe is fair, considering the value you've stated. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it reflects my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's close this deal, but we need to find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still working within my budget.  I can offer $925,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in your product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
