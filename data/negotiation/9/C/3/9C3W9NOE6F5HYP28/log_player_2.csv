"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth to you, I am offering it to you for $10,000. This price reflects its high quality, functionality, and the unique value it brings to someone like yourself. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, you know your maximum value for the product is $12,000 and Alice is likely willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a better price, potentially closer to Alice's $8,000 valuation."
