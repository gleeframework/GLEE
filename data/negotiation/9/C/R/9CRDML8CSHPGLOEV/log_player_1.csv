Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable, but that price is a bit high for my budget.  Could we work something out closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be frank, I have another offer for $800,000. If you can come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider the other offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly signaling this is his ceiling. Accepting his offer gives me $800,000, which is a significant amount and better than risking him walking away completely."
