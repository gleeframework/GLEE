The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $13,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate further. You're still saving money by buying from Alice compared to John, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
