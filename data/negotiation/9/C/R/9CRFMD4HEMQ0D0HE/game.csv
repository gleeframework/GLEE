"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle!",12500.0,Alice,3,
