I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $980,000 is a good deal, especially considering I've already rejected several offers and I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  The risk of losing the deal altogether is too high, and selling to John for $800,000 is not ideal."
