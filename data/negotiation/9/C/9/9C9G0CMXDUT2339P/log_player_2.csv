Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable going below $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $72 and $78, so how about we settle at $75?

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $75.  While you could continue negotiating, you risk her settling at $78 or even walking away.  Accepting $75 secures a reasonable discount."
