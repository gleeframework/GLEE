"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a great price, considering it's worth at least $10000 to me and significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($12,500 < $15,000).**
* **You save $2,500 compared to buying from John.** 

While the product might be worth more to you than $12,500, it's still a good deal considering your alternative is paying $15,000."
