{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage.

By offering the product at $120, you're:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but you have some wiggle room.
* **Capturing a significant portion of the value:** You're aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation than your minimum. 
* **Still above your minimum:**  Even if Bob negotiates a bit, you're likely to make more than selling to John."
