"I understand you're interested in the product, but I have to make a living. I can do $11000, which is the lowest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9500. How about we compromise at $10500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10200. Can you meet me at that price?",10200.0,Bob,6,
