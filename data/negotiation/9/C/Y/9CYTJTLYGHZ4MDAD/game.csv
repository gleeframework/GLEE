"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1300000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This still allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
