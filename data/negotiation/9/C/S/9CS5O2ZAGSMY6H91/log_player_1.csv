"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This allows for a negotiation process where we can both find a price that works. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any time, so I won't be too aggressive in lowering my price if Bob doesn't accept my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low offer right away.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of a higher price and demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell. 

**Next Steps:** I'll prepare a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming to find a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still considering Bob's limitations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $10,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly suggesting that $10,000 is a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation flowing. 

**Important Note:** I'm still keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $15,000, which gives me confidence in holding out for a higher price. I will adjust my counteroffers in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $9,000 is still below my ideal profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe there's still room for compromise. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between Bob's offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $10,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and creating a win-win scenario.
* **Closing the Deal:** I use language suggesting a desire to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and prompting Bob to consider accepting.

**Important Note:** I'm mindful of the fact that I can still sell to John for $15,000, but I'm also aware that the more rounds we go through, the higher the risk of Bob walking away or of me losing valuable negotiation time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I can go up to $9,250, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $9,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $9,000. While it's still below my ideal profit, it's a decent deal considering the potential risks.
* **Risk of Losing Bob:**  There's a chance Bob won't go higher, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely by rejecting his offer.
* **Limited Time:** We're already in round 6, and I want to avoid further delays.

**Next Steps:** If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to re-evaluate my options in the next round, potentially considering selling to John for $15,000 to avoid losing out entirely."
