"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He is willing to pay up to $8,000 and Alice is asking for $12,000, leaving significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet halfway! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still higher than his maximum willingness to pay. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal, he's still above his maximum budget. He has several rounds left, and there's potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I can go up to $9,250, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
