"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Alice is offering the product for $13,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject the offer and buy from John for $8,000."
