"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,750 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm genuinely trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $9,750 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like.  How about we settle at an even $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
