Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a price that is higher than his perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers, but also ensures I'm getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,500.  This is still a bit lower than what I'd ideally like, but it's a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's counteroffer.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm not confident I can get a better deal from him, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
