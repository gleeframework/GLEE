Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation, but it also reflects the value I place on the product. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
$1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum threshold, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up with a higher price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum threshold.  John is offering a price that is much closer to what I want, so I'm going to sell the product to John."
