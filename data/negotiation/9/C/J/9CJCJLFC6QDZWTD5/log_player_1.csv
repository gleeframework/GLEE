Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it. I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a figure that's closer to my desired value. This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still holding some room for further negotiation."

Bob is unwilling to negotiate further, and I've already reached my minimum. Selling to John is the best option to secure my desired value."
