"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $1500000. I believe it's a fair price given its unique value, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob.  Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer. If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to go with John's offer and pay $1,000,000, ensuring a purchase within the acceptable range."
