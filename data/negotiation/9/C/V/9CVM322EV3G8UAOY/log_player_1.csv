"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $120 is lower than what Bob is willing to pay ($150). 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price in later rounds based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was wondering if there's any room for negotiation. I'm looking to spend no more than $100 on this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  While it's closer to your minimum than your initial offer, it's still below the $80 you're willing to accept. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:** You have 8 rounds left, and you can counteroffer with a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Selling to John is not optimal yet:** While selling to John guarantees you $80, you can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I'll accept $110 for the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within a reasonable range:** $110 is closer to Bob's offer, but still above your minimum.
* **Shows flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates you're willing to compromise and find a solution.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob still rejects, you can adjust your offer again in the next round."
