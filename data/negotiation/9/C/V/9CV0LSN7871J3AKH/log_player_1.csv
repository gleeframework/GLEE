{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also uses a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my value.  I'm also confident that I can secure a higher price with John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $97.50?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
