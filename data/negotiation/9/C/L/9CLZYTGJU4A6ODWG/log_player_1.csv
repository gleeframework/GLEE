This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

$100 is still too low for me. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately below what I'm able to accept at this time.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll still find this to be a great value."", ""product_price"": 110}
