"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $120 is still too high for you, and you can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately below what I'm able to accept at this time.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll still find this to be a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The price is still a bit higher than what you'd like, but $110 is within your budget, and it's likely you won't get a better deal from Alice.  It's also cheaper than buying from John."
