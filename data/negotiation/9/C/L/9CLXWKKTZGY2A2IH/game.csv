"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I think the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below my value for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle, and see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're coming up in price, but $975,000 is still too low. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise that takes both of our positions into account. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer.  To show you I'm serious, I can go up to $1,000,000.  That's a big jump for me, and it's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
