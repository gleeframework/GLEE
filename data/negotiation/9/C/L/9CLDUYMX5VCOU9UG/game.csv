"Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $90?  That still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $90 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers - how about $82.50?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",82.5,Alice,5,
