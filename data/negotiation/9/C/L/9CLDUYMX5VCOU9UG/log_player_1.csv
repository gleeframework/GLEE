Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** You're still earning a profit, and if Bob rejects, you can always sell to John.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This avoids confusion and sets the tone for a respectful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value, and selling to John for $150 would be much more profitable. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, as you may be able to reach a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $90?  That still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $90 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than Bob's initial offer of $60, it's still significantly lower than your minimum value of $150 and also below the $90 counteroffer you just made.  It's worth trying to push for a higher price, as John is waiting to buy for $150, giving you a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers - how about $82.50?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
