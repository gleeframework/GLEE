Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."

I'm reducing my price slightly to show flexibility while still ensuring a profitable deal. This counteroffer is a middle ground between our previous offers, hopefully encouraging Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to close the gap while staying within my acceptable range."

I'm reducing my price again to 1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's close enough to Bob's offer to encourage a deal.  I'm hoping to reach a final agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's more beneficial to reach an agreement than to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price."
