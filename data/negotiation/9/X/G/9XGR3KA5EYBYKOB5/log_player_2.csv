(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  You might be able to get a better deal with Alice, or at least get a feel for her negotiating style."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a bold move, but it signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for further negotiation.  Hopefully, Alice will counter with a price closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get a better price.  I'm hoping to get Alice to come down to around $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, while still being significantly below her offer. I'm hoping this will be close enough for her to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to pay more than $1,000,000. I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if I can get her to accept my price.  At this point, I'm only willing to go up a little bit, but I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum price of $1,000,000. This is the price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it.  If she doesn't, I'm going to buy the product from John at the same price."
