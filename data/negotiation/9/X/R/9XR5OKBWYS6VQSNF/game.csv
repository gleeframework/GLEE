"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If we can agree on this price, I'll buy the product immediately. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
