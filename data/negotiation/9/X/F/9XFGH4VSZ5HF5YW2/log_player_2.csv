"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get an even lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows that he's serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a reasonable price, especially considering that Bob's maximum budget is $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject further offers or Bob might run out of time before reaching a mutually agreeable price. Accepting the offer at $850,000 secures the product at a significant saving and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
