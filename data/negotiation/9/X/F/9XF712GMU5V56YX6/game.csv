"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe it's a bit steep at $900000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the product is a bit pricey, but I believe it's worth more than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $950000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $920000?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $920000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $860000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced we're at the optimal price. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're not willing to budge at all from $900000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll meet you at $880000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",880000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $880000. However, I'm still not convinced this is the best price for me. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum of $900000. How about we meet at $885000?",885000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement at a lower price. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll meet you at $882500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",882500.0,Bob,10,
