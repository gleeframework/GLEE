,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $9500? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
