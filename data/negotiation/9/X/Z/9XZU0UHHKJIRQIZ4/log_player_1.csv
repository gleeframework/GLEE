Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I understand you have a budget in mind. Could you consider $17,000? This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for working with me.  While I appreciate the adjusted price, I still think it's a bit high. Could you do $11,000? I think that's a fair price and would allow me to close the deal today.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me as well. I'm motivated to sell this product, but I need a price that makes sense for me too.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would be my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming back to me. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $11,500, and I think that's more than fair. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Bob is not budging much on his offer, and we're already past the halfway point in the negotiation.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk a lower offer or a stalemate with Bob."
