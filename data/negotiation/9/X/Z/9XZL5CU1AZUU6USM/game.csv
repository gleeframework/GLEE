"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 represents the high end of my expectations, I'm certainly open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal.  What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,4,
