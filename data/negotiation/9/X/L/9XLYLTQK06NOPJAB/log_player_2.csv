"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($12,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($12,000) while still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is a compromise, and it's closer to Bob's desired price than his own counteroffer.
* **Saving money:**  While not the absolute lowest price, accepting this offer still saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John. 
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation is already in round 3, indicating time is ticking. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, especially if Alice becomes less willing to compromise."
