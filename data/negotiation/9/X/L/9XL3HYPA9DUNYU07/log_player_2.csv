"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $13,000 is a decent price and lower than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down closer to her value of $12,000."
