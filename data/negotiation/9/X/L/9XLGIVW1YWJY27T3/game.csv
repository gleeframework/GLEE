"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for me. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. While I appreciate the offer, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really hoping to make this deal work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $11,000, which is $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
