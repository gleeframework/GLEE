"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $13,000? That's a fair price that would let us both walk away happy.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I can offer it to you for $13,200. It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
