Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will want to buy the product, as it's worth more to him than the asking price.  I'm also prepared to negotiate further, as I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum. I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I will counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $1,000,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
