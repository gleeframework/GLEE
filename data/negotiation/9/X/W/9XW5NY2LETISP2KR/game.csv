"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. Can you consider it?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I value your business, $950000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1050000. This reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $990000. Can you consider it?",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're still aiming for a lower price. While $990000 is closer to my ideal, I'm still at a loss at that point. How about we compromise at $1020000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to move forward with the sale.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1010000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider it?",1010000.0,Bob,6,
