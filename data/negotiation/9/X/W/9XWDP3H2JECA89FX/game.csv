"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $11,750. Can we meet in the middle at that price?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,800 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",11800.0,Bob,6,
