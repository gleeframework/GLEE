"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob is interested but not willing to pay that much. I'm also leaving a decent margin of profit for myself, as I know the product is worth at least $100 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$60 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $100. While I'd rather have something than nothing, it's not worth losing that much money. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $120. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$75 is still below my minimum price of $100. I'm going to reject the offer and counteroffer again.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, though, and I'm keeping that as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $105. This is my final compromise, as it's just above my minimum price and allows me to keep some profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I would have preferred to get more, we're running out of time and I'm not sure if we will be able to reach an agreement with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and it's better than continuing to negotiate and possibly ending up with nothing."
