"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
