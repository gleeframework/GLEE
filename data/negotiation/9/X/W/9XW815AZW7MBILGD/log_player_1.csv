This offer starts high but still leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob the feeling of getting a good deal while ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $8,200 is above my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,850?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8850}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer.  How about $8,500? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise and is close to my minimum acceptable price. It's better than selling to John for $8,000, so I'll accept this offer."
