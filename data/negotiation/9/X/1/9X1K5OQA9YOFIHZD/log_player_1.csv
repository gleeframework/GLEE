Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While we'd ideally like to get more, Bob has steadily increased his offer and it's now above our guaranteed sale price with John.  It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and we risk losing him entirely if we push further. Taking the $1,050,000 ensures a profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations with an uncertain outcome."
