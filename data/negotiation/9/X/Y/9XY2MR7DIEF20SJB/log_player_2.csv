{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation. We can likely get a better price, especially with 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a good deal early on.  This price is still above Alice's value for the product, leaving room for negotiation. If she rejects this offer, I can adjust further in subsequent rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, there's still room for improvement. I'm going to try and get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates I'm serious about negotiating but still leaves some room for Alice to come down a bit more if she wants to reach a deal. It's also a good strategy to avoid getting stuck in a pattern of constant back-and-forth with the same counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'd like, and with several rounds left, it's worth trying to negotiate further.  I'm confident that I can secure a better price, especially since we're already at the halfway point of the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still staying below Alice's most recent offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. With only 4 rounds left, I'm hoping that Alice will accept this counteroffer and we can finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'd like to pay. While we're running out of rounds, I'm going to make one last attempt to get a better price. It's possible that she might be willing to come down further to close the deal. If not, I'm still prepared to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $975,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still hoping to close the deal with Alice. With only two rounds left, I need to be realistic about what I can achieve.  However, this offer remains below Alice's most recent one, and I'm hoping she'll accept it to avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,006,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,006,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now above my maximum acceptable price. With only one round left, it's unlikely I can negotiate her down further.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John to ensure I get the product.  While John's price is higher, it's still within my budget, and I'm not willing to risk another failed negotiation."
