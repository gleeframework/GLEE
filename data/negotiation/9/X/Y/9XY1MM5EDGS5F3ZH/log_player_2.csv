"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to get a reasonable return on my product. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price and within Bob's budget.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high at this point. Accepting the offer secures a good price without risking a higher cost from John."
