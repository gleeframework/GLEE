"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $650000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $725000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $725000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to go with another seller if we can't reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to walk away, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $715000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",715000.0,Alice,5,
