"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects the product's true value to you.

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering it to you for $13000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
