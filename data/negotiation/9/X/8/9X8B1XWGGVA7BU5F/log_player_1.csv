"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to get a price significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $135.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum and leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $130.  This is a final compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal, but if Bob still refuses, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offers have been steadily decreasing, and while $120 is still more than selling to John, I'm worried that Bob will continue to lower his offer, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to secure a guaranteed profit, even if it's not the ideal price."
