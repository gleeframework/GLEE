"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,000,000 is my lowest acceptable offer. Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $1,000,000 is your lowest acceptable offer, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need.  How about we compromise at $975,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. ",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's my final offer. Please consider it.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $965,000 is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",965000.0,Alice,7,
