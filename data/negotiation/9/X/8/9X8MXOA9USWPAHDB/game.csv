"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $9,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately $7,500 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $8,500?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum price point.",8500.0,Alice,3,
