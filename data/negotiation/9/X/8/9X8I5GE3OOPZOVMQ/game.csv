"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100 for this product.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $130. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $125. That way we both get a fair deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer the product for $128. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",128.0,Alice,5,
