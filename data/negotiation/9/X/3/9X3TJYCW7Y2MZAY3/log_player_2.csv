"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value while still being beneficial to both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $950,000. This gives you a substantial advantage while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let's talk. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your max price:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it."
