{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, the risk of him continuing to refuse my offers is too high.  At this point, I've already been in negotiations for several rounds and have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum asking price. It's better to secure the sale and ensure I get the minimum amount I want for the product."
