"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $175 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a bold move, but it establishes your firm upper limit. It also sets the tone for a more aggressive negotiation, forcing Alice to either come down significantly or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $140 is still above your budget.  You're getting closer to a deal, but you have 7 rounds left. There's still time to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still a bit high at $140.  How about $120? It's a good compromise, and it's the most I can afford."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've shown you're serious about buying the product by moving closer to Alice's price. Offering $120 is a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a deal.  It keeps the negotiation moving forward without completely jeopardizing your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $120 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $140. How about $135? It's a good middle ground, and I think it's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your price, $135 is still above your limit. You're already in a strong position, having negotiated down from $175.  There's still time to try and secure a better price, and with a potential ""safety net"" of buying from John for $100, you can afford to be a little more cautious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit high for me. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal. Let me know if you're open to it."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a small compromise by increasing your offer to $125. It demonstrates that you're still actively negotiating while staying within your budget. This tactic keeps the negotiation moving forward while also putting pressure on Alice to make a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up a little on your offer. However, $125 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $130.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and would allow us to close this transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $130 is still above your budget.  You're within 3 rounds of your safety net with John, so there's still time to see if you can squeeze out a better deal. You've shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice may be willing to go even lower to avoid losing the sale.  There's no need to rush a decision at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit high at $130.  I'm willing to go to $127, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 127}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while staying within your budget.  You're only $3 away from your desired price, and with only 2 rounds remaining before you can buy from John, there's not much room for further negotiation. This move puts the pressure on Alice to decide whether to accept your offer or risk losing the sale entirely."
