"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This still leaves you a significant profit margin given the value of the product for your business. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",800000.0,Bob,4,
