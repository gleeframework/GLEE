"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. We believe it's a game-changer and would love to hear your thoughts on it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. We think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less for the product.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still a bit apart on the price. Considering the product's value and potential returns, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a competitive price, and we believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your willingness to negotiate. $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably land.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000?  This would be a win-win, allowing me to stay within budget and you to secure a good sale.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, we're not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. We're willing to make one more concession, but we need to get closer to our target price. We're willing to offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is our final concession, and we believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
