Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its value and quality.,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is my maximum budget for this. Let me know if you're open to that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I pay $11500? This would allow us to both reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
