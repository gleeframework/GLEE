Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're motivated to sell, but I'm not willing to go above $975,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While holding out for $1,000,000 is tempting, Bob seems firm at $975,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
