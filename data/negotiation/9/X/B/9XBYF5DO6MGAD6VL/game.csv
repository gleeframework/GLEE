"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me considering the value this product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,025,000. How about we try $975,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  While I'm motivated to sell, I'm also confident in this product's value.  To be fair to both of us, I could go as low as $1,000,000.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're motivated to sell, but I'm not willing to go above $975,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
