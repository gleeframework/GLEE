"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $11,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,250.  This offer represents a significant discount on its true worth to you.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",11500.0,Bob,4,
