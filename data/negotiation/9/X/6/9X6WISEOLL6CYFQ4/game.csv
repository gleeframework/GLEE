"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $675,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. I'm willing to accept $875,000. This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $875,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll go as low as $700,000, and that's my final offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,6,
