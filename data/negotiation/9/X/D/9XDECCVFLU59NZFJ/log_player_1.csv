Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my own valuation of the product, I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only offer $950,000 at this time. This is a strong price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a successful transaction. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. At this point, the incremental gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are unlikely to outweigh the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing."
