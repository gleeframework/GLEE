"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it,  Would you be open to discussing that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer.  Let's try $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
