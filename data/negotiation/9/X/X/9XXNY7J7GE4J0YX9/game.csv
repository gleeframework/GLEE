"I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price",9000.0,Bob,4,
