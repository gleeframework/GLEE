"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  Let's discuss a price that benefits us both.  What do you think about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **It's a better deal than John's:**  While you could buy from John, Alice's offer saves you $100,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Alice's initial offer is high, her message suggests she's open to negotiation, potentially allowing you to save even more."
