"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit much for my budget. Could you meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $105? This is a good compromise, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is closer to your value, but it's still a bit above my budget.  I could do $95 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
