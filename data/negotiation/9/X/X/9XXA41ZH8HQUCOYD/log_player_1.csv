"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is still a good price for me, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, but I have a guaranteed offer from John at the same price. To avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential rejection, I'm choosing to sell to John."
