{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (even though he is unlikely to), while still ensuring I get at least $120 if he declines.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball Bob."
