"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation. I believe that Bob will likely counter-offer, giving me the chance to see how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is more reasonable and still ensures I earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I will reject his offer and keep negotiating. I still believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a little low, but we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm offering $8,000. This is my minimum acceptable price.  I think Bob will realize we are nearing the end of the negotiation and might accept this offer.  If he rejects, I'll have to decide if selling to John is the best option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds and Bob seems unwilling to budge on his price.  While $7,500 is close,  I'm going to sell to John for $8,000. It's the most secure option at this point, ensuring I meet my minimum profit."
