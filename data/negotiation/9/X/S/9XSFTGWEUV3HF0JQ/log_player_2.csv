"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth considering at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to make a deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You have a lot of room to negotiate and can likely get a much better price.  There's no reason to accept the offer in round 1."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your estimated value."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a reasonable price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still a bit high. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's too early to accept, and buying from John would be significantly more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're in the middle of the negotiation.  There's no need to accept yet, as we can likely get a better price.  Buying from John would be much more expensive than continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target price. However, I'm willing to make one final concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but only if you're willing to throw in some additional value, such as a warranty or maintenance package. This would make the deal more attractive to me, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price slightly, she's now adding a condition that's not ideal - a warranty or maintenance package. This could potentially add cost in the future, and it's a complication we don't need at this point. It's better to try to negotiate a cleaner deal without added conditions, and we still have some room to bargain.  Buying from John is still a much more expensive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a warranty or maintenance package, but I'm not comfortable adding that to the deal right now.  However, I am willing to meet you at $1,025,000, without the additional conditions. This is a fair compromise, and a great deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I need to think about the opportunity cost of not selling to John for $800,000. I'm willing to make a final offer, and I'll throw in a 5% discount on the price. This will bring the price down to $971,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $971,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $971,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Alice's final offer, and it's a good deal for you.  You're getting the product for significantly less than John's price, and it's only $23,750 more than your initial counteroffer in round 2.  There's a good chance that if you reject this offer, Alice will walk away and sell to John, leaving you without the product.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
