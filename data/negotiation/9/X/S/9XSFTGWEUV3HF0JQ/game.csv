"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth considering at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to make a deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your estimated value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a reasonable price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target price. However, I'm willing to make one final concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but only if you're willing to throw in some additional value, such as a warranty or maintenance package. This would make the deal more attractive to me, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a warranty or maintenance package, but I'm not comfortable adding that to the deal right now.  However, I am willing to meet you at $1,025,000, without the additional conditions. This is a fair compromise, and a great deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I need to think about the opportunity cost of not selling to John for $800,000. I'm willing to make a final offer, and I'll throw in a 5% discount on the price. This will bring the price down to $971,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal.",971250.0,Alice,9,
