,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Given my budget, I'd be happy to offer $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
