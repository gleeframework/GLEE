"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly less than my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I want to see if I can get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit low for me. Given its value, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a significant amount, but I still believe the product is worth more to me. Considering your willingness to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** While $1,100,000 is still above my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer. This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm not yet ready to commit to $1,100,000.  I believe I can still push for a lower price, especially since I have multiple rounds remaining. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John is still my last resort, as it's significantly more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,000,000.  To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise and a price that I believe is reasonable for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to reach a price closer to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll counter with an offer of $1,025,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $1,025,000 is very close to my ideal price of $1,000,000. I've managed to significantly reduce the price from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiations. If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, I risk Alice rejecting it and potentially losing the deal altogether.
* **Better than John:**  While $1,025,000 is slightly higher than my ideal, it's significantly less than what John is offering.  

By accepting Alice's offer, I secure a good deal and avoid the risk of having to buy from John."
