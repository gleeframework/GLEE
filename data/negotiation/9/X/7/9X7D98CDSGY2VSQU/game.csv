"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit low for me. Given its value, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a significant amount, but I still believe the product is worth more to me. Considering your willingness to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,000,000.  To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise and a price that I believe is reasonable for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach a price closer to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll counter with an offer of $1,025,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
