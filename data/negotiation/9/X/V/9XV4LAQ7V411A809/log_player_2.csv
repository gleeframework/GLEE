Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you've got a standing offer for $800,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $725,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice seems firm at $725,000 and unlikely to budge further. It's not worth risking a better deal by continuing the negotiation. Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees the purchase and prevents potential further haggling with Alice."
