"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $725,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  To be completely transparent, I've got a standing offer for $800,000 from another seller.  To make it worth my while, I'd need you to come down to $700,000. Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you've got a standing offer for $800,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $725,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,5,
