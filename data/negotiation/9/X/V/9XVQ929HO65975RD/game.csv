"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. To start our negotiation, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This leaves room for some negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a fair price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your confidence in its worth. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below my expectations. I understand your budget constraints, but this product is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've reviewed your proposal and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that the product's price should be more aligned with my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to my expectation, I'm still not quite there.  Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
