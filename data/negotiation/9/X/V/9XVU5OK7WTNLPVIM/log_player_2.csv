"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  He's going for a 16.6% discount, which is a substantial starting point for the negotiation. This initial move sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Even though it's closer, it's still not ideal. It makes sense for Bob to continue negotiating to try to get a better price. There's still room for Alice to lower her price, and Bob can use his counteroffers to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final counteroffer, offering Alice's minimum acceptable price. He's hoping that Alice will be willing to accept this offer, as it's her floor price and avoids the need to go through another round of negotiation. If Alice rejects, Bob can always buy from John for the same price, so there's no further downside to this counteroffer."
