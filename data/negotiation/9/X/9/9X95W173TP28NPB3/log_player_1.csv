It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  $880,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Trend:**  Bob is consistently increasing his offer price, but in smaller increments. This suggests he's nearing his maximum.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a slightly higher offer, but the potential gain is shrinking and the risk of Bob walking away increases. 

Accepting the $880,000 secures a great deal now."
