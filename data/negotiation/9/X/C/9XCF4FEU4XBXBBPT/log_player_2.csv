"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget of $8,000. It's too risky to accept her offer. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming for the lowest possible price. Since you're willing to pay $8,000 to John, you should start with that price as your counteroffer to Alice. This sets a clear boundary and shows your seriousness in getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $18,000 is closer to your budget, it's still significantly higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate.  By offering $10,000, you're still below her price but showing a willingness to move closer.  This keeps the negotiation moving and potentially gets you a better price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,500 is getting closer to your budget, it's still a significant amount over what you're willing to pay.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not going to budge significantly lower.  Buying from John for $8,000 is the safest and most cost-effective option."
