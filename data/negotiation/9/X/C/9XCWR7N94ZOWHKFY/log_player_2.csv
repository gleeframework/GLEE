"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  While Alice's offer is higher than her perceived value of the product ($800,000), it's still $100,000 less than buying from John. 
* **Saving money is the goal:** As Bob, the goal is to save money. Accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
