"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that $120 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $160? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  This would allow me to buy the product without going over my budget, and I'm confident you'd still be getting a good price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good price for it. How about we go with $155? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
