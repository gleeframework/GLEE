"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal value. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his ideal value of $10,000.  A counteroffer of $12,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. This strategy balances the need to save money with the potential for a successful deal within the limited rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's still below Bob's maximum price of $15,000 and is closer to his ideal price of $10,000.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee of a better price in future rounds, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
