"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price."
