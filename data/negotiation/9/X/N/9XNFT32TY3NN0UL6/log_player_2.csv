"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to her own valuation than mine. I should counter with a much lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counteroffer is a starting point to see Alice's flexibility.  It's important to be firm but polite, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going that low. How about we meet in the middle at $80? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met my price! This is the best possible outcome as it's the lowest I'm willing to pay. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John."
