Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and a good price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob, creating a more positive atmosphere.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of the $1,000,000 offer from John, so I'm not pressured to accept anything below that. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation up to my desired price.
* **Encourage a quick deal:**  A positive, clear offer might lead to a faster acceptance.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the item at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can potentially increase the offer closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, continuing negotiations has the potential for a higher profit.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired value but still within a range that might be acceptable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Adjustment:** I'm only reducing my offer by $25,000, showing flexibility without significantly sacrificing my profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits of acquiring the product.
* **Openness to Compromise:** The message implies I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:**  A smaller price reduction might make my offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Preserve the potential for a higher profit:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am unable to meet the price of $875,000. I am proposing an offer of $860,000 for the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is only $15,000 away from my previous counteroffer. This suggests we're very close to an agreement.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process.
* **Profit Margin:** While $860,000 isn't ideal, it's still a significant profit and a decent outcome given Bob's initial offer.

**Considerations:**

* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John for a lower profit.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Delaying the sale could cost me potential earnings from other opportunities.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale. The potential gains from further negotiations are outweighed by the risks involved."
