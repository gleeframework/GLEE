"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to negotiate further if that's not acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1200000 is a bit too low for me considering its unique value.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1275000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position.  While $1275000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal quickly.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
