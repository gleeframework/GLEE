"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000. That's a good price for both of us, as it's still well above your value and a significant discount from my maximum.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This would be a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
