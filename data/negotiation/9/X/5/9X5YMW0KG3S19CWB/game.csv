"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. My initial offer is $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the exclusivity you mentioned, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $22000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and exclusivity. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see your point about the value and exclusivity of the product, $22000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15000, but I'm not comfortable going any higher. Let me know if that's something we can work with.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a better offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $19000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable going above $15000. This is my final offer. I'm confident that a good deal can be reached at this price, as it's fair to both of us. Let me know if you're open to it.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept $15000. I've already compromised with my previous offer of $19000, and I'm not comfortable going any lower than that. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm thinking of meeting you at $18000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",18000.0,Alice,7,
