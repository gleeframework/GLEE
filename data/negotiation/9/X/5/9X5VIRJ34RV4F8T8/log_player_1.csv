Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him a small incentive to buy. At the same time, it's lower than my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I still make a profit.  This strategy maximizes my chances of selling to Bob while also guaranteeing a sale to John if Bob rejects the offer."
