"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $6,800? I think that would be a fair compromise.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $6,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $7,200.  This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.  Let's make a deal.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I feel like we're getting closer.  How about $7,000?  That's a solid offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",7000.0,Bob,6,
