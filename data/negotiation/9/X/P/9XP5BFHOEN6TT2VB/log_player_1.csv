Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a fair starting point, as it's above Bob's value for the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $120, but I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's tempting to take that money, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $120, and I can still sell to John for $120. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, hoping to find a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $110, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $85. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my target. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident I can push for a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. This is a compromise again, but I'm getting closer to my desired price. I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'm still open to continuing negotiations, but I'm getting closer to the point where I might be willing to accept John's offer of $120."
