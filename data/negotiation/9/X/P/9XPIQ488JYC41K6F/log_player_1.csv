Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
This is a starting point. Here's why I chose this:

* **$10,000 is a good starting point:**  It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly:**  It creates a positive tone and emphasizes the value of the product. 

**Remember:** The goal is to maximize your earnings while leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.  The negotiation process will depend on Bob's responses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, there's still a chance to get a higher price.  By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Show you're not desperate:** This can make Bob more willing to negotiate further.
* **Explore a middle ground:** A counteroffer might allow you to secure a price closer to your initial asking price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meet him halfway:**  $9000 is the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows you're willing to be flexible.
* **Emphasize value:**  ""I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable"" reinforces the worth of the product, subtly pushing Bob towards a higher price.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** This helps keep the negotiation positive and prevents it from turning adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $8,500 is only $500 less than your minimum of $8,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and if you reject, you might end up selling to John for the same price. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation takes time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a decent price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
