"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to go as low as $120. I'll meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go.",135.0,Alice,5,
