"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your high standards. This product is truly exceptional, offering unparalleled value and benefits that align perfectly with your needs. Given its unique features and the quality it embodies, we believe it's worth more than $10,000 to you. However, to facilitate a transaction, I propose a special introductory offer for you. For a limited time, you can acquire this product for $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity to own something that is not only valuable but also holds significant personal importance to you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and her perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, which might encourage her to lower the price closer to her own valuation.  You can then decide if her lower offer is acceptable or if you are better off with John's offer."
