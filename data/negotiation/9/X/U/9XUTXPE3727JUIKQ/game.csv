,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $8,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still well above your offer.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I believe I'm offering that. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with your offer.  $8,000 is my absolute bottom line, given the value of the product.  I'm willing to give you one last chance to come up to that price.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
