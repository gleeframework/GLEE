"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still above your limit.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is closer to your goal, it's still not ideal.  You're close to your limit and can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still a bit too high.  Would you be willing to do $87? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $87 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $89. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you would prefer to pay $80, Alice's offer of $89 is very close to your limit, and you're getting a good deal. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a lower price in the remaining rounds.  It's better to accept and close the deal with Alice rather than risk losing the opportunity and having to buy from John at a higher price."
