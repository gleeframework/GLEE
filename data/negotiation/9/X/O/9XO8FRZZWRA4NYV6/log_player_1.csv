"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling, but I'm currently working with a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target value by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm confident this product will provide you significant value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would still allow me to gain a reasonable profit while providing you a great deal.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my current financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,500 is still below my minimum desired price, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress!  While I value our negotiation, I'm still a bit above your offer.  To bridge the gap, how about $10,500?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued effort in finding a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the value of the product and my budgetary constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  Bob's offer of $10,000 is reasonable and gets me closer to my target, so I'll accept it to avoid risking a further decrease in price or a possible loss of the sale."
