Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but it still leaves room for potential counteroffers from Bob. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but not so high as to immediately deter Bob from negotiating.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $800,000, so I have a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure the sale, I believe I can do better.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Additionally, John is still an option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still above his initial counter.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. I believe this price is still fair, considering the product's value to Bob and my own minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $825,000 and avoid further negotiation, I think I can still get a slightly better price.  Since John is willing to pay $800,000, I have a safety net if I don't get a better offer from Bob. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get a price closer to my minimum goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I'm lowering my price slightly to $875,000, which is closer to his offer but still above what John is willing to pay. This shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's fair to me.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. Bob's offer is my minimum, but continuing the negotiation seems futile at this point.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid risking further rounds.  John provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, which is a good outcome."
