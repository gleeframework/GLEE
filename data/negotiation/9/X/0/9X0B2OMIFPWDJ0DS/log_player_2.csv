Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial price, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, and he should try to counteroffer again to see if he can get a better price."

Bob should buy from John. At this point, Alice's lowest offer is still $12,000, which is above Bob's budget. John is offering the product for $10,000, which is within Bob's budget and saves him $2,000 compared to buying from Alice."
