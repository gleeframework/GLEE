Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to see it as a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1100000. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I'm not willing to settle for such a low price right away, but I'm open to negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price from Bob. 
* **John is a strong backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price. 

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired price but still lower than my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:** $1,050,000 is still above Bob's offer but is much closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **I'm still willing to negotiate:** I'm not yet ready to accept Bob's offer, but I'm signaling my willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and highlighting the fact that my counteroffer is still a good deal for him. 
* **John is still a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1050000 is getting closer, I'm still only able to offer $1000000. This is my final offer, as I have another option available at that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still below the $1,200,000 that I can get from John. 
* **Bob's ""final offer"" is a bluff:** His mention of another option available at that price is likely a tactic to pressure me.
* **John is a better option:**  Given the potential for further negotiation with Bob and the risk of losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.

**Conclusion:**  I'm choosing to sell the product to John because it is a better and more secure deal."
