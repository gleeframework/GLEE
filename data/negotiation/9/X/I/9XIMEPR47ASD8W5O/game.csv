"I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",82.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $78 is getting a bit too low for me. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $81. It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,
