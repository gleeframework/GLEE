# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
