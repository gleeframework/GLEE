"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  Considering its value to me is $8,000, I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $9,250, which represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,250. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering its value to me is $10,000.",9750.0,Alice,5,
