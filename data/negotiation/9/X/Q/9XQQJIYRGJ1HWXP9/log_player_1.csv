Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm hoping for $8,800. It's still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,400. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, $8,400 is closer to my minimum and it's likely that further negotiations will only result in a lower price. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of losing out entirely."
