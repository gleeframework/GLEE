{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this presents a fair deal considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Offering it at $1,350,000  leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you don't want to go below that.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer makes Bob feel like he's getting a slight discount while maximizing your potential earnings."
