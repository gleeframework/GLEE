"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll get from the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. I'm proposing $1,600,000. This reflects the product's quality and potential benefits to you, while still allowing for a reasonable profit for me.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it will bring to me.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,550,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product for you while allowing me to achieve my financial goals. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial solution.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,550,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,475,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to me.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
