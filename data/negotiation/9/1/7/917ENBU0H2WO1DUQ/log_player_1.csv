Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $150 represents a 25% markup from your minimum acceptable price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **First Offer Psychology:** Offering a slightly higher price initially gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It also establishes the perceived value of the product. 

**Important Note:** If you had more information about Bob (e.g., how much he values similar products, how eager he seems to buy), you could tailor your offer more precisely."
