"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
