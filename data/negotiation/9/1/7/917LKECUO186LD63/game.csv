"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850000. I'd like to propose a compromise at $775000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go up to $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $825000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
