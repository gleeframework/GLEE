Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
