"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This offers you a significant profit while still allowing me to stay within my financial limits.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price reflects a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,150,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,125,000 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,087,500. This price is a fair compromise, giving you a solid profit while allowing me to acquire the product within my budget.  I believe this is our final opportunity to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1087500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,087,500. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1120000.0,Alice,9,
