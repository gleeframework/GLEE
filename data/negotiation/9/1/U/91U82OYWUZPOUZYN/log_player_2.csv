Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $120?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $100 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $125. Can you meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $120. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra money."
