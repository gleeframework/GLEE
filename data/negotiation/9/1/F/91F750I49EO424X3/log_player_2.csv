"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget, he should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but Bob should try to get a better deal from Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  He should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for improvement, and buying from John is always an option if the negotiation stalls."
