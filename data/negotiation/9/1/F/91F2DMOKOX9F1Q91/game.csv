"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value and the current market.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify the $10,500 price point.  Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I feel that's a strong offer, and it would allow us to close the deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
