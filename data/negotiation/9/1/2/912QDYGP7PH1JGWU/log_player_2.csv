"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to get it a bit closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $135. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $120 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $135. This is a good deal for Bob.
* **Budget:**  $135 is within Bob's budget of $150.
* **Risk:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge more. Additionally,  John offers the product for $150, making Alice's offer the better option.

By accepting, Bob secures a good deal within his budget without risking losing the opportunity to a higher price."
