"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still allows for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I also want to see how interested Bob is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a better price. While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my initial asking price.  I'm going to see if I can push for something closer to $15,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating. I'm still holding out for a higher price, but this counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer, and we're getting closer to my desired price.  At this point, it's a reasonable price, and I'm happy to accept and finalize the deal."
