"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $180 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $140 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $180 to $160, and I think this product is worth more than $150. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
