# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for a quick sale for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
