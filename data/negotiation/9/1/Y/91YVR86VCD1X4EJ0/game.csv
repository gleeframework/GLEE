"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $800,000?  That feels like a more reasonable starting point.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm serious about purchasing it.  While I appreciate your movement, that price is still outside my budget.  Could we meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. However, the value of this product is firmly above $950,000. I'm prepared to make another adjustment, but it needs to reflect the true worth of what I'm offering. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
