"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, but that's the highest I can go at this time.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, we're still quite far apart.  To be completely transparent, I have other interested parties for this product at a higher price point. I'm willing to negotiate with you because I see the value it would bring you, but I need to see a more significant move from your side.  Would you consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm serious about purchasing this product at a fair price. I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer $1,250,000. However, this is my final offer, as I believe it represents a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need you to understand the value of this product.  My final offer is $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true benefit you'll gain.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to proceed with my other option.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
