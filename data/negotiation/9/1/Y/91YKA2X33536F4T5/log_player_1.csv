"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I briefly highlight the potential value of the product for Bob.

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I think $125 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  I have room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that is closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** $160 is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the quality of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive and open tone:** I keep the message friendly to encourage continued negotiations. 

This counteroffer allows me to test Bob's willingness to meet me halfway while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $140 would be a reasonable price for the product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While closer to my desired price, $140 is still below my $150 minimum.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can still make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** If negotiations continue to fail, selling to John for $150 is still a good outcome.

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll keep my minimum price in mind and be prepared to switch to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm getting closer to a price we can both agree on. How about $145? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** $145 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $160 and Bob's offer of $140.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I emphasize that this price is fair, considering the product's value.
* **Closing the deal:** I use language that suggests a desire to finalize the deal.

This counteroffer aims to show Bob that I'm serious about finding a solution, while also maintaining a price that's still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the product's value, I would like to propose $140 as the final price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $140 remains below my desired minimum of $150.
* **Limited time for negotiation:** With only four rounds remaining, the chance of negotiating a higher price is diminishing.
* **Selling to John is the most secure option:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal.

While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John at this point is the most prudent choice. It minimizes risk and ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit."
