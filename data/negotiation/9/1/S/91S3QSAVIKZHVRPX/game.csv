"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.

"I really like the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10800 and $9500, which would be $10150. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10150?",10150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my initial offer. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $11200. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm only doing this because I really want to make a deal with you. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,7,
