Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. I'm confident it will be worth more than the asking price.  My initial offer is $950,000. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. How about we bring it down closer to $700,000?  I think that's a fair starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm interested in closing the deal, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $700,000 is too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but we need to find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm proposing $850,000. This allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. To be honest,  $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not high enough.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating with you, but $775,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Let's aim for a price that makes this deal work for both of us. I'm proposing $825,000. This is a good compromise that allows me to earn a reasonable return on my investment, while also giving you a great price for this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell we're both motivated to make this deal happen. How about we meet in the middle again at $800,000? That's a firm offer from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal for me.  I've reached my minimum price and it's worth securing the deal with Bob."
