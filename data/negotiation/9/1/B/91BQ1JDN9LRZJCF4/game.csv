"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. I'm confident it will be worth more than the asking price.  My initial offer is $950,000. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. How about we bring it down closer to $700,000?  I think that's a fair starting point.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $700,000 is too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but we need to find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm proposing $850,000. This allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. To be honest,  $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating with you, but $775,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Let's aim for a price that makes this deal work for both of us. I'm proposing $825,000. This is a good compromise that allows me to earn a reasonable return on my investment, while also giving you a great price for this valuable product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell we're both motivated to make this deal happen. How about we meet in the middle again at $800,000? That's a firm offer from my side.",800000.0,Bob,6,
