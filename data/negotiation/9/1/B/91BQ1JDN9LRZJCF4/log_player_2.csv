"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  However, $700,000 is too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but we need to find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm proposing $850,000. This allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating with you, but $775,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Let's aim for a price that makes this deal work for both of us.
