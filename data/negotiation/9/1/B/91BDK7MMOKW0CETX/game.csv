"Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but based on my needs and budget, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while hopefully still fitting within your budget.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must respectfully decline the offer of $1,550,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000 again, hoping for a mutual agreement that respects both our positions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still finding it hard to agree to $1,500,000. This product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return.  How about we settle on $1,525,000? This represents a compromise from both sides and feels like a fair deal.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
