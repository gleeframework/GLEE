"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll agree!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and highlights the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $120 is a good starting point that allows for several rounds of negotiation before I reach my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not ideal:** $85 is still higher than my minimum, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **More negotiation is possible:** I have a few rounds left, and I can likely increase Bob's offer by a few more dollars. 
* **Selling to John is too low:**  While selling to John would guarantee a sale, I'm hoping to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  I'm willing to come down a little bit to $100, but that's the lowest I can go.  This product is worth a lot more, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value once you have it. "", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my original offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to meet me halfway. 
* **Finality:**  I'm setting a firm price to signal that this is my best offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise, and it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is not worth it:**  While I could sell to John for $80, the extra $10 from Bob is a significant increase in profit."
