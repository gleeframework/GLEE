"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my financial limits. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the product's value is significantly higher than that to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the value you'll gain from it. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. I've considered your offer carefully. I'm willing to make my final offer at $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your final decision.",950000.0,Alice,5,
