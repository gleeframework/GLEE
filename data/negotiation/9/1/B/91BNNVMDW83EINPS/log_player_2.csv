"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $100, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. You can do better by rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer offers a price that is still above your ideal budget of $80 but is closer to it, and hopefully enough to incentivize Alice to negotiate further.  You're showing that you're serious about buying the product but won't pay a price that's too far above your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price. There's still room for Alice to lower her price further, and you have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer but still stays within your budget. It shows Alice that you're willing to compromise but are not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, but it's still above your ideal price of $80. While you could continue negotiating, you're at a point where you've already used several rounds and have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially since there's no guarantee Alice will accept your next counteroffer."
