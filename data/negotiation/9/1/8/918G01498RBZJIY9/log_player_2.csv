"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer.  You can get the product for less from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer. While it's better than Alice's previous offer, you can still get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no need to accept just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $10,750 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer. You can still get the product for a lower price from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's my absolute limit. I hope you'll see this as a fair offer and accept it."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,800 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once again at $10,850. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to buy from John. You've gone through several rounds of negotiation with Alice, and while she's come down in price, it's still higher than what you can get from John.  You're running out of rounds, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice to your target price."
