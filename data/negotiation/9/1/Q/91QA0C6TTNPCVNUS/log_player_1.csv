Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have more negotiation rounds to explore with Bob, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price still gives me a decent profit while allowing you to acquire a valuable product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500, which is the highest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant distance away. I have more rounds left to negotiate and am confident that I can get closer to my target price. John is a reliable buyer, but I'm not willing to sell for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really keen on this product. I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $11,500 just doesn't work for me. How about $12,000? It's the absolute minimum I can accept. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to avoid selling to John. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
