"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a little more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?",80.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to get closer to the sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $81.25. It's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's worth it. What do you think?",81.25,Alice,5,
