Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my goal, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down to my $900,000 target before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the value of the product and your interest in it, I am willing to offer it to you for $960,000. This price aims to balance both our interests and ensure a fair transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $960,000 is within my budget and a good compromise. It's only $60,000 more than my desired price of $900,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll get firm on this price or reject my next offer.  It's also worth noting that if I go to John, I'll be paying $1,000,000. So, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money at this point."
