"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and I respect the value of your product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $10,500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, while also being closer to what I am willing to pay.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,500 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This gives you a good deal and me a fair price. ",11500.0,Alice,5,
