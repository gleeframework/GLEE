"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that will leave us both very satisfied. I'm confident this is a deal you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and go with John, who will sell you the product for your maximum budget."
