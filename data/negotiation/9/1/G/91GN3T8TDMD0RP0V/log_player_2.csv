Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think $95 is a bit too low, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can do $105. That's the best I can do.

You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go below $105, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John for $100 guarantees the best possible price."
