Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling, $750,000 is too low for me.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.  I'll counter with a new offer."

While $775,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a more agreeable price."
