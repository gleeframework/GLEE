**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet Alice's minimum acceptable price within a reasonable timeframe. The difference between his current offer ($975,000) and Alice's valuation ($1,200,000) is still significant. Accepting further counteroffers risks leaving money on the table. 

John offers a guaranteed sale at Alice's desired price. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal and move on, rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
