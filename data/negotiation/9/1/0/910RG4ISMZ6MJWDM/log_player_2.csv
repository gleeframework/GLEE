"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for a lower price.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This still leaves you a healthy profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective valuations."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still looking to get a good profit from the sale. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves me with a significant profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer again. He can likely get a lower price, and buying from John would mean a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $850,000, and I'm willing to offer $860,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $870,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a significant profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to get a slightly better price, Alice is clearly not willing to go below $870,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, as he'll save $130,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that he could get a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
