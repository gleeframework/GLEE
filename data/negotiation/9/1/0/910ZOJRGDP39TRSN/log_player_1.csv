Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a significant value considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price without revealing your true bottom line.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a (small) incentive to accept rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
