"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $8,000 is well below my minimum threshold. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm offering $12,000 as a counteroffer. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum threshold. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to consider a higher price while remaining within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. There are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering $11,000 as a counteroffer. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also that I still value the product above $10,000.  I'm hoping this will be enough to push Bob closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not confident I can reach a mutually acceptable price with him. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a reasonable profit and avoids risking further negotiation rounds that might lead to an even lower price."
