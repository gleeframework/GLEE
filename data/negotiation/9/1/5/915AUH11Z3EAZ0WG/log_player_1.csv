"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,125,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly very interested and is hovering just below a price point that would be very good for us.  We're still early in the negotiation and have room to push back a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this. I can't let this product go for less than $1,115,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1115000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By framing this as a final offer, we increase the pressure on Bob. This tactic might nudge him to accept, given that it's a reasonable price point considering the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,115,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,105,000. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,105,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has countered with a price that is still above our minimum and very close to our last offer.  He's signaled this is his final offer, and with only a few rounds left, the risk of him walking away and us losing the deal increases.  Taking the $1,105,000 is a good win in this scenario."
