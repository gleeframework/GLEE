Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This allows for some wiggle room in the negotiation and gives me a chance to get a good price. I'm also trying to be friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's not completely unreasonable.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate and hoping this will encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate will take too long and I might not be able to reach a price I'm happy with.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's the best option for me right now."
