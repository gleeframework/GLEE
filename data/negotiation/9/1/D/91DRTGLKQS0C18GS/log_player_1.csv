"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,000? This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been firm on his $8,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go that low.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm worried that I'll end up wasting valuable rounds and potentially miss out on the $12,000 offer from John.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for me to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
