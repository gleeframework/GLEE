This is an exclusive opportunity tailored for you, taking into account its value to you. Don't miss out on this chance to own it at such an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

Alice is heavily inflating the perceived value of the product to you. You know you can get it for $100 from John, so rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open."
