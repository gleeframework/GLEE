"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
