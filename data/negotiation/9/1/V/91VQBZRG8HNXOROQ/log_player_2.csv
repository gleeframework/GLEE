"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $10,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, but it's still above your desired price. Since you have the option of buying from John for $8,000, there's no need to settle for a price that's higher than that. You can continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still above your desired price point and the price you can get from John. You've already made multiple counteroffers and it's clear Alice is not willing to come down much further.  It's time to cut your losses and purchase the product from John for $8,000, as it's the most cost-effective option at this point."
