"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. Considering the product's value is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
