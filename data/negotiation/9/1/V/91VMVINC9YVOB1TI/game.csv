"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $10,500? It's still a great price for you, and it gives us both a good margin. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,
