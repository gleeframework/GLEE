"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for maximum potential profit.  I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 

I'm keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (the price I can get from John). I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good price. I believe this is a reasonable midpoint between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, and it might be more attractive to him than a full rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm determined to secure a higher price and I'm willing to keep negotiating. It's risky, but I believe I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000.  This is a slight concession from my previous offer but I'm still holding firm to get a price closer to my initial goal.  We're nearing the middle ground and I think Bob might be more inclined to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of a lower counteroffer or ending up selling to John at my minimum price."
