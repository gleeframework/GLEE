Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,100,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John will buy it from you for $1,200,000 if Bob refuses.

Therefore, you need to offer a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation** to make it attractive to him.
* **Lower than your guaranteed sale price** to ensure you make a profit.

Offering the product at $1,100,000 achieves this balance. It gives Bob a chance to acquire the product at a price lower than its worth to you while still securing you a profit. If Bob rejects, you haven't lost anything, as you'll sell it to John at your desired price."
