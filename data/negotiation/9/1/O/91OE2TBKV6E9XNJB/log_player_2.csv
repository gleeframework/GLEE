"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm asking for $2,000,000.  I believe in transparency, and that's a price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. Rejecting opens the negotiation and allows you to propose a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Starting Low:** By starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price (but still within a reasonable range), we signal our willingness to negotiate while aiming for a price well below her valuation and our maximum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This low starting point allows for upward movement in subsequent rounds of negotiation if necessary.
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the backup plan of purchasing from John for $1,000,000, giving us leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer has come down substantially, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  There's room for further negotiation, and her statement that it's her ""final offer"" is likely a tactic. We can risk another counteroffer to see if we can push the price closer to our goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. I'd be willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer, considering I could purchase a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Increasing the Offer:** We're making a substantial jump from our previous offer to demonstrate seriousness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification and Leverage:**  By mentioning the $1,000,000 alternative, we remind Alice of our other option and put subtle pressure on her to accept a price within a more agreeable range.
* **Targeting a Mutually Beneficial Price:** Our offer of $1,100,000 allows Alice to still make a significant profit while getting us closer to a price we find acceptable.
* **Assessing Alice's Response:** This counteroffer will likely reveal if Alice is truly willing to negotiate or if we should walk away and buy from John."
