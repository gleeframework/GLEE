Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. I'd be willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer, considering I could purchase a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
