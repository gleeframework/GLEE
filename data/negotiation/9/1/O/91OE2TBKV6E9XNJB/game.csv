"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm asking for $2,000,000.  I believe in transparency, and that's a price that reflects its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. I'd be willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer, considering I could purchase a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
