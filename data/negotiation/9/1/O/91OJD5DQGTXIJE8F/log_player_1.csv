"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm starting with a friendly message, expressing my belief in the value of the product for Bob. This helps build a positive rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly stating that I'm open to discussion and am not trying to pressure Bob into accepting immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity to counteroffer:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Staying Flexible:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to see if we can find common ground. This reflects the value I know this product holds.  Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not capitulation:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by dropping my price from $18,000 to $15,000. This is a significant drop, but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, reinforcing my belief that $15,000 is a fair price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging further dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my absolute maximum. If that works for you, I'm ready to buy. Let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **No further room for negotiation:** I've already lowered my price significantly, and there's little chance of getting more from Bob. 
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing a deal. 

While I could try to counteroffer for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee he'll accept. This is a good deal and a safe choice to secure the sale."
