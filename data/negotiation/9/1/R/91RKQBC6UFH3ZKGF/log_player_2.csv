"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Would you like to proceed with purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $105 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. That's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range he's willing to pay. This sets a starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value you place on our product, I'd like to offer it to you for $90. This is a bit higher than your offer, while still allowing us to cover our costs and maintain profitability. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $80.  It's better for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate further. He can use John as leverage if the negotiation with Alice stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $87.50.  Let's meet in the middle, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his maximum price and Alice's offer.  By offering $87.50, he's showing his willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. He's also appealing to Alice's desire to close the deal and avoid losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To accommodate you, I am willing to offer the product at $89. This price reflects a reasonable compromise, considering both the value you see in the product and our business needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $89 is close to Bob's maximum price, he can still try to negotiate a bit further. He might be able to get Alice to come down to $88 or even $87.50.  The risk is that if he rejects this offer, Alice might get stubborn or walk away, making John the only option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $89 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $88.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is pushing for a final price close to his maximum.  He's hoping that Alice, having already come down significantly from her initial offer, will see $88 as a reasonable compromise and accept it.  If she doesn't, he can still turn to John as a backup."
