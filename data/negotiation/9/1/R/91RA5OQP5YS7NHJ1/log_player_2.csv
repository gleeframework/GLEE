Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $9,000 is my final offer. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $9,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which aligns with your budget and saves you money. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the deal with John."
