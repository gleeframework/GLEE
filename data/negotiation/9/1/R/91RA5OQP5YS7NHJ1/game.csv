"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point, but $14,000 is still too high for my budget. I could consider going up to $7,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,500? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $10,500 is still pushing my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500, which I believe is a fair offer considering my budget limitations. Do you think that could work?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $9,000 is my final offer. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment. ",9000.0,Alice,7,
