Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However,  I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This still leaves you with a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.
