"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $12,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than Alice's perceived value, you know you can get the product for significantly less from John ($8,000). Rejecting this offer opens the door to a better deal."
