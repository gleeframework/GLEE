Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,000,000?

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000? This price reflects both the product's potential and my willingness to negotiate."",

# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial statement. We're getting closer to a price point where I might accept, but there's still room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This reflects a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll see excellent return on this investment."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. My final counteroffer is $1,325,000. I hope this proposal allows us to move forward while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear this is his final offer. While I could push for a slightly higher price, $1,325,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum, and waiting any longer risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
