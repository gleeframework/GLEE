``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, but not so high that Bob immediately rejects the offer.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price than John's offer, but it's good to have that as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's not completely unreasonable. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident I can get closer to $1,750,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is the lowest I can go at this point. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit far off. I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Bob is still coming in significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While selling to John is an option, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a deal with Bob closer to my desired price."
