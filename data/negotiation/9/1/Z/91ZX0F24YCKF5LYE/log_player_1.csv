Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price without revealing my hand.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I want to appear flexible and open to reaching a deal that works for both of us. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the safety net of John's offer ($1,000,000). If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gains.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's message suggests he's willing to negotiate further.  By rejecting his initial offer, I signal that I'm seeking a higher price and encourage him to improve his offer.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I have the security of John's $1,000,000 offer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. I'm not desperate to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer of $850,000, the value this product brings is considerably higher. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go below $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer ($100,000), demonstrating flexibility.  However, my new price remains comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the high value of the product to justify the price without being overly aggressive. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's valuation and mine. I'm signaling that I'm serious about selling but not desperate enough to accept an offer significantly below my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate the revised offer.  However, $1,200,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** Bob's latest offer of $950,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, the pace of negotiation is slow. It might take several more rounds to reach a price I find acceptable.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. There's no risk involved, and it meets my minimum price. 

**It's no longer worthwhile to continue negotiating with Bob. I can maximize my profit and minimize risk by selling the product to John.**"
