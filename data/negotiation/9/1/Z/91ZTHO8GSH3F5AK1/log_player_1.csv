Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for your needs and am willing to offer it at a special price of $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also creates the impression that he's getting a deal compared to a potential higher ""public"" price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning a public listing, you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity to a competitor if he hesitates.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob without completely discouraging him with an unrealistically high initial offer."
