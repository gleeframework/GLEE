Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so I need to offer it at a price that gives him a perceived surplus value.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so I can be slightly more aggressive with my pricing to Bob. 

By offering the product at $145, I'm giving Bob a chance to buy it for $25 less than his perceived value, while still securing a profit of $15 more than I'd get from John."
