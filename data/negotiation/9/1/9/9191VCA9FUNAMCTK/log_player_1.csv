Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this investment. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 9 rounds left and I'm hoping to get closer to my target price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. I have 6 rounds left and I'm hopeful that I can get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, but $1,275,000 is still too far below my target.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,300,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob. I've already rejected his offer twice at $1,250,000, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and move on."
