# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly motivated to sell as the product is only worth $1,200,000 to her.
* You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000, so you won't be left without the product. 
* By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for potential negotiation. She may come back with a lower price closer to her valuation to avoid losing the sale entirely."
