{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. I'll reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  This gives me room to potentially raise my offer if needed.  I'm aiming to get the price as close to my $12,000 maximum as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This would still give you a great deal on this amazing product.  Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating to get the price closer to my target. I'm hoping to leverage the fact that I can purchase the same product from John for $12,000 to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $14,000, which is still within my budget and a significant step closer to Alice's last offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in the product while still trying to keep the price down. I'm also using language that emphasizes that this is my final offer to create pressure for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $14000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15500?  I'm confident you'll agree that this is a great price for this fantastic product.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and bring the price down further. I'm hoping that the knowledge that I can buy the same product from John for $12,000 will motivate Alice to make a more attractive offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,000, which is my absolute final offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but I'm still staying within my budget. I've also emphasized that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency for Alice to accept. I'm trying to bridge the gap between our positions while keeping in mind that I can always go to John and pay $12,000."
