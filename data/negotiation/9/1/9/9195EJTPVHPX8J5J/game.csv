"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This would still give you a great deal on this amazing product.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $14000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15500?  I'm confident you'll agree that this is a great price for this fantastic product.  Let's make this happen!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13000, which is my absolute final offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
