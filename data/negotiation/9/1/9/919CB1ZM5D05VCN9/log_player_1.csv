Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My ideal price is closer to $150, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation Room:** I'm starting with $130 to leave room for negotiation. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but leaves space for him to make a counteroffer.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($150).**
* **John provides a guaranteed sale at a much higher price.** 
* **There's no reason to accept Bob's offer at this stage.** 

I will counteroffer Bob and try to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $60 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards the Middle:** My counteroffer of $100 is a significant move from my initial offer of $130, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**
* **John offers a guaranteed sale at a much higher price, and I'm not willing to risk losing that opportunity.** 
* **While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not comfortable accepting an offer that's significantly below my minimum.**

I will choose to sell the product to John for $150, as this ensures the best possible outcome for me."
