"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to negotiate, especially when you have a fallback option like John's offer.  Alice's opening price is high, and there's potential to get a better deal.  We'll see if we can lower the price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating. 
* **Fairness:**  $750,000 is a significant drop from Alice's opening price, but it's still within a range that reflects the potential value of the product to me.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone while being firm will help keep the negotiation moving in a constructive direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a slight improvement, but I'm still determined to get a better price.  Since we have more rounds to go, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the back-and-forth, potentially squeezing out an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer.  How about $800,000?  This reflects a fair value for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Approach:** Instead of making a big jump, I'm gradually inching closer to Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise without giving up too much.
* **Focus on Fairness:** Highlighting the ""fair value"" for both of us helps frame the negotiation as a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone, even as the negotiation tightens, encourages cooperation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $815000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $815,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $800,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep negotiating.
* **Value vs. Risk:** While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal, the risk of losing the opportunity entirely is high.  The current offer is within a range that makes sense for me, and the potential gain from further negotiation is small."
