"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than his maximum budget, he can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $95?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $95.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $105, Bob is still getting a good deal, saving $15 compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer makes sense as further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price and risks losing the deal altogether."
