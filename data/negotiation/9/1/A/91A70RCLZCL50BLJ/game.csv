"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a very competitive price of $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. Let's discuss this further and make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair price for the product.  Let's work together to find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can agree on this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
