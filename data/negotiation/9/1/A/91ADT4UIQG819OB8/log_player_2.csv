"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close as possible to Alice's minimum value of $8,000. By offering $8,500, Bob is showing willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $9,000 is a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product for a price that is lower than what John is offering and significantly closer to Bob's target price. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting the offer again and ultimately needing to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
