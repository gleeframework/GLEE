Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

While $105 is closer to my price range, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $97.50.  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97.50 is very close, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $102.50.  This is a fair price that allows me to reach my target while ensuring you get a great deal on this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $102.50 is still above my target price of $80. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds and I'm confident that I can get the product from John for a much better price. I'm going to buy from John."
