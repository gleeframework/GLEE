"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in selling this to you, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $97.50.  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97.50 is very close, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $102.50.  This is a fair price that allows me to reach my target while ensuring you get a great deal on this product.",102.5,Alice,5,
