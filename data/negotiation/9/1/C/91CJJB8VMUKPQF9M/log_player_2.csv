"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price.  We have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and probes her willingness to go lower. 
* **Respectful Tone:** The message maintains a polite and respectful tone to foster a positive negotiation environment.  
* **Clear Intention:**  We clearly state our desired price, leaving no ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $7,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved down in price, which is good, but we're still significantly above her value of $8,000.  We have time to negotiate further and try to reach a price closer to our target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $6,750?"",
""product_price"": 6750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing willingness to negotiate by increasing our offer, but keeping it below her current price.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":** This framing technique can be persuasive and suggests a fair compromise. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still comfortably below her value and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit above where I'd like to be, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I can do $7,200 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice continues to reduce her price, we're making progress and still have ample rounds for negotiation. There's a good chance we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I feel like we're getting closer.  Would you consider $6,900?  That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 6900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Incremental Increases:** We're sticking with our strategy of making small, upward adjustments to encourage Alice to move closer to our desired price point.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  By highlighting the fairness of the offer, we aim to create a sense of reciprocity and encourage Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Timing:**  With more than half the rounds remaining, we're positioned to continue negotiating without seeming overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to where I want to be, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $7,400 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is unusual. Alice has increased her price. It seems like she might be trying to test our resolve or signal that she's not willing to go much lower. We need to hold firm and see if she's truly willing to walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm a bit surprised by that. We seemed to be making good progress. I'm still happy to pay $6,900, but I need to be realistic with my budget."",
""product_price"": 6900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Express Surprise:** Acknowledging the unexpected price increase subtly signals that we're not easily swayed.
* **Stand Firm:**  We're reiterating our previous offer to show we're serious and not willing to be pushed higher. 
* **Budget Justification:** By mentioning our budget, we introduce an external factor that limits our flexibility, making our position more believable.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, we're increasing the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can do $7,100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're down to the final rounds, and Alice is unlikely to move significantly lower.  
* **Reasonable Price:**  While not ideal, $7,100 is a decent price compared to John's offer of $10,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If we push too hard, Alice might walk away, leaving us with John's higher price."
