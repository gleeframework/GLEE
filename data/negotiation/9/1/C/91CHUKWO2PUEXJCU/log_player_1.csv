Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product, and it's also below what I could get from John. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $12,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  John is willing to pay $10,000, which is a safer and more secure option.  I'll sell the product to John."
