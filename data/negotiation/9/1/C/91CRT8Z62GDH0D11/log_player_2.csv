"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. There's a good chance to negotiate a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product has value, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still comfortably above her perceived value. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed positively, acknowledging the product's value while explaining my budget constraints. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $9,000, I signal that I'm serious about buying but also expect Alice to move from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice moved a bit, $10,000 is still significantly higher than her known value of $8,000 and my target price.
* **Multiple Rounds Remaining:** We have plenty of rounds left to try and get closer to my desired price range. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  The option to buy from John for $12,000 gives me a fallback position. Alice knows this, so there's pressure on her to make a more compelling offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm still quite a ways away from that number, though.  Would you consider $9,300? "",
""product_price"": 9300
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but keeping it significantly below her current offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility. A strong negative reaction might suggest she's less willing to go much lower. 
* **Time Pressure:** As we progress through the rounds, the pressure increases on Alice to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about the product and I appreciate that.  $9,300 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming a bit higher. Would you be willing to do $9,800? I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice is moving closer to my range, the concessions are small. We're still significantly above her value.
* **Testing Resolve:**  I want to see how firm Alice is on this price. Rejecting this offer might prompt a more substantial counter from her. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're past the halfway point, but I'm comfortable letting the negotiation continue for another round or two. The potential savings still outweigh the risk of Alice walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I could possibly stretch my budget to $9,500.  That's really the limit for me though."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I'm offering a price slightly closer to Alice's last offer, but not quite meeting her in the middle. This shows a willingness to compromise, but also maintains a firm stance on my budget.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** The phrase ""That's really the limit for me""  subtly signals that this might be my final offer, encouraging Alice to seriously consider it.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Alice might walk away, the potential savings of $300 compared to her last offer and $2,500 compared to her initial offer make it worthwhile to push a bit further."
