"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential.
