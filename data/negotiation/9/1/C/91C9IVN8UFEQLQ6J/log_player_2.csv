"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $14,000. Given its value to you, I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while ensuring a good return for us. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000 on this product. Given its value to me, and your desired price point, I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we set the product price at $13,500? This still allows for a good profit margin for us, while remaining competitive compared to other market prices. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what he's willing to pay from John, and it's closer to his initial counteroffer.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely to get a price much lower, especially given Alice's revised offer."
