"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a significant price drop from your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's meet halfway.  I'm willing to reduce the price to $825,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product at this price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'd like to propose $812,500. This is a fair price for me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",812500.0,Bob,4,
