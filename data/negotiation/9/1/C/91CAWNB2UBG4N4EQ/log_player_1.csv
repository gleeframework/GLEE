Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a significant price drop from your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer him in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'd like to propose $812,500. This is a fair price for me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $812,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000. I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
