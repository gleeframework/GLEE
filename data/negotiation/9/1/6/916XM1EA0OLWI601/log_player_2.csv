{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is asking for $100.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still talking, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $105?
