{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  Alice's offer is $30 over Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Rejecting the offer opens the door for negotiation.**  Bob can try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but not the best choice yet.**  John's price is Bob's maximum, but there's still potential to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting low:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $140 is a bold move, but it's within the realm of possibility. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While Bob's ideal price is $150, starting lower gives him some leverage for negotiation.
* **Understanding Alice's minimum:** Alice likely won't accept $140 immediately, but it sets a clear lower bound for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.** $160 is only $10 above Bob's limit.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob could potentially get Alice down to $150 by making another counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still not the best option.**  While it's a guaranteed price, Bob has a chance to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

* **Last chance for a deal:**  If this counteroffer is rejected, Bob will have to make a tough decision in the next round."
