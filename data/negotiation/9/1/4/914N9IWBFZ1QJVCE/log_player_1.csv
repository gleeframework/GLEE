"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $15,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $12,800 makes the most sense at this point. It's a sure $800 profit compared to John's offer, and continuing the negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Bob lowering his offer."
