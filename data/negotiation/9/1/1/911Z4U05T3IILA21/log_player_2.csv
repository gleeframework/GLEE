"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm starting with a price of $90, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better price.  You can always buy from John later if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 seems a bit high for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget. It also gauges Alice's willingness to lower her price substantially."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but you're still closer to your goal. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to $70.  You're still under John's price, so there's some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $65 might have been a little low. How about we settle at $70? That seems like a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** You're splitting the difference between your last offer and her counter, showing willingness to compromise while pushing for a better deal.  $70 is a good target that's significantly below your max budget."
