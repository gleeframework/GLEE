"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm offering it for $150, which is a great deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This allows room for negotiation and potentially a good profit.
* **Positive and inviting:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I've left room for Bob to counter-offer, but I'm also establishing a clear starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $125. It's still a great value for the product, and it gives us both a good starting point for a deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price, but not by a huge margin. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target.  Would you consider $110?  It's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, and each round brings me closer to having to sell to John for $100.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting, I'm keeping the door open to potentially improve the deal in future rounds.  

I'm taking the offer to secure a sale, but I'm not ruling out the possibility of negotiating further to push the price up if the opportunity arises."
