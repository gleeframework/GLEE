"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value ($10,000).**  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.
* **I have 9 rounds left.**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option, but it's a last resort.** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $8,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value ($10,000).** While it's closer than before, I'm not willing to sell for less than my floor price.
* **I have 6 rounds left.** There's still potential for a better deal, and I want to continue negotiating.
* **Selling to John is a secure option, but it's not my ideal outcome.** I believe I can still get a price closer to my desired value with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're approaching the end of the negotiation with only 4 rounds remaining.**
* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value ($10,000).** It's unlikely he'll come up much further, and I'm running out of time.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value.** It's a safe and secure option that ensures I won't lose money on the deal.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement is too high, and I can't afford to waste any more time. John offers a reliable solution, and I need to secure my financial goals."
