"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to own something truly valuable at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. This means there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

While $90 is better than $95, it's still above my desired price point. I'll try to negotiate further with Alice before settling for John's $100 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $87.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product to you for $89. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $89, which is just $9 more than what the product is worth to her.  While I'd ideally like to pay even less,  this is a fair price considering John is selling for $100.  It's time to accept the offer and avoid risking further negotiation."
