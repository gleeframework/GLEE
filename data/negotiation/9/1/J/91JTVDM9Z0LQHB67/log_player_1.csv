Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than $8,000, giving Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially go down a little bit if Bob counteroffers, but you have a buffer.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the possibility of getting a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and counter-offer. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation.  Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay close to my minimum. 
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and demonstrate my willingness to hold out for a higher price. 

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference at $9,250? I'm confident this price is still a great value for you, and it'll allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given my budget, I'm unable to meet the price of $9,250. Would you consider accepting $9,100 for the product? I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $9,100. 

Here's why:

* **Close to my minimum:** $9,100 is only slightly below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might become less willing to negotiate or walk away altogether. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price. 

While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to balance potential profits with the risk of losing a sale."
