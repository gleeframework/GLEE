"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't go lower than that.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price that is close to my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **John's offer:** I have the safety net of John's offer, which gives me the leverage to be more aggressive in the initial offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I force Bob to make the first counter-offer. This gives me a better understanding of his willingness to pay and allows me to adjust my offers accordingly.  I will continue to leverage John's offer as a fallback if negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, making Bob's offer unappealing. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have 8 rounds left to negotiate and can potentially get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations.  I will use this round to gauge how flexible Bob is and to potentially start driving the price up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's low offer:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is too low.  
* **John's safety net:** I still have John's offer of $15,000, giving me the ability to be firm.
* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price above Bob's initial offer.

**Strategy:**

By offering $14,000, I'm aiming to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to budge. I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, keeping in mind my minimum price and the potential to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's stubbornness:** Bob has twice rejected my offers, indicating he's unlikely to budge significantly from his initial price. 
* **Time is ticking:** I've already had three rounds of negotiations, and I have limited time left.
* **John's certainty:** John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a much safer and more profitable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired price, I'm prioritizing certainty and minimizing risk.  It's better to secure a guaranteed deal with John now than to risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price from Bob."
