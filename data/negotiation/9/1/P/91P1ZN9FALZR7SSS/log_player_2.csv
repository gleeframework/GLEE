Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product is valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to finding a fair compromise, I can't go that low. I'm willing to lower my initial offer slightly to $1,650,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,425,000 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.
