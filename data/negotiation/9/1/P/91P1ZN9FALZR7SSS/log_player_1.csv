Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  Given its exceptional value, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and its potential for your business. I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product is valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down to $1,200,000?  That feels like a fairer starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's worth $1,500,000 to him, so $1,200,000 is significantly less than its actual value.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to finding a fair compromise, I can't go that low. I'm willing to lower my initial offer slightly to $1,650,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price I can work with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to the value I know the product is worth to him, but $1,425,000 is still too low. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,425,000 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
