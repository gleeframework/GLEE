Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'll offer you the product for $100. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us!

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $90. While she might budge a little more, it's not worth the risk of going over your $80 budget. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs."
