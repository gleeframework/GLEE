"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
