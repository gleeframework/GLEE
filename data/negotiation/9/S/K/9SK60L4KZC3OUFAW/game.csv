"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $165. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm counteroffering at $155. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and I'm getting close to my minimum price.",155.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made my last compromise at $160. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm still open to discussing, but I need to be fair to myself.",160.0,Alice,9,
