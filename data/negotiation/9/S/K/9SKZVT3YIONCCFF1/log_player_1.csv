Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its worth, I'm asking for $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can afford to start with a much higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest level and potential budget.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiation skills:** I need to be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or try to negotiate the price down. 
* **Time sensitivity:** If I'm in no rush, I can afford to hold out for a higher offer from Bob. However, a quick sale to John provides immediate certainty.

This initial offer sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation with Bob."
