"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. Let's meet halfway.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to achieve a reasonable return. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can agree.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
