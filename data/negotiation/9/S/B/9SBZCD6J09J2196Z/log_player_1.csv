{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum desired price:**  This makes the offer attractive to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives you some leverage and potentially encourages him to counteroffer.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have space to adjust the price in subsequent rounds.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale.  By offering a price that's attractive to Bob, you increase the chances of a successful negotiation and avoid having to sell to John at your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a significant profit for Bob, it's far below your minimum desired price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing a substantial amount of money. 

**Next Steps:**

You should reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. You can try a counteroffer that is still above Bob's valuation but closer to your minimum desired price. This will allow you to potentially get a better deal while still remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant value for you. This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal, and I believe this product would be a great addition to your operations. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This shows willingness to negotiate and increases the chance of Bob accepting.
* **Staying above your minimum:**  $900,000 is still within your desired range and ensures you don't lose out on substantial profit.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** This helps maintain a good relationship with Bob and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation. 

This counteroffer balances your desire for a good price with the need to remain flexible and avoid losing Bob as a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still working within a tight budget and would like to keep the price at $800,000 if possible. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been adamant about his $800,000 budget, and it seems unlikely he'll budge further.  While continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly higher price, it's a gamble that could ultimately cost you time and potentially result in a lower final sale price.

Selling to John guarantees you your minimum desired price of $1,200,000, securing a substantial profit and avoiding any further risk of negotiation.  

**Decision:**

To maximize your profit and minimize risk, it's best to sell the product to John."
