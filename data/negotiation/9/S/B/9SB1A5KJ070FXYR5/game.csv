"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true value of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my budget. I believe this is a good compromise that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let me know your decision.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
