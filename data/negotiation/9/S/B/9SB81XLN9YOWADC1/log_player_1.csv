Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly.  It's important to remember that I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting too close to my minimum value. I'm not confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer of $1,000,000. It's better to guarantee the minimum value than to risk getting nothing at all."
