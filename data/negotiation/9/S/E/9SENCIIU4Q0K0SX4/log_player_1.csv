"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows for some negotiation space, but it also establishes a strong starting point.  I'm aiming to get the highest price possible from Bob, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option for $100 if the negotiations don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I'm not yet ready to settle for less.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  However, I'm keeping John as a backup option in case the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $110. Would you be willing to consider $105?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  This shows flexibility, while also demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much.  I'm also reminding Bob of my initial offer to anchor his perception of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm not yet ready to settle for less than $100, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob.  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. John remains a backup option if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and also a fair compromise.  I'm highlighting the fairness of the offer to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.  It's a strategic move to aim for a quick closure while still getting a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $97.50 is a better deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of time and rounds.  It's risky to continue negotiating with Bob, especially since John is a guaranteed buyer for $100.  To ensure a certain sale and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John."
