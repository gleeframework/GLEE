"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $90?  I'm ready to buy it at that price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to give you a small discount, so how about we meet at $105? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,5,
