"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, showing flexibility, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, and even below my initial offer of $12,000.  While I want to close the deal, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $11,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I appreciate you moving down on the price.  How about we split the difference at $10,000?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly the value he places on the product. While it's less than I initially hoped for, it's still a profitable deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  It's also a fair compromise and avoids the need to keep bargaining.  Since there are only 6 rounds left, it's more strategic to accept this offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale."
