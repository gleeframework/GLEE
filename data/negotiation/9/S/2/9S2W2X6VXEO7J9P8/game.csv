"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $500000? I believe this might be within the range that aligns better with our current financial situation.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $500000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I am willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose we meet in the middle at $1250000. This price still reflects the value of the product, while leaving room for a profitable deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I propose we aim for a price closer to $800000. This would allow for a fair transaction while accommodating my financial limitations.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $800000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I propose we meet at $1000000.  This price would allow for a fair deal for both of us, acknowledging the value of the product and your budget constraints.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
