"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $1,300,000 is my best price at this time.  It still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's a fair compromise for the value of this product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can close the deal at that price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
