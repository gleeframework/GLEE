"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. This is my final offer on that price, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $8000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,5,
