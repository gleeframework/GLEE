Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $950,000. I know this product would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** Starting at $950,000 is high enough to potentially maximize profit but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the product's significant value to both of you.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the price as fair, increasing the chances of acceptance."
