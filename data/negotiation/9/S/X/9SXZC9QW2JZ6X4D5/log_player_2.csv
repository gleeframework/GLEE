"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120, which is fair value for both of us.  Would you be interested in buying it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice offers a fair price, there's no harm in trying to get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, you can see if she'll lower the price. If not, you can always buy from John at the same price."
