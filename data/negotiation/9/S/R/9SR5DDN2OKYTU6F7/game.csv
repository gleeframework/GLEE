"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's keep talking!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
