# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $95. This is an exclusive opportunity to own this product at a discounted rate. Please let me know if you're interested in securing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the perceived value to you ($100) while knowing her own valuation is much lower ($80).  
* This suggests she has room to negotiate down further.
* You have a backup option (John) at $100, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's first offer."
