Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your operations.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's aiming for a significantly lower point than my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
