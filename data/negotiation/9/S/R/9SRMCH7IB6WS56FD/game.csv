"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your operations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This recognizes the value it brings while acknowledging your initial feedback.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
