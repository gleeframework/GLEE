"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm looking for something closer to $8,500.  Let's try to find some common ground here.",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,750 still doesn't work for me.  How about we compromise at $8,250? This is a fair price that's closer to my value for the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
