"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Buying from John saves you $400,000 and meets your goal of spending no more than $1,000,000."
