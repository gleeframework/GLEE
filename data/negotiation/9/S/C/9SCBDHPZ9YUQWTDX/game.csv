"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, how about $13000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,
