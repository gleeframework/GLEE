"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. It's in my best interest to reject and start negotiating. I can potentially save a significant amount by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, your initial offer is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get closer to my target price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product can be a great asset for both of us, but I can't go beyond my budget of $850,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desire to sell.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $920,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also giving you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my limit.  I can potentially negotiate further and try to get closer to my target price of $800,000. I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $920,000 is still too high for me.

Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really eager to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is a bit closer to your target price. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I want to see if I can convince Alice to go even lower, or if she's truly at her final offer. I still have some rounds to play with, so it's worth trying to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you want to close the deal, and I do too.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $890,000, which is a strong offer and reflects the value I place on this product.  Let's find common ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $895,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $895,000 is close to my target price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure with only one round left.  If I reject this offer, I risk Alice sticking to her final price or even backing out completely. While saving $5,000 sounds good,  the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high.  I'm confident I can get the product from John for a lower price, so I'll take the guaranteed deal and avoid any further uncertainty."
