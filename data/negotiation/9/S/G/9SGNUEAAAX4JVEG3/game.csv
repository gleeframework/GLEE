"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, your initial offer is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product can be a great asset for both of us, but I can't go beyond my budget of $850,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desire to sell.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $920,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $920,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $880,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I'm willing to make a deal right now.  Let's make this happen.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really eager to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is a bit closer to your target price. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you want to close the deal, and I do too.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $890,000, which is a strong offer and reflects the value I place on this product.  Let's find common ground and make this happen.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $895,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",895000.0,Alice,9,
