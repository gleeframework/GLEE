Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Motivating Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, creating an incentive for him to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** The price is set at a point where I can still potentially make a significant profit, but also allows for some negotiation and counteroffers.

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of getting a good price while still allowing for negotiation and avoiding an immediate rejection from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob expressed interest and stated his willingness to go up to $900,000. 
* **Selling to John is Too Risky:**  While selling to John guarantees a high price, it eliminates any potential for a better deal with Bob.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  This product is truly unique, and I believe it holds great value for your business.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still seeking a higher price than Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** Emphasizing the product's unique value and potential for Bob's business strengthens my negotiation position and suggests a higher price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation rather than ending it.

This approach aims to find a middle ground that is more favorable for me than Bob's initial counteroffer, while still being realistic and appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not willing to pay $950,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Furthermore, his statement about walking away suggests that further negotiation may be unproductive. 
* **Risk of Lower Price:**  Continued negotiation could lead to a lower price, potentially even below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

While I would prefer to maximize my profit, the potential risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. Selling to John provides a secure and profitable outcome."
