{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth at least $200, but I'm willing to let it go for $180.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also adds a bit of enthusiasm and emphasizes the value of the product to potentially pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is your minimum, there's still room to negotiate. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. $150 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $165? That's still a great price for this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 165} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'll accept Bob's offer.  Although it's only $5 more than what John would pay, it's a better price than my last counteroffer, and it seems like Bob is firm on his price.  There's always a chance that continuing to negotiate could lower the price further, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's still acceptable to me."
