"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,500,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to John for the same amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth the same to you ($1,500,000) and to John, there's no benefit in buying from Alice.  You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to explore other options, potentially finding a better deal or a different product that better suits your needs."
