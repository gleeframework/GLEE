"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a rare and valuable product. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is very tempting, but I'm not quite ready to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this piece. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the original offer I made. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1700000. This is a fair compromise and would allow us to both walk away satisfied. ",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1700000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $1750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise. However, $1750000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1725000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
