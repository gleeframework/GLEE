"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $9,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,500 is closer to his maximum, he can still try to get a lower price. He knows he can buy from John for $8,000, so there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to settle for $8,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer is Too High:**  Alice's offer of $8,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 5 rounds left, Bob doesn't have a lot of room to negotiate further.
* **Guaranteed Price:** John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is within Bob's budget.

While Bob might be able to squeeze a slightly lower price from Alice, the risk of not closing the deal and the certainty of John's offer make buying from John the safer and more financially sound decision."
