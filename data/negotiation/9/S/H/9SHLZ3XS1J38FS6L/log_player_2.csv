Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  While John is offering a good price, there's a chance Bob could save even more by continuing the negotiation with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can still try to negotiate further, Alice's offer is only $25,000 more than John's price, and the risk of continuing the negotiation is that Alice could walk away or offer a worse price. It's a good compromise that saves Bob money without risking a worse outcome."
