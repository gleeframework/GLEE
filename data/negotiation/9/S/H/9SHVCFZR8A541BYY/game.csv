"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you want to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I can go.",8500.0,Bob,4,
