,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum target. Let's finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
