Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring immense value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth to you and my initial offer of $1,400,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  You're still within range of getting a deal that's better than John's offer, so it's worth continuing."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your budget of $1,200,000.  While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will continue to be stubborn and the negotiation could drag on.  It's more efficient to secure the product from John at your maximum budget and avoid the potential for further delays or failed negotiations."
