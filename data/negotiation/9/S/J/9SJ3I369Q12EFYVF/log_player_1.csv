This offer is a bit below my minimum value of $10,000 but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting a price closer to my goal. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to incentivize him to accept."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
