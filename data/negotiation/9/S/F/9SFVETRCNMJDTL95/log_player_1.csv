Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to my ideal price as possible.  It's a gamble, but I believe the product is valuable enough to warrant a high initial price.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm offering $1,900,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to accept his offer, as it's a good deal and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer.  It's better to secure a sale than to keep pushing and potentially end up with nothing."
