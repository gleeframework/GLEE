Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his upper limit might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price to my minimum, but I'm not going any lower. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still too low, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, so I'm going to sell to him."
