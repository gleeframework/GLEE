"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is still too far below my value. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be compensated fairly.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This gives us both a good deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000.  We're so close to a deal, though!  Let's compromise one last time. I'll meet you halfway at $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay.",12500.0,Alice,5,
