Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $110. Is this something you'd be interested in?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm offering it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $100 and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  You can get the product for your target price from John."
