Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification for Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than an expense.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $1,000,000 but lower than $1,500,000. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose anything because we can sell it to John for our minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming to get the best possible deal from Bob while ensuring we don't miss out on a guaranteed sale."
