"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $90 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?  This would still give you a great deal on the product, and allow me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.0,Bob,4,
