"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do any better on the price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. After re-evaluating our pricing strategy, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering the product for $1,100,000. We believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Could you consider $1,025,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value.",1025000.0,Bob,4,,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to make another concession. We're offering the product for $1,075,000. We believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1075000.0,Alice,5,,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,,
"Alice, this is getting us closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? It seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,,,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're getting close to a deal, but we're still not quite there. We're willing to make one more concession. We're offering the product for $1,075,000, but we'll throw in a premium service package worth $25,000. This package includes priority support and dedicated account management. We believe this added value will make the deal more attractive to you.",1075000.0,Alice,7,,25000.0,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,,
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not really in need of the premium service package. To be honest, $1,050,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're unable to meet that price, I might have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Bob,8,,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,,
"Bob, we understand your position, and we're willing to make one final concession. We're willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but we'll throw in a 1-year warranty extension, which is normally valued at $10,000. This will give you added peace of mind and protection for your investment. We believe this is a fair compromise that meets your needs and reflects the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,9,,,10000.0
