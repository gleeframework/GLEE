Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob interested.  Here's why:

* **My Gain:**  This price gives me a profit of $400,000, which is a significant amount.
* **Bob's Gain:** Bob still gets a $300,000 gain ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000). 
* **John's Alternative:**  While I could offer a slightly higher price to Bob, it's likely that he'd still be willing to pay this amount, as he values the product higher than my fallback price with John.

By setting the price at $1,200,000, I'm confident that I can secure a strong deal while leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good value."
