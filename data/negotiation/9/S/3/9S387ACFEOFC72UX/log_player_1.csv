Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.

I'm still holding out for a better price from Bob. We're making progress, and I believe I can still negotiate a higher price."

Bob seems to be stuck on $1,200,000. It's time to show him I'm serious about getting a better price and am willing to walk away.  I'll use the next counteroffer to nudge him upwards or be prepared to go to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find a price that works for both of us. However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to my operations and the market value of similar products.

Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting his offer of $1,275,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in the final rounds."
