"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. Given its worth, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting both its inherent worth and the benefit it will bring to your operations.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering the value it will bring to my operations and the market value of similar products.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but the value of this product is substantial.  How about we settle at $1,325,000? That's a significant reduction from my initial ask and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to my operations and the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find a price that works for both of us. However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000. To make this deal worthwhile for me, I need you to be closer to my previous offer.  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, but this is my final offer. ",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to my operations and the market value of similar products.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
