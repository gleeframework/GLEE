Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,100,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $950,000 is my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true potential of this product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price. To be frank, I need to get at least $900,000 for this to make sense for me. How about we split the difference and call it $825,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000.  While you might be able to haggle her down a little more, it's not worth the risk of losing the $800,000 deal with John.  You've gotten far enough in the negotiation to know that John's offer is your best option."
