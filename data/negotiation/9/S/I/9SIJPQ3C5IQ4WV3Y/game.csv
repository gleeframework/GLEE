"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While your valuation is understandable, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances the product's value with my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer, but I'm still a bit above your price. I'd like to make one last counteroffer of $1,800,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this number.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
