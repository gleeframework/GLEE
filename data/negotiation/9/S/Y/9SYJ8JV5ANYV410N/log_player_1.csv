"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is designed to be polite but firm, gauging Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping the John offer ($800,000) in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my target price.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try to reach a more favorable agreement. I'll aim for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant gain."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $900,000, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate while holding firm on a price that represents a substantial profit for me. This classic negotiation tactic can often lead to a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential gain he stands to make while subtly anchoring the negotiation closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value this product, but $900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm happy to increase my offer to $875,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's worth while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $875,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000). Accepting now secures a favorable outcome.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob's offer has increased steadily, indicating a strong desire for the product.  
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer or me missing out on a good deal. Accepting now eliminates that risk."
