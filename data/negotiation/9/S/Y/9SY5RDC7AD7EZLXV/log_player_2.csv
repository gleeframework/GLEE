"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's initial offer might lead to a better counter-offer closer to her $800,000 valuation."
