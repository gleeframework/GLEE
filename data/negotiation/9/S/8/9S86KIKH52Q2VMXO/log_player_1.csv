"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial High Offer:**  Starting with a high price, even if unrealistic, establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob creates a sense of potential gain for him, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussing the price, which suggests flexibility and a willingness to find a compromise.

**Note:** This is a high initial offer, knowing Bob's maximum is $800,000. This allows for room to negotiate down while still potentially earning a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant financial loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  I believe I can push for a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. This gives me leverage and the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm happy to offer the product for $1,700,000. This price still allows you a substantial gain while also ensuring I can meet my own financial goals.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  
* **Highlighting Potential Gain:**  The message emphasizes that the price still represents a significant benefit for Bob.
* **Seeking Collaboration:** The phrase ""let's work together"" emphasizes a desire to find a mutually agreeable outcome. 
* **Maintaining My Floor:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out financially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures I don't lose any money and achieve my financial goal.
* **No Room for Improvement:**  Bob has clearly stated his budget constraints, indicating that further negotiation is unlikely to result in a higher price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John would yield the same amount of money, this offer allows me to close the deal sooner and avoid potential delays or further negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision as it allows me to secure the desired price without further risk or uncertainty."
