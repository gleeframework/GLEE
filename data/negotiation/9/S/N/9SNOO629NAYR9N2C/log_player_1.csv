Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $10,000 (your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $12,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $2,000 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $12,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  It's generally better to start high and leave room for negotiation.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps it polite, highlights the product's value to Bob, and opens the door for negotiation.
* **The Price:**  Starts high but leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still securing a significant profit for you. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower, around $11,000.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  How important is it to get the absolute highest price, even if it means a slightly higher chance of Bob rejecting the offer?
