"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $950,000?  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This price still leaves me with a good margin, and I'm confident that the product will bring you a lot of value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that the product will be valuable to me.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and it's still a price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there!  I understand you need to make a profit, but $975,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.  Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,8,

"I can see that we're really close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not going to budge from there. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to call it a day at this point. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,9,
