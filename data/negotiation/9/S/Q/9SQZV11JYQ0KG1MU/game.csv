"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. It's a game changer and I know it will be immensely valuable to you.  My starting price is $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $850,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,025,000 is still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $900,000?  I feel that's a strong offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While I'm eager to make this deal work, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000.  This price is a significant compromise from my initial offer and represents a fair value for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement. How about we settle at $920,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",920000.0,Bob,6,
