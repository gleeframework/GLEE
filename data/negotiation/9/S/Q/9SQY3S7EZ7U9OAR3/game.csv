"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the potential savings it provides. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
