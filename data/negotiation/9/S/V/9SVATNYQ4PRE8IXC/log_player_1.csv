Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point.**  It's significantly higher than my minimum price ($12,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob.**  This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If negotiations stall or seem unproductive, I can always sell to John for $12,000, guaranteeing I won't lose money."
