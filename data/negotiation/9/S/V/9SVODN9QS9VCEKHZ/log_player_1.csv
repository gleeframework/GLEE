Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and encourages further conversation. I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive while leaving room for potential counteroffers.
* **Prepared for Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away at any moment and sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation stalls. This provides leverage and helps me stay firm on my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than his perceived value of $800,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.  I need to continue negotiating or sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  It's clear you see value in this product, so let's work towards a price that is fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let me know if this is something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not completely shutting down the negotiation. My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than his offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him.  This helps reinforce the potential he sees in the product.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm emphasizing the desire to find a price that works for both of us. This maintains a collaborative tone.
* **Prepared for Plan B:** I'm still prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations break down. This is my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment.  Would you consider $700,000? That seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell this product for such a drastic reduction in price.  It's time to move on to the more secure option of selling to John for the full amount I'm comfortable with."
