Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  It's clear you see value in this product, so let's work towards a price that is fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let me know if this is something you can work with.
