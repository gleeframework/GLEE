""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,350,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a range that's highly profitable for you.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**The offer of $1,350,000:**

* **Attractive to Bob:**  Still saves Bob $150,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Highly Profitable for Alice:**  Nets Alice $350,000 above her minimum acceptable price."
