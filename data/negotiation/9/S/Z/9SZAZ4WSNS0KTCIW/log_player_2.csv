"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what you could get it for from John.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counteroffer is a starting point in the negotiation. It is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying within a reasonable range of your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above your ideal budget and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the consideration, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We are edging closer to your budget and putting a bit more pressure on Alice. This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between her previous offer and your previous counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I still need to make a profit. How about $115? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems Alice is not budging much from her last offer. It's unlikely you'll get the price down to a level you're happy with. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $100."
