"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit too high. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to start with this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to consider a figure in that range?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Considering the product's value and the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
