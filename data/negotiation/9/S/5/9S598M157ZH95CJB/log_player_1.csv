"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. I believe $175 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is too low. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price to $160, which is still above my minimum of $150. I believe this is a fair compromise, given that Bob rejected my initial offer of $175.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, as selling to John for $150 would be a better outcome at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $145. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  I believe Bob might be more willing to accept this offer as it's getting closer to his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $150.  While Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
