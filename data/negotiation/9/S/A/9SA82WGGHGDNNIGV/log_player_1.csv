Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still netting us a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a fallback, ensuring we won't be forced to go below $800,000.

This strategy aims for the highest possible price Bob is likely to accept, knowing we have a guaranteed sale at a lower price if needed."
