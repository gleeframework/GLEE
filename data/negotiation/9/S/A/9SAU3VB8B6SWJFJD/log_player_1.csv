""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above the Reserve Price:**  The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000 from John), ensuring a substantial profit."
