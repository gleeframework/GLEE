{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Alice's initial offer is close to your maximum, but there's still room to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that's reasonable given my budget. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also establishing a firm price point. If Alice rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get her down to $900,000.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to push for a lower price.  This is a smaller increment than my previous counteroffer, indicating I'm getting closer to my acceptable price point. If Alice accepts, I get a good deal. If she rejects, I have more room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my desired price, but I'm getting closer.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can push her down to $910,000.  Rejecting her offer gives me more room to maneuver in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 915000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving closer to Alice's offer but still pushing for a lower price. This shows my willingness to compromise while still holding out for a better deal. If Alice accepts, I've secured a good price. If she rejects, I can continue to negotiate with a few rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $918,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $918,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my desired price point. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, and I could end up paying more or running out of time. It's also possible that John will become less willing to sell to me if he realizes I'm still negotiating with Alice.  Therefore, it makes sense to accept this offer and secure a good price before the situation changes."
