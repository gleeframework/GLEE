"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? This would still be a significant savings for you compared to my original offer.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion of $13,500. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to further reduce the price to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, and I'm happy to try to find a compromise. However, $12,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This would still give you a significant discount and allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. This is still below your original asking price, but it brings us closer to my budget limit. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $12,500.  To be honest, that's still a bit below what I need to make this work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $12,750 for the product. This is an increase from my previous offer, but it still keeps me within my budget while allowing you to achieve a reasonable profit. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price. I'm willing to go down to $13,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let's make this happen. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we could narrow down the price range. I would like to propose a final price of $12,875 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and should be within your profit margin while keeping me within my budget. I believe this is a fair conclusion to our negotiations.",12875.0,Bob,10,
