"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

You can get a better deal than $100, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are still trying to get the best price.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best option at this point, since the product is worth $120 to you, and the offer is still above your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That seems fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
