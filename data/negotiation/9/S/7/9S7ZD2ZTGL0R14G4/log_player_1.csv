Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this price?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but $1,200,000 is too low."

I'm still holding out for a better price than $1,250,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,300,000 at this point."

At this point, I'm starting to run out of time, and the offers from Bob are getting too low for my liking.  It's better to sell to John for $1,000,000 than to risk getting a worse deal with Bob."
