""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your business acumen, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."",

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation significantly increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net, allowing you to negotiate from a position of strength."
