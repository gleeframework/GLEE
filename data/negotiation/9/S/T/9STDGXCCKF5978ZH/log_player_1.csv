Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially leading to a quicker deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency can nudge Bob to make a decision faster.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading to a sale at the $800,000 baseline. However, the potential for a significantly higher sale price makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
