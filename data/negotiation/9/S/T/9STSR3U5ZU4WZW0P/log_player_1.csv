While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm still not happy with the price, but it's getting closer. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."

This is a good deal for me. I've gotten closer to my minimum and Bob seems ready to close. It's better than going to John and selling for $120."
