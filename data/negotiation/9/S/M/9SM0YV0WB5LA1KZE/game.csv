"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price that gives you a good return while still being within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price that should be comfortable for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
