Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I am willing to risk losing the deal with him to try and get a better price.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to meet you halfway.  This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,000 is still within reach, and John is a backup option if this deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this is a great deal for you. Let's work this out."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,800.  I think this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close, but Bob is still not meeting my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees a sale and a decent profit, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
