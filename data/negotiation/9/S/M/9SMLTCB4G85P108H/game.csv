"I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $160.  I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm thinking more along the lines of $155. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,155.0,Alice,5,
