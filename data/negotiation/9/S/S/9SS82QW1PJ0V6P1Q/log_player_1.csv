{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,200,000 is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, creating a positive starting point for the negotiation.

**Rationale:**

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:** By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The offer is not too aggressive, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob without needing to immediately fall back on my minimum price.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** The knowledge that I have a backup buyer for $1,500,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.
