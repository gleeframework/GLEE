"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best first move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It's important to show Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal, but not so low that she'll immediately reject it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and try to push for a price closer to my counteroffer of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
``` 
I'm increasing my offer slightly to $925,000.  This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but still pushing for a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
