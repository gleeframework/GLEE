"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the door for a counter-offer."
