Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, meaning he won't pay more. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you an advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since Bob's maximum valuation is $800,000, you need to leave him some room for a ""win.""

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $875,000."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Subtly implies high demand by suggesting others might be interested.
* **Value-Based Language:** Focuses on the product's benefits instead of just the price.
* **High but Negotiable:** The $75,000 markup provides a cushion for negotiation.  You can always come down a bit if Bob hesitates, but starting high gives you room to work with.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even lower (but not below $800,000).
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive approach might be better.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
