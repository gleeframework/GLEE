"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for and it would be worth a significant amount to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its true value, and it gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is a decent one, but there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and buying from John guarantees that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her $8,000 valuation."
