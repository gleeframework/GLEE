"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get closer to the $100 mark.  I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $95. This is a compromise, but still closer to my initial offer and leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
