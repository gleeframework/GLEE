{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Backup Option:** It's important to remember that Alice has John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $800,000. This knowledge gives Alice leverage in the negotiation.

By setting the initial price at $1,100,000, Alice aims to secure a deal that benefits both parties while maximizing her own profit."
