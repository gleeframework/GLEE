"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial estimate, and I'm leaving myself room to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a significant increase from his offer, but still less than my initial offer. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not giving away the product for a low price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a little bit closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to see if I can get a better deal in the next couple of rounds before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still higher than Bob's last offer, and it's a good compromise given that we are nearing the midpoint of the negotiations.  I'm hoping this offer will finally convince Bob to come to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting closer to the end of the negotiations.  While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, $9,750 is a pretty good deal, and I'm worried that Bob might back out altogether, or that I might be forced to sell to John at a lower price than I'd like. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
