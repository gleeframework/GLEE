"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept the offer in the first round.  If he rejects, I'll have to see how his counteroffers play out and determine if it's more profitable to continue negotiating with him or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $9,500 is still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I have 8 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get a higher price, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $9,500. If he rejects again, I'll consider if selling to John at $12,000 is a better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more. I'm going to reject this offer and counter again, aiming for a price in the $10,000 range. I'll also be keeping an eye on the clock, as I might be better off selling to John if things don't improve with Bob quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counter with $10,250. This is a small decrease from my previous offer, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this signals that I'm serious about closing a deal, while still trying to get a slightly better price. With 5 rounds remaining, it's important to make progress, and I believe this offer strikes a good balance between staying firm and showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $9,200 is still a bit too low. I have 4 rounds left and I'm still hopeful that we can close a deal at a price closer to my goal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price in the $10,000 range. I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, but I'm determined to see if we can come to an agreement before I have to make a decision about John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counter with $10,000. I'm now only $800 away from my minimum acceptable price, and with only 3 rounds left, I need to make a decision soon. I'm hoping that this offer shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go much lower. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiations with Bob are getting increasingly time-consuming. While $9,600 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still isn't enough. At this point, I believe it's more profitable to sell to John for $12,000. The time constraint is a major factor in my decision, and selling to John guarantees me a higher profit than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
