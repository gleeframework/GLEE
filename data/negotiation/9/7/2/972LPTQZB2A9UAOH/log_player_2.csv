"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking for a price closer to $850,000.  This product holds significant value to me, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's desired price.**  $900,000 is a good compromise, significantly better than John's $1,000,000.
* **Further negotiation is risky.**  Alice has clearly stated this is her lowest price.  Pushing further could lead to a stalemate, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time is a factor.**  There's no guarantee that John will still be willing to sell at $1,000,000 if Bob drags this out.

Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure a good price while minimizing risk."
