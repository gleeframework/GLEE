"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to budge any further, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I think $13500 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $13750. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,9,
