Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is not so high that it automatically gets rejected, allowing for a back-and-forth.
* **Having a backup:** I'm aware of John's offer, which acts as a safety net in case Bob doesn't accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** While I can't accept Bob's offer, rejecting it allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is too far below what it's worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $11,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm still open to further discussion.
* **Maintaining minimum price:** $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for future business:** Accepting Bob's offer could potentially open doors for future business opportunities with him.
* **Time efficiency:** Negotiating further might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better price.

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical choice in this situation, balancing profit with time and potential future relationships."
