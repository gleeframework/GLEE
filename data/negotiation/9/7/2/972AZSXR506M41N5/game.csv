"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm prepared to offer $9500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $11000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $10500 for the product.  This price would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a new price of $11250. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
