Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm offering it to you first.  I'm asking $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $15,000 is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value, potentially piquing Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The question ""What do you think?"" allows for an open dialogue and makes it clear I'm open to counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $12,000 is still a decent profit, Bob's initial rejection and counteroffer suggest he's willing to pay more than $10,000 (which is John's offer).
* **Negotiation Room:**  I can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling my intention to continue negotiating. This keeps the pressure on Bob and might encourage him to increase his offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its unique value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:** I'm lowering my price from $15,000 to $13,500, showing flexibility. However, I'm not dropping too low, ensuring a good profit margin. 
* **Focus on Value Again:** I reiterate the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question ""Let me know what you think"" encourages a response and keeps the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. It allows for further negotiation while maintaining a comfortable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While $11,500 is close to John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price of $15,000 and my last counteroffer of $13,500. There's potential for Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Negotiation Remains Open:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation process active and allows me to explore if I can get a better price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. I can make a counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to $13,000.  If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll need to carefully consider my options, weighing the potential of a higher price against the risk of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as possible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This gives us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my last counteroffer of $13,500 and Bob's offer of $11,500. This demonstrates a willingness to reach an agreement while still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  By suggesting a ""meet in the middle"" approach, I'm subtly implying that further negotiation might be limited, encouraging Bob to consider my final offer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my final attempt to get a price closer to my desired range. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to evaluate whether to sell to John or take the risk of continuing the negotiation, potentially ending up with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $12500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Decreasing Returns:** Bob's offers have been progressively lower, and his latest offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 higher than John's offer. 
* **Risk of Further Decreases:** There's a high chance that further negotiation will result in an even lower price, potentially below John's offer.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation is time-consuming and may not lead to a significantly better outcome.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my expectations. John offers a guaranteed sale at a price that's still above my minimum value."
