I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $725,000, and that's as low as I can go.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and it's a reasonable price. It's better to secure the deal at $725,000 than risk losing it and having to pay John $1,500,000."
