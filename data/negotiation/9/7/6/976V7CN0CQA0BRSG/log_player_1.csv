""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product can bring you significant value exceeding that price. How about we meet in the middle at $890,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $890,000, which would be $870,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000.

Bob is moving closer to my price, but I'm still willing to hold out for a bit more. There's still a significant gap between his offer and John's guaranteed price."

""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  While $870,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a little more. Let's settle this right now - how about $880,000? This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $880,000. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

While I could push for more, $875,000 is a strong price and significantly above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
