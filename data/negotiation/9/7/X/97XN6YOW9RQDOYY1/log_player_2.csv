(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is significantly higher than your value.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum price point, $100.  Since I'm willing to buy from John for that price, there's no reason to go higher.  This also establishes a clear boundary for negotiations and lets Alice know I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum value. I'm committed to getting the best deal possible, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $120, which is halfway between my maximum value ($100) and Alice's last offer ($160). This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I won't settle for a price too far above my limit. It also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is closer to my maximum value, it's still too high. I'm committed to getting a better deal if possible, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to buy from John for $100 if we can't reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $130, which is a slight increase from my previous offer but still within a reasonable range. This shows that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but I'm also not willing to overpay.  We're getting close to a possible agreement, and I want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is only $35 above my maximum value of $100. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it rather than risk losing the deal or ending up with a worse price. It's also getting late in the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
