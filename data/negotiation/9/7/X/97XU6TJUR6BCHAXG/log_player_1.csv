{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm asking $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my ideal price and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from him.  It's worth accepting and getting the deal done."
