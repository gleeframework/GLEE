Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider a price of $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see value in the product, but $1,100,000 is a significant step down from its true worth.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose an even lower price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that reflects the product's worth to me. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the minimum amount I'm willing to accept."
