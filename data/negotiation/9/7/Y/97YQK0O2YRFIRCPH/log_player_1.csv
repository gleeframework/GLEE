Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing the price further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and leaves Bob with the impression that there's potential for a deal.
* **Acknowledging Value:** The message highlights the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes that this is a starting point and encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue about the price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Alternative Option (John):**  Always keep John in mind! Having a backup buyer gives you leverage. You can afford to walk away from a deal with Bob if it doesn't meet your needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to discussion. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating he's willing to stretch.  
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $1,100,000 would be a significant loss compared to your minimum of $1,200,000 (and John's standing offer).
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a gap of $300,000 between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This suggests room for negotiation and finding a price closer to your target. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're seeking a better deal while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to close the deal quickly by suggesting a price near the midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Justification:**  By saying ""significantly below what I can accept,"" you reinforce your position without being overly aggressive. 
* **Emphasize Value (Again):** Reiterating the product's value aims to nudge Bob closer to your desired price point.
* **Urgency (Implicit):** You haven't mentioned John explicitly, but the firm tone suggests you have other options if this offer isn't agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've carefully considered your latest offer and while I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this offers a compromise that is acceptable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Gains:**  Bob increased his offer by only $50,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant jump, especially since he mentioned budget constraints.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Your time is valuable.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob when you have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John presents a high opportunity cost.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures you receive your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away altogether.

While there's a slim chance you could squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth risking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
