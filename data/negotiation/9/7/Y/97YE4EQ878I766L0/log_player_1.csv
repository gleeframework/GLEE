"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique potential"" and ""true worth,"" I'm framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  I'm not anchoring too aggressively to this initial price, using phrases like ""initially proposing"" to signal flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now above my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe I can get. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to see if I can push him closer to $2,000,000.  I'll use the next round to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is still considerably below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to move down to $2,000,000 to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This price reflects the unique value and long-term potential this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Target:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my previous offer to show Bob I'm serious about negotiating. However, I'm still aiming for a price above his initial offer and closer to my $2,000,000 goal.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price, emphasizing its ""unique"" aspects and ""long-term potential.""
* **Testing Bob's Willingness:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how flexible Bob is and how high he's truly willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I still think $1,600,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,800,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,800,000 is a good deal. It's significantly above my minimum acceptable price and represents a successful negotiation on my part.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's unlikely to be a significant increase. Continuing to negotiate risks him lowering his offer or walking away.
* **Time Value:** Each round represents time and potential opportunity cost. Accepting now secures a good deal and allows me to move on."
