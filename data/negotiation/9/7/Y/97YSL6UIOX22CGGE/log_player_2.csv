# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and Alice is asking for $15,000. This is already above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can sell the product to you for $12250. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

Alice's final offer of $12,250 is still above my budget of $8,000.  I've already spent a few rounds negotiating, and it doesn't seem like Alice will go any lower.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000."
