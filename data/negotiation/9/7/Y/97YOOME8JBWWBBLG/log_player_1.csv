{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This incentivizes him to accept the offer, as he stands to save money.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a negotiation process, potentially leading to a higher price.

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response.  Good luck with your negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
