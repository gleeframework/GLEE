Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However,  I want to make this deal happen.  I'm offering a final compromise of $1,300,000.  This price represents a significant investment for you,  and I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,300,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's risky to assume she'll drop to a price close enough to your $800,000 limit.  Buying from John guarantees the best price and avoids the risk of missing out altogether."
