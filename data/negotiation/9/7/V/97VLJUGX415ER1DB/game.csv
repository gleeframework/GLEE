"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product's value to me is lower than its value to you, and I'd like to negotiate a price that's more in line with that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, reflecting a compromise on both sides. This price still leaves me a profit, and it's closer to a mutually agreeable point.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a price of $950,000 would be more reasonable. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a final price of $1,000,000. This price represents a fair compromise, allowing you to acquire the product within your budget while still offering me a reasonable return.  I believe this is the best offer we can reach, so let's close the deal. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
