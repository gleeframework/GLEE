"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. Could you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $600,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is my final compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
