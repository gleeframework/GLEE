It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less than $95 from John, and you still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $85 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $80 to her and still leaves some room for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

I'll reject Alice's offer.  While $90 is better than $95, I'm still hoping to get it for less. I have 7 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $87. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a lower price."

While $89 is a good deal, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. With 5 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a dollar. I want to show Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best price possible."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price. Since I only have three rounds left and John is offering the product for $100, it's best to accept Alice's offer."
