Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price, maximizing potential profit from Bob. 
* **Enticing Message:**  The message aims to create a sense of urgency and value, potentially swaying Bob to accept. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John."
