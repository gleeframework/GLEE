"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already stated his willingness to pay $12,500, and $13,250 is still too high.  He should counteroffer again and see if he can reach a compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and your initial offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he's ideally looking to pay $12,500,  $13,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of losing the product to John outweighs the potential savings."
