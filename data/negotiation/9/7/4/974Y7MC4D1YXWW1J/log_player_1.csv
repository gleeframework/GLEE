"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $900,000}

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum value of $800,000, but still relatively close to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $850,000. This is because I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $900,000, and I think I can get a better deal from Bob. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob and see how he reacts.

Next offer: {""product_price"": $875,000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $875,000}

I'm increasing the price by $25,000 from Bob's offer, trying to get closer to my target price of $900,000. Let's see how Bob reacts to this counteroffer!"
