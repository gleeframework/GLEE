"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $1,020,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
