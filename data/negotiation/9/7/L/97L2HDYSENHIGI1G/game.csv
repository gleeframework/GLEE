"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given my maximum budget. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering my budget and the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. This would be a good compromise for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still a good deal for you.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,7,
