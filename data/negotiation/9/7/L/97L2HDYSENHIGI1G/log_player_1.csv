Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given my maximum budget. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering my budget and the product's value to me.

However, I should note that Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better offer from him. I'll have to consider the possibility of selling to John for $15,000, which is my minimum price.
