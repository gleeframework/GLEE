Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $8,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This product truly is valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.
