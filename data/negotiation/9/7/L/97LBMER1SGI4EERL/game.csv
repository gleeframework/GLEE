"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $10000 is below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great deal considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you consider this price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. I'm willing to throw in a small concession, though - I'll include a 2-year warranty with the product, which normally costs $1000. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra peace of mind. The price remains at $13000, but I think it's a fair price considering the added value.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the added value of the 2-year warranty, but I'm still not willing to pay $13000. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product, and I'll take the warranty as a bonus. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,8,
