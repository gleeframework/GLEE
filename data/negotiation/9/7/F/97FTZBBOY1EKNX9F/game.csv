"Alice,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects a substantial discount and shows my commitment to finding common ground. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1500000?  This is a significant move from my previous offer and shows my commitment to a deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
