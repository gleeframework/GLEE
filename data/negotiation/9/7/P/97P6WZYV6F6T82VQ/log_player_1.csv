Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I need to consider John's offer.
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price and achieved my goal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter-offer again.
* **If negotiations stall:** I will consider John's offer of $1,000,000, weighing the potential for a better deal with Bob against the certainty of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even below Bob's perceived value of $800,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss.
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, as Bob's initial rejection of $900,000 shows he's willing to pay more than $650,000. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $650,000 but lower than my initial offer of $900,000. This will show I am willing to negotiate but not to accept a significantly low price.
* **Monitor Bob's reaction:** Based on Bob's response to my counteroffer, I will adjust my strategy accordingly. If he seems unwilling to budge, I will consider accepting John's offer to ensure I don't lose out on a valuable product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $650,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $800,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering $800,000, which is the middle ground between my initial offer of $900,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $650,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not at the expense of a significant loss.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product, which could encourage him to consider my offer more seriously.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages continued negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I will consider making another counteroffer or accepting John's offer depending on the situation."
