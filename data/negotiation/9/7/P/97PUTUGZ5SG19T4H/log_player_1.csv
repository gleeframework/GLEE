Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it will be a profitable investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still a significant drop from my asking price and below the value I know the product holds. I have 9 rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, or sell to John for $800,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still leaves room for your profit, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $850,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  I'm confident this price allows for both of us to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a little more, $825,000 is a good price considering the time we've spent negotiating.  It's also above the value I'd get from selling to John, and I'd rather close the deal now and move on."
