"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it will be a profitable investment. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still leaves room for your profit, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $850,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  I'm confident this price allows for both of us to make a reasonable profit.",825000.0,Bob,4,
