"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm starting with a price of $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some wiggle room for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation shows good faith and encourages Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Enthusiasm:** Expressing that I think Bob will like the product can make him more interested in buying it. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $120 is still above my minimum price of $100, but I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing appreciation for his interest, which builds a positive tone.
* **Counter with a Reason:** Instead of simply rejecting, I provide a reason for my counteroffer: I'm aiming for a higher price. 
* **Offer Compromise:** I propose a price of $135, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution. 
* **Encourages Continued Negotiation:** The message suggests that I'm still open to further negotiation, keeping the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Can you consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is closer to my desired price range and still above my minimum. Given that we are already in round 4, I'm choosing to accept his offer to secure a sale. There's a chance that I might get a slightly higher offer later, but risking further negotiation could lead to a lower price or even losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer now guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of a potential loss."
