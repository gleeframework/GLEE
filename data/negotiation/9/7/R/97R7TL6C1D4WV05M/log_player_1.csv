"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming for the best possible price, but also aware that John is a backup option at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price higher than what John is offering.  I think this is a fair compromise and might be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is a good deal. It's more than my minimum of $100 and getting closer to my initial asking price.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and ensure a sale."
