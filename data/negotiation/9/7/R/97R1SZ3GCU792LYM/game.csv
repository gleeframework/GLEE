"Alice, your product is very interesting, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
