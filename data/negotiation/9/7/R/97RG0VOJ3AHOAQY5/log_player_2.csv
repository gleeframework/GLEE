"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $100, but Alice's offer is $90. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup option.**  Knowing you can buy from John for $100 gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $87.50. It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.** You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering $87.50. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might not be worth it.** It's possible you could get a slightly lower price, but the risk is that Alice might reject your counteroffer, forcing you to either buy from John or walk away with nothing. 
* **The risk is outweighed by the potential savings.** Saving $2.50 is a good outcome, and it's likely you won't get a much better deal with further negotiation."
