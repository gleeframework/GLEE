"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000.
* Alice's offer is $950,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, there's room for negotiation as the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still gives her a profit of $50,000. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further bargaining if needed.
*  It's also strategically advantageous as it sets the tone for the negotiation by demonstrating that you are serious about finding a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is closer to her initial offer than your counteroffer.
* While it's still within your budget, there's still room for negotiation. 
* You can likely get the price down further by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer closer to your previous $850,000 proposal.
* You're also still closer to your desired price than what John is offering, so the risk of losing the deal is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and your previous offer. 
* It demonstrates your willingness to meet her halfway while still securing a better price than her last proposal.
* It's a good tactic to move the negotiation closer to a potential agreement.  If Alice rejects, you can decide whether to make another counteroffer or choose John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to her initial price, and there's a chance she won't budge further.
* The negotiation is starting to feel like it's going in circles, and you're not making significant progress towards your ideal price.
* While you're still willing to pay less than $1,000,000, you're running the risk of Alice rejecting your next offer, which could lead to more back-and-forth negotiation and potentially losing the deal.
* Buying from John guarantees you get the product for $1,000,000, ensuring you won't lose the opportunity altogether. While it's not the ideal price, it avoids further delays and potential for a failed negotiation."
