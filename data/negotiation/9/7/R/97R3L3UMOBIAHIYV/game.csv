"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I believe my initial offer was already quite competitive. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000, which I feel represents a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $975,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000 for the product. This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe it's a fair price for the product's value to me.",980000.0,Bob,6,
