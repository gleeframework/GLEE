Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $130. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a good profit while being closer to his offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125.  Although it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and higher than selling to John.  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it's also risky as Bob might walk away."
