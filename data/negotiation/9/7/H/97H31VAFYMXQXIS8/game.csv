"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This product is worth $12,000 to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",10900.0,Alice,5,
