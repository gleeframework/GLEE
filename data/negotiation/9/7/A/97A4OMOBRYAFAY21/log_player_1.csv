{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to lower the price if necessary, while still ensuring a profit above your minimum.
* **It's a strong opening:** This sets a firm price and makes it clear you're not going to give it away. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be ready to counter-offer or go with John, depending on his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer with a slightly lower price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price without losing the deal altogether."

Bob is sticking to his $9,000 offer, and it's clear that we're not going to get closer to my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While it's not the ideal price, it's still a decent profit and ensures I don't waste any more time with Bob."
