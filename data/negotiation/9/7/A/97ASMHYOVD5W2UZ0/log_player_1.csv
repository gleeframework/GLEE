{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $18,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down. Even if he negotiates, you're likely to land on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A higher initial price can sometimes create a perception of higher value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Value:**  While not stated, understanding the general market value of the product is crucial. If $18,000 is significantly higher than the market rate, Bob might reject it outright.
* **Bob's Perspective:**  This strategy assumes some degree of value for Bob beyond the $12,000.  Maybe it's convenience, scarcity, or other factors not explicitly stated.

This offer aims to strike a balance between ambition and the potential to secure a deal with Bob."
