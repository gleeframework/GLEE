Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $16,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth in the current market. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:**  While a direct jump to $16,000 might seem steep,  mentioning ""value"" and ""current market"" provides a reason for the price, even if slightly vague.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give Alice valuable information. If he flat-out rejects it, she knows he's likely very price-sensitive. If he counters, she can negotiate from there.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Alice could also try:

* **A slightly lower price:**  Perhaps start at $14,000 to appear more reasonable.
* **A more detailed explanation of value:** If the product has specific features that justify the higher price to Bob, highlighting those could make the offer more appealing."
