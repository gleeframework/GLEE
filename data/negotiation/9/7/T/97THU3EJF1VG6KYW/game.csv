"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $950000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offer. How about $1025000? This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my target. Let's come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too far off from my target. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to meet in the middle, but $975000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1000000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
