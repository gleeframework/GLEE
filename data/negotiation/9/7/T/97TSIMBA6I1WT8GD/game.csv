"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the potential this product holds. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, given the potential for future negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to further discussion.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident the value this product holds justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $1350000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the potential of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  I believe this is a fair price considering our previous discussions. If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll need to seriously consider my other options.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
