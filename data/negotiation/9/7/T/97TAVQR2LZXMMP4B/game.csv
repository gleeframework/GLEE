"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be happy to pay $9000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10500. Would you be willing to go down to $9800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10200. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10200. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9600?",9600.0,Bob,6,
