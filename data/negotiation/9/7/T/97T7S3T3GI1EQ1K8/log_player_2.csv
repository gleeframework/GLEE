"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  $9,500 is still a bit high for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob is trying to be aggressive but fair.  He's offering $8,500, which is $500 more than Alice's bottom line.  This shows he's serious about buying, but also that he's willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice, reminding her that Bob is willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

Bob is again trying to meet Alice halfway, offering a price that is $250 higher than his initial counteroffer and $250 lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows good faith while still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and Bob is close to his ideal price. Accepting the offer is the best option in this round.  While Bob might be able to squeeze out another $100 or so, the risk of losing the deal to John or continuing a drawn-out negotiation is not worth it."
