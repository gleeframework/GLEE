"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
