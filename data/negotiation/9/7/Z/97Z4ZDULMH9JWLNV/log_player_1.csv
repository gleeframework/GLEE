Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $14,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
