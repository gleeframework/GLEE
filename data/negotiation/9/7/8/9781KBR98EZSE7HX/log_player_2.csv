"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to pay as little as possible and $115 is still higher than your maximum of $120. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* The price of $105 is still within my budget and is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  $110 is still too high for my budget. While it's closer to my maximum of $120, there's still room for negotiation.
*  I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further. There are still multiple rounds left, so it's worth trying to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm raising my counteroffer slightly from $105 to $108. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise.
*  It's still a price that's within my budget and a reasonable compromise, considering Alice's previous offer of $110.
*  Hopefully, this will be close enough to Alice's desired price that she'll accept it, but still saves me some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has remained firm at $110.  
* I've already counteroffered twice and am approaching my maximum budget. 
* Accepting the offer at $110 is the best option. It's still a good deal compared to buying from John at $120, and it avoids further negotiation rounds."
