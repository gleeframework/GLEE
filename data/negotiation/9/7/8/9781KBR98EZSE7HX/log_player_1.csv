I'm starting with a price of $115.  This gives Bob a decent discount while still leaving me a profit margin. I want to see if he's willing to negotiate from this point."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $105, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm countering with $110. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer but still gives Bob a good deal while allowing me to make a decent profit. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and get us closer to a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to stick with my previous counteroffer of $110.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will finally come around to it."
