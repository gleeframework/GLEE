"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm sure this product is great, but I'm only able to offer $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $117. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $117. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",117.0,Alice,5,
