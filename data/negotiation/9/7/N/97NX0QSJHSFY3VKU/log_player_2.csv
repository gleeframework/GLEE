"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Would you like to make an offer on the product for $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is substantially lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. It leaves room to gradually increase your offer while still staying well below your $10,000 maximum.
* **Gauging Alice's Response:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. Her response will give you valuable information for the rest of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $12,000 is still above your budget. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and John's offer of $10,000 acts as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $10,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Your Limit:** This offer represents your maximum budget. It's unlikely you'll find a better deal with Alice.
* **Fair Compromise:**  By suggesting a price directly in the middle of your previous offers, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **John's Offer:** You can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if Alice completely rejects this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. That's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:**  Alice has made it clear that $12,500 is her absolute lowest price. She's unlikely to budge further.
* **Budget Limit:** You've already reached your maximum budget of $10,000.  
* **John's Guarantee:**  Why risk further negotiation when John offers the product at your desired price? It's time to take the guaranteed deal."
