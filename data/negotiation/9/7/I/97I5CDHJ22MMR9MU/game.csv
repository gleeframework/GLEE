"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm asking for $1,400,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $1,250,000 undervalues it.  Would you consider $1,350,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
