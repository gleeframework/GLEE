Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  A good strategy is to:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below Bob's maximum valuation.
2. **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  Expect some back and forth. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confidently stating your price close to Bob's maximum.
* **Justification:** ""Value and potential"" vaguely imply the reasons for the price without revealing your hand.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though it's just John) adds a time pressure element.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Your willingness to negotiate slightly downward will depend on how much risk you're willing to take to potentially secure a higher sale."
