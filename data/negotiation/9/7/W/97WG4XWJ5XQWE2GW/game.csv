"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a reasonable profit. Can you consider this counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $10,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
