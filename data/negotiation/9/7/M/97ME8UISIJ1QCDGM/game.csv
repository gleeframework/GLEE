"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we consider $1,300,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's make this simple: $1,250,000, and we have a deal. This is a final offer, reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
