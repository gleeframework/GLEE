"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though I haven't specified what the product is. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I want to appear flexible and willing to work with Bob.  This approach encourages him to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, and far below my minimum. Accepting would be a significant loss. I have ample room to negotiate and time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we consider $1,300,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Not Really):** By saying ""meet halfway,"" I'm making a psychological move to appear more flexible than I am.  The actual middle ground would be $1,300,000, but framing it this way might make Bob more receptive.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my position above Bob's offer. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:** This offer leaves me room to negotiate further while staying comfortably above my $1,200,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but Not Enough:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which is a good sign. However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiating Leverage:** I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation. I have John's offer as a safety net, and I believe Bob might be willing to go higher.
* **Time Consideration:** With six rounds remaining, I have some time to explore if Bob will move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's make this simple: $1,250,000, and we have a deal. This is a final offer, reflecting the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm drawing a line in the sand with a ""final offer"" while still leaving room for a small profit above my minimum. This conveys seriousness and urgency.
* **Simplified Offer:** By removing the back-and-forth and providing a clean number, I'm making it easier for Bob to agree. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the ""true value"" to subtly remind Bob he's getting a good deal, even at this price. 
* **Time Pressure:** While I haven't explicitly stated a deadline, mentioning ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency."
