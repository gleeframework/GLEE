"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the potential value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,300,000 represents the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price point reflects a more agreeable middle ground.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,
