# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe holds significant potential for your company.  While I can't disclose the exact details of the product at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm certain you'll find the product to be a valuable asset.  Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Alice is selling for $1,000,000, while John is selling for $1,500,000.
* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You're willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is lower than that.

Even though you don't know the exact value of the product, it's a good idea to take advantage of a lower price from a reliable seller like Alice."
