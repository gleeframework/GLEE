Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $10,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle at $11,250? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

Alice is very consistently trying to meet in the middle.  At this point, further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better price and there's a risk Alice will stop negotiating. Accepting the $11,250 offer secures a good deal."
