"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product offers.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $10,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle at $11,250? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
