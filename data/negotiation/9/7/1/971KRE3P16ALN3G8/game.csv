"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",80.0,Bob,4,
