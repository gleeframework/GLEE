"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

This product is way over your budget. You'll need to counteroffer to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 for it right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$140 is still too much. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 80}
