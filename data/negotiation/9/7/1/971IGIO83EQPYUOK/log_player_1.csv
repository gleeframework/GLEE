"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant mark-up from my minimum, but it allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to walk away if his counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$4,000 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000, but this is getting very close to my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm still not desperate. If he rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are still very low, and I'm getting close to my minimum. I'm not confident that I can get a better deal with Bob, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This is a secure deal that guarantees me a reasonable profit."
