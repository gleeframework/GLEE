"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. $13,500 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $11,500? That's the absolute highest I can go.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
