"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount from the original price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway from your original offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value.",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
