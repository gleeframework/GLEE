{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price.  It also shows that I'm open to discussing a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $8,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $7,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it.  This allows me to make a profit without risking a further negotiation that could potentially result in a lower offer."
