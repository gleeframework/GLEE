{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my target.  I also want to emphasize that I am open to negotiation to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $75 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer at $85, which is still above my minimum but closer to his offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully leads to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still not convinced that $85 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82.50 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's also a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  I'm going to accept his offer."
