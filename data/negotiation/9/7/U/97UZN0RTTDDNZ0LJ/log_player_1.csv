Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its true worth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high. 
* **Testing the waters:** By offering the product at $1,500,000, you're gauging Bob's eagerness and potentially his perceived value.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then decide if it's more beneficial to secure a deal with Bob or move to John. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have limited information about Bob's willingness to pay beyond the $1,000,000 baseline."
