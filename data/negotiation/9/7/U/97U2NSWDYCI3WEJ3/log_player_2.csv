"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's always a good strategy to try to negotiate a lower price, especially since there's an alternative seller (John) who is willing to sell for a price that's within Bob's budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,050,000?  This would still allow me to gain some profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still more expensive than buying from John. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better price by making another counteroffer."
