"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,050,000?  This would still allow me to gain some profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
