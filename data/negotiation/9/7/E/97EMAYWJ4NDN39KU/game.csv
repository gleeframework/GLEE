"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer, but $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $20,000. So, the total value is now $870,000. Is this a deal you can accept?",870000.0,Alice,5,
