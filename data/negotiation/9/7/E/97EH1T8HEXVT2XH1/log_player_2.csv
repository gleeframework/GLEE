"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  I understand it's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This represents a significant savings for you, while still allowing me a healthy profit. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
