Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation downward, while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and demand to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might outright reject this high offer. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially gain an extra $4,000. If Bob rejects it, you still have your guaranteed sale to John."
