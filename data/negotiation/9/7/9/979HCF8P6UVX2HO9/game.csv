"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it will be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value our potential partnership, I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant concession given the product's value. This price reflects a compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm thinking of $980,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable given the product's value to me.",980000.0,Bob,4,
