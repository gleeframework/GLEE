Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Value Extraction:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so starting with a price slightly below that ($14,000) aims to capture the maximum possible profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring Alice earns significantly more than her minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing that John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out completely. This allows for a more ambitious initial offer to Bob."
