"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **You can get a better deal from John:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure the product for $1,000,000 from John, which is your maximum limit."
