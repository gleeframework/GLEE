Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $80 for this product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price of $120. John provides a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum. It makes more financial sense to sell to John at this point."
