"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant value for you.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still unable to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
