"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,5,
