"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
