"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me room to drop the price if needed.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but if he's not, I'm prepared to counter his offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price through negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for something closer to my initial asking price. I believe $12,000 is a fair compromise, given that Bob's offer was significantly lower than my initial offer."
