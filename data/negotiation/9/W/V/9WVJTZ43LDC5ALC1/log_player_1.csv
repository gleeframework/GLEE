Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the minimum price I'm willing to accept. There's no room for negotiation to earn more. Since John is offering the same price, it makes sense to sell to John and avoid further back and forth with Bob."
