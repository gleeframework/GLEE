{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $12,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $13,500, and it's closer to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. This offer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $13,000 is only $500 more than Bob's maximum budget and $500 less than her previous offer.  It's a good compromise, especially since Bob is unsure if he can get a lower price from Alice. Accepting this offer saves Bob time and effort compared to continuing to negotiate."
