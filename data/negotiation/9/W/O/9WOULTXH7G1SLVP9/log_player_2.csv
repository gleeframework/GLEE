"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* It's also significantly higher than what Alice values the product at ($1,200,000). 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as there's room for both of you to find a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
*  While she's shown some flexibility,  I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price. There's still room for us to meet in the middle without sacrificing too much. 
* I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if she's willing to compromise further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product has great value, and I'm still interested. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions, and it allows us to both reach a reasonable agreement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $1,390,000 is still a bit too high for me. 
* I believe we can find a middle ground closer to my last offer of $1,375,000.
* I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer, hopefully finding a mutually agreeable price."
