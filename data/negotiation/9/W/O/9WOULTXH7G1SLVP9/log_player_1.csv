Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
