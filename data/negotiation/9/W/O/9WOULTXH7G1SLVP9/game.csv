"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product has great value, and I'm still interested. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions, and it allows us to both reach a reasonable agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
