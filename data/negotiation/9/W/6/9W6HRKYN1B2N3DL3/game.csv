"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise and reflects the value I see in the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
