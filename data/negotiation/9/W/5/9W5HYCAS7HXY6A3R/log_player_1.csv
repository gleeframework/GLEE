"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still a bit below my minimum. This creates some room for negotiation and shows that I'm open to a deal, but I'm also valuing the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to accept. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a higher price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and might get Bob closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price and want to see if I can push Bob further. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm also aware that we are running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds and Bob is not getting any closer to my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer from Bob or running out of time."
