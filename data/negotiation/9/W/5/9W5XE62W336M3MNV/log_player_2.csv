"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting Alice's offer.  $1,000,000 is far above your budget, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John for a much lower price. There's no reason to accept at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, reflecting your willingness to negotiate but also your firm budget.  Starting at $600,000 establishes a clear negotiating range and encourages Alice to consider a deal closer to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your budget, and you have a viable alternative with John for $800,000.  It's better to continue negotiating, trying to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

This counteroffer continues to show you're serious about buying from Alice but are unwilling to go above your budget.  $700,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing you're willing to meet her halfway, but still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
