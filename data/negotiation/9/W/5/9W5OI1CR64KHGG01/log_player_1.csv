Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's likely to counteroffer, but you've given yourself some space to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  The price is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him, making it a good deal from his perspective.

This strategy allows you to start strong while leaving room for potential counteroffers and a good chance of reaching a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is still a profit for you, it's significantly lower than your initial offer of $12,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price. You're in a good position because you have John as a backup buyer, so you're not pressured to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows you're willing to compromise and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing value:** You're still reminding Bob that he's getting a great deal, even at $11,000.
* **Staying above your minimum:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000. 

This counteroffer strikes a balance between getting a good price and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 isn't the ideal price, it's still a good profit for you, and it's closer to your minimum.  It's also likely that further negotiation with Bob will not get you much higher. 

Here's why accepting Bob's offer makes sense:

* **Profitable:**  You're still earning a decent profit of $2,500 above your minimum. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee you'll get a significantly better price.
* **Potential for future deals:**  By closing this deal, you might establish a good relationship with Bob, leading to potential future sales where you could potentially get a higher price. 

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer balances your desire for a higher price with the practicality of making a sale and maximizing your profit."
