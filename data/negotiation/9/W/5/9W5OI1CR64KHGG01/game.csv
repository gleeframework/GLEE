"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
