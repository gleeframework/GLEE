"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a real game-changer, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your company. My asking price is $1200000, which reflects the product's high quality and potential.  I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value of this product,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  While $1000000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1100000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm prepared to offer $1050000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. Given the unique value and potential of this product, I'm prepared to come down to $1075000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, but I'm confident that this deal will be mutually beneficial.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
