"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,500. That's a good step, but I still need to make a little more to make this work for me. How about we settle on $8,500? That's a good middle ground, and it's a fair price for the value the product will bring you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
