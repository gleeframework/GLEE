Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some leverage.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not going too high, as this would make it harder for Bob to accept. I want to be open to negotiation and find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Alternative buyer:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I know I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me more confidence in holding firm on my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and well below my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting this would be a major loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** Even though Bob rejected my first offer, he's still interested in the product. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer:**  I have a secure alternative with John's offer of $15,000, giving me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and try for a better price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to find a compromise that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility. A $9,000 price is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's initial counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Focusing on a solution:** I'm framing the negotiation as a collaborative effort to find a solution that works for both of us. This can help create a more positive atmosphere and increase the chances of reaching an agreement.

By offering $9,000, I'm testing the waters and seeing how receptive Bob is to a higher price. I'm still confident in my ability to sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, indicating that there's still room for improvement in the price.
* **John's offer:**  As a reminder, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. This gives me the security to hold out for a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate with Bob.  I'm confident that I can push for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,500. That's a good step, but I still need to make a little more to make this work for me. How about we settle on $8,500? That's a good middle ground, and it's a fair price for the value the product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm again offering a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's latest offer ($7,500). This shows continued flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, particularly how it benefits him.
* **Setting a reasonable final price:** I believe $8,500 is a fair compromise, close to my minimum acceptable price and within a range Bob might be willing to accept. 
* **Confidence in John's offer:**  While $8,500 is below my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. Knowing I have John's offer provides the confidence to push for a price closer to my target.

This counteroffer aims to close the gap and potentially lead to a mutually agreeable final price."
