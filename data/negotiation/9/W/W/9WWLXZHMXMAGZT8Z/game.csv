"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for a price significantly lower than what it's worth to you. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this deal beneficial.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110 again.  We're close to a deal, let's make this happen! ",110.0,Alice,5,
