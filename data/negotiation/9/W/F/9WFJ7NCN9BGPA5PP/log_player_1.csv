"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price,  $1,200,000, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets a high bar and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident he won't accept this first offer, but it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'll reject and counter offer to try and close the deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still a fair price considering my minimum value. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000.  We're getting close to my minimum value and this is a significant compromise from my previous offer. I'm hoping this will make Bob realize that we're nearing a point where a deal is more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not yet ready to settle for $975,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,025,000. This is a small reduction from my previous offer and hopefully signals to Bob that we're almost at a point where we can close the deal. I'm hoping he'll realize that further negotiation might lead to him missing out on the opportunity altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value.  I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John, so I'm going to choose option (3) and sell to John for $1,000,000."
