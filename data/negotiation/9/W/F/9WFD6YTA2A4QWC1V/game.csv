"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $120.  This is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can make a deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $135. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $135 is still out of my budget.  I'm confident we can close the deal at $125. This is a fair price that I think is reasonable for both of us.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to meet you at $130. This is the last time I'll be willing to budge, so I hope we can make a deal.",130.0,Alice,7,
