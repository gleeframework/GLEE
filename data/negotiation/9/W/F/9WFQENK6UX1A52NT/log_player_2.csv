# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $100.

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice. You can afford to pay $100, but you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with her."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. This is my best offer.

Alice's offer of $90 is a good deal.  It's lower than John's price and is close to what you're willing to pay. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
