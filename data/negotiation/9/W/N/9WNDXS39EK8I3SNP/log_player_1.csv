Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe you'll find highly beneficial. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that can significantly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  Offering it for the full $1,500,000 might seem too aggressive and could make Bob walk away. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net."
