"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to negotiate. Let's start with a price of $95. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a decent deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the negotiation, but $95 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering your valuation of the product, how about we agree on a price of $90? This is a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a significant discount for us. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is closer to his target, he can still try to push for a lower price.  He might be able to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $88 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate your offer of $88. To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $89 for the product? This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $89 is within Bob's budget of $100.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the difference between $89 and his desired price is small. 
* **Risk:**  There's a risk that if Bob rejects Alice's offer, Alice might not be willing to go lower. He also risks losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John for $100.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision at this point."
