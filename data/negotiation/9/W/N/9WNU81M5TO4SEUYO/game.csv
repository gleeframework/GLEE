"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering your valuation of the product, how about we agree on a price of $90? This is a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a significant discount for us. Let me know if this works for you!",90.0,Alice,3,
