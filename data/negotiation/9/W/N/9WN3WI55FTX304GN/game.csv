"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, as I believe this product's value will far exceed that price for you in the long run. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm not comfortable going as low as $875000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $912500. This still leaves me with a profit, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's work together to make this happen.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $912500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $900000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,6,
