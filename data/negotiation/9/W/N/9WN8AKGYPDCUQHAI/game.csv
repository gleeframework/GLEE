"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to get a fair return on my product.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a good compromise and will ensure we both get a fair deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",900000.0,Alice,5,
