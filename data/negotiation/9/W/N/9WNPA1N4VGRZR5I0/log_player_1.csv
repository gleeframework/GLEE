Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""value"" and ""uniqueness,"" you aim to justify the high price, even if Bob knows the base value is lower. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer gauges Bob's interest and sets the stage for potential counter-offers. You can always lower the price, but you can't raise it once an initial offer is made.

**Important:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, be prepared to negotiate. You can gradually lower your price, aiming for somewhere between $800,000 and $1,200,000,  keeping in mind your guaranteed sale to John."
