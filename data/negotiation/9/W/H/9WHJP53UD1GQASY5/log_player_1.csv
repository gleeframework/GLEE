Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. Let me know your thoughts!  "", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **Above John's price:** $18,000 is higher than John's offer, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Not too high:**  It's not an outrageous price that would immediately scare Bob off. 
* **Open to offers:**  This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counter with his own price. 

By leaving room for negotiation and highlighting the value of the product, I maximize my chances of getting a better price than John's offer."
