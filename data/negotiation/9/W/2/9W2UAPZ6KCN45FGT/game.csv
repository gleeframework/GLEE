"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $12,000 to us, but I understand its worth to you might be around $8,000. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
