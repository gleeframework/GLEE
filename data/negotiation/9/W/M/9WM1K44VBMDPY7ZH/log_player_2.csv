"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if we can get closer to a reasonable price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which might seem aggressive. However, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. We need to push Alice closer to our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice moved down in price, which is a good sign, but $14,000 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating and inch closer to an acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you consider $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

We are increasing our offer but staying firm below $10,000. This shows Alice we are willing to negotiate but also sets a clear limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. $12,000 is my final offer - it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice says $12,000 is her final offer, we still have room to negotiate and we're getting close to the limit.  We'll push a bit further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? That's a very generous offer considering my budget."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

We're pushing a bit over our budget here to signal to Alice that we are serious about the purchase, but also trying to stay below her $12,000. This is a crucial point in the negotiation."
