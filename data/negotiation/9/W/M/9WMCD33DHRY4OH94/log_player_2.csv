"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice is offering the product for $75, which is already a good deal since it's worth $80 to both of you. There's no guarantee you can get a better price through further negotiation, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy it at this price."
