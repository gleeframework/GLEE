"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and $900,000 falls quite short of what I can accept. Would you consider $1,075,000? This feels like a fairer compromise considering its potential worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
