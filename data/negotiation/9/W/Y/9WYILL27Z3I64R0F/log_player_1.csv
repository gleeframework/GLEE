At this point, the negotiations have gone on for a while, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, the risk of continuing negotiations is that Bob might continue to lower his offer, and I might end up with a price lower than my minimum.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
