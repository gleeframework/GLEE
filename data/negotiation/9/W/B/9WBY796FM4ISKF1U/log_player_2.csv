Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
