"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting at this point. Rejecting allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1200000 is a significant offer, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this opportunity.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate further. There's still potential to get a better deal than Alice's current offer, and Bob isn't in a rush to buy from John at the full price."
