"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $1,250,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Please let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You save $250,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Below Your Limit:** The price is well below your $1,500,000 maximum.

While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's a risk she'll sell it to the other interested buyer. Accepting now secures the product at a favorable price."
