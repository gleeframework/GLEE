"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. While I understand your perspective, I am still unable to meet you at $9250. I would like to propose a price of $8800 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our respective positions.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8800. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Can we meet in the middle at $9150?",9150.0,Alice,5,
