,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would still leave a good profit margin for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good margin.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with. Let's close this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
