"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $140. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $140
* **Your value:** $150
* **John's price:** $150

Since Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay and also lower than what John is selling for, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. It saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
