"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you! Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, considering your interest in the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95, which would be $87.50. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $87.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference one more time, and I'll come down to $91.25?  That seems like a fair compromise, don't you think?",91.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $91.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $85. Can we do that?",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a price that works for us. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $89.  This is my final offer, as I'm running out of time. Let me know if you're interested.",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $84. Can we do that?",84.0,Bob,8,
