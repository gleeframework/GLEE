Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer leaves $50,000 on the table for Bob, which is a significant amount but still less than the $200,000 he would gain by accepting the offer at his full valuation.  This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (and me selling to John for $800,000) with the potential of maximizing my profit."
