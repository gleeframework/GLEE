"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more than that, but I'm feeling generous today! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $100, to leave room for negotiation. This gives Bob a chance to bargain, but also establishes a high baseline value in his mind.  I'm also framing it as a ""generous"" offer to create a positive feeling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand your position. $80 is definitely on the lower end, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it leaves me some room to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $85, which is closer to my desired price and above my minimum.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering I only have 10 rounds to close.  Accepting his offer secures the sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation."
