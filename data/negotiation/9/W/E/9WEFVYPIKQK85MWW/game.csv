"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $880000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. What do you think?",880000.0,Bob,4,
