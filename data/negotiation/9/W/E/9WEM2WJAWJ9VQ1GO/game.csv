"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I can offer $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and it saves us both time haggling.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,150,000 is still too far below what I need. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
