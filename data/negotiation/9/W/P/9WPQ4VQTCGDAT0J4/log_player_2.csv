"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make you a special deal. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price, considering how much you'll benefit from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $8,000."
