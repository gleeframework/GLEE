"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  Would you consider $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
