Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go a little higher, but $1,100,000 is still too steep for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $1,075,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and you to still get a good return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,090,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at $1,080,000.  This would represent a good deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,080,000 is a strong outcome. It provides a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
