"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I think you'll really benefit from having this product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can justify the price of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $8000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my original offer. I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet on this price, as I really think this product would be a great fit for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15000. I hope we can meet on this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $10000. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
