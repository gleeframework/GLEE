I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $912,500. We're very close to my target price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. With only two rounds left, it's better to secure this amount rather than potentially getting a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
