Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise at $925,000. This price is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly below your estimated value.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $890,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $890,000 is a good deal considering the time remaining and the risk of selling to John for a lower amount.  This offer meets my minimum, and it's likely Bob won't offer more."
