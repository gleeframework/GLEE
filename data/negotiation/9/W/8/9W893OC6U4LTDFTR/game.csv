"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $725,000? That's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to meeting you in the middle, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in this product. How about we try $850,000? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
