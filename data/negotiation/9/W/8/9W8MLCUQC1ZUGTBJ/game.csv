"Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford $11000 right now. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $12500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think $12500 is a good offer, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $14000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Alice,5,
