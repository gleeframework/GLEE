"Alice, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better than $15,000. How about $13,500? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000? This is a significant drop from your last offer, but it's my absolute maximum right now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $10,000. How about $11,750? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $11,750 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to make a final offer of $9,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to make a deal happen, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $11,000? It's a price that's closer to what you're looking for, and it's still a good deal for me.",11000.0,Alice,7,
