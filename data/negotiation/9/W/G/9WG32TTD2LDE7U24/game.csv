"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to make a profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering your potential profit and my need to make a reasonable return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
