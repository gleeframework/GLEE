"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than John's but still leaves room for negotiation. There's a potential to save more money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering your potential profit and my need to make a reasonable return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's still lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and allows Bob to make a significant profit. While there's a chance of getting a slightly lower price by continuing negotiations, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
