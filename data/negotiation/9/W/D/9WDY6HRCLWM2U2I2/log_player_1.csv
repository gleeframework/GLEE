Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, while also making it clear that I believe the product is worth a significant amount. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer of $10,000 in mind as a safety net, but I want to maximize my profits if possible. 
* **Bob's Reactions:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's responses to adjust my negotiation strategy. If he seems very interested, I might be able to push for a higher price. If he's hesitant, I might be willing to lower the price slightly to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential to Earn More:**  I'm confident that I can secure a higher price than $12,500. 
* **No Immediate Need:**  I'm not under pressure to sell immediately, so I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $12,500 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $14,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price from $15,000 to $14,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profitable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating my belief in the product's value and suggesting that $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking Bob to consider the offer. I'm prepared to discuss a slightly lower price if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he's still hesitant, I might be willing to go down to $13,500. However, if he seems more receptive, I'll try to hold firm at $14,000. I'll also keep John's offer of $10,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though I'm not getting my full asking price, accepting Bob's offer could potentially lead to future business opportunities with him.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. I'll also try to build a positive relationship with Bob for future transactions."
