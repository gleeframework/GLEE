Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $15,000 because John will pay that.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so I need to offer him something that's still appealing but gives me a decent profit. 
* **Negotiation room:** By offering $12,000, I leave room for negotiation. Bob may counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Potential win-win:** This price offers Bob a good deal, potentially better than his initial expectation, while still allowing me to earn a substantial profit."
