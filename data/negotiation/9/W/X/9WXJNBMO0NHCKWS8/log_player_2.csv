Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $105 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, I think. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $102. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $105. How about we try $102.50?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $102.5 is getting closer to your ideal price, you're still only a couple of dollars away from your target of $100. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get Alice to budge even further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. How about we split the difference at $101?  Let's finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 101} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $103. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $101 and $105. How about we try $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, you've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and the price is getting very close to your target of $100. Accepting the offer of $102 is a good compromise, especially considering you have a backup option with John at $120.  It's unlikely that you'll be able to get a lower price in the remaining rounds, and it's a good deal for you."
