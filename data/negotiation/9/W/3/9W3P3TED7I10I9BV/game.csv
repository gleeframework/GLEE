"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is around $1200000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to the higher end of the spectrum. Let's aim for a price of $1000000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can work together to make it happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this price reflects a fair balance between the product's value to me and your desired profit. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000 again, as I feel it's below my minimum threshold. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1000000. Let's aim for a price of $975000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $975000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product. I think this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I've already made several concessions. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $975000, as it's still below my minimum threshold. Considering we've been negotiating for a few rounds, I'm willing to make a slight concession. Let's aim for a price of $980000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the fact that we're close to the final round.",980000.0,Alice,7,
