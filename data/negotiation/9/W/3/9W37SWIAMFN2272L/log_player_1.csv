"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  It's a high offer, but I'm willing to reduce it if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can still get a higher price if I continue to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still above my minimum and closer to my initial offer, showing that I am willing to negotiate but also holding firm on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price if I continue to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm going to counter with $102. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, showing that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob.  However, it's still above my minimum, so it's a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $98.  While it's not the highest I've been offered, it's still a good price and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might lose the deal altogether.  It's also just one dollar less than what John would pay, so it's a good compromise."
