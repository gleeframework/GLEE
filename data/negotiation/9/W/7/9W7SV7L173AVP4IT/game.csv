"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 is below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
