"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than John's price, you can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $120 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $140 and the product's value to her of $120.  This is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident she'll accept or counter with a price closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still better than John's price of $150.  While I could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk Alice will reject again and I'll be forced to buy from John. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a decent price."
