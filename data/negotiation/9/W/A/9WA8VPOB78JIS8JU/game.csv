"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you. My initial asking price is $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $8000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000.  That's a good step in the right direction.  However, I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  I'm willing to pay $8500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  While $8500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8750. This is a fair price, and it would be a good deal for both of us. Let's seal the deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
