Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit.  It also includes a positive and encouraging message to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth selling to him for such a low amount. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I've countered Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up a bit in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable value than his previous offers.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
