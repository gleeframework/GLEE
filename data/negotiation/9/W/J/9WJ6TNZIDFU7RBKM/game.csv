"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, which is at least $15000 to me.  I'm confident this product can bring you substantial benefits. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value the product at more than $15000, I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  How about $17500?  This would still leave me a reasonable profit, and it's significantly less than my initial offer.  What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",16000.0,Bob,4,
