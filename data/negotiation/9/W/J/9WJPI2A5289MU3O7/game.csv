"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle of that and $950,000.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and settle on $935,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but I think I can do better than $935,000. I'm hoping we can get closer to my target price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
