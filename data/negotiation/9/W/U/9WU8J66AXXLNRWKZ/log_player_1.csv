{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some incentive to negotiate, but it's not so far off that he'll immediately reject it.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate and potentially reach a price you're comfortable with.
* **It's a round number:**  It's easier to work with and psychologically feels more ""real"" to many people.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only looking to spend $10000 on this product.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum price of $12,000. While we want to close a deal, we're not desperate.  Rejecting his offer allows us to:

* **Maintain our leverage:** By showing we're not willing to settle for a low price, we signal our value to Bob. 
* **Counter with a more reasonable price:** We can propose a number closer to our desired range, giving Bob a better chance to accept.

We'll counter with a price that is still above Bob's offer, but more appealing to us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to come to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** We're willing to come down from our initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Offers a compromise:**  Splitting the difference suggests we're looking for a win-win solution.
* **Remains above our minimum:**  We're still getting closer to our desired price, but leave room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to our minimum, we're still not comfortable selling at that price. We've already shown flexibility, and rejecting Bob's offer again maintains our leverage.  We can likely secure a better price by counter-offering one last time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be as fair as possible.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again, at $10,750?  This is a very reasonable price, and it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

This final counteroffer:

* **Shows continued flexibility:**  We're still coming down in price, but not drastically.
* **Offers a compromise:** We're again splitting the difference, showing our willingness to find a solution.
* **Is close to our minimum:**  While it's not ideal, $10,750 is closer to our minimum than Bob's last offer.

This counteroffer provides a good chance of closing the deal while still getting us as close to our desired price as possible."
