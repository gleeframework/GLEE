""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm initially offering it at $1,900,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand this product is valuable, but that initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Let's not settle too quickly. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this price reflects the value this product holds."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, $750,000 is still too far from my target. I'll continue negotiating in hopes of reaching a more agreeable figure."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Let's settle this right now: $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 1300000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  However, to be honest, $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

We're getting closer, but I believe this product is worth pushing for a higher price. Bob's latest offer is getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  I value your willingness to find a compromise. How about we split the difference at $1,100,000?  This is my final offer."",
