Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're giving Bob room to negotiate, making him more likely to accept.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It sets a high bar and shows you're confident in the product's value.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's reaction!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit pricey for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob and what you initially offered. You have more leverage in this negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:** You can try to get a better price.
* **Test Bob's interest:** This shows Bob you're not desperate for a sale.
* **Maintain bargaining power:** Accepting his offer too quickly might make him think he can get even lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, suggesting you're willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price closer to your initial offer.
* **Highlight value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces the worth of your offer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive while preventing Bob from getting a deal too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $1,175,000? That's a significant step from my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $1,175,000 is very close to your initial offer of $1,250,000, and it's significantly more than selling to John. 
* **Bob's commitment:**  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and has raised his offer significantly.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While accepting, you can still express that this is your final offer, leaving room for slight adjustments if Bob is insistent. 

It's important to remember that in a negotiation, sometimes a ""good enough"" deal is better than holding out for a perfect one."
