Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $7,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $7,250. This is as low as I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250

At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** You're getting the product for $7,250, a saving of $750 from John's price and significantly less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** If you push further and Alice refuses, you'll have to go with John anyway, losing the potential for a better deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Further negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
