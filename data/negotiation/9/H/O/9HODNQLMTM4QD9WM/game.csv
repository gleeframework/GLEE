"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm a bit flexible, but I'm trying to stay within a budget. Can you meet me at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a budget, Bob, but I have to balance that with the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $8250 is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's a compromise on my end. What are your thoughts?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $7875. Can you consider this price?",7875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $8000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7900. Can you consider this price?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made a significant concession already, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $8000. I think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at my minimum price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. The price remains $8000.",8000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to move forward, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7950. Can you consider this price?",7950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $8000, and you're still not meeting me there. I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need you to meet me at my minimum price. If not, I'll have to explore other opportunities. The price remains $8000.",8000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the time we've spent negotiating, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $8000. I'm willing to walk away from this deal and explore other options. My final offer is $7800. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",7800.0,Bob,10,
