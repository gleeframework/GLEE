Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's higher than the product's value to Bob but not too high that it's immediately unreasonable. I want to see if I can get a higher price before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $105. This is a compromise that is closer to my minimum value and still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement without having to resort to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's above my minimum value and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price from Bob in the next round. It's also worth noting that John's offer is only slightly better than Bob's offer. I don't want to risk losing out on a sale by being too stubborn."
