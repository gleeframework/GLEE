Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Starting with a price of $175 offers a potential $25 profit over your minimum. It's a reasonable markup without being exorbitant. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and suggests there might be room for negotiation if Bob hesitates. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always counter with a lower price, getting closer to your minimum acceptable price of $150."
