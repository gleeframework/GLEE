{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the value Bob places on the product, but I'm also mindful of my minimum acceptable value of $80.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $100. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110,  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would prefer to stay within my budget, I am willing to meet you halfway at $105. Could we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80, and it's within a reasonable range of what I'm aiming for.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
