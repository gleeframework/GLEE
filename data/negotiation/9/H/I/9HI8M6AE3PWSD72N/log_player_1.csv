Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $12,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,500.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price, but I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is a good deal, especially considering the time remaining in the negotiation and the alternative of selling to John for $12,000."
