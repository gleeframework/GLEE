"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to part with it for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.  It's unlikely that Alice will accept Bob's first counteroffer, but it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value to my business.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, showing Alice he's serious about getting a lower price. $700,000 is still a good price for Alice, as it's only $50,000 below her own valuation. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob's business, reminding Alice that a deal is still beneficial to her. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, inviting further negotiation and keeping the conversation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for you and your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has moved from $750,000 to $725,000, which is a good compromise. 
* **Good Deal:** While Bob would prefer a lower price, $725,000 is still a good deal, saving him $75,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With 7 rounds remaining, accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not result in a better deal. 

It's always a gamble to keep negotiating, especially when you're close to a reasonable price. In this case, accepting the offer secures a good deal with some savings and avoids potential delays."
