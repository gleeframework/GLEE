"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that is higher than its intrinsic value to you, while still ensuring a good profit margin for me. Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! However, I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your position, I must maintain a fair profit margin for the business. Therefore, I am unable to accept $8,500. I propose we meet in the middle at $9,000. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $8,750? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to sell the product for $9,250. This price ensures a reasonable profit margin for my business while still being competitive. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",9250.0,Alice,5,
