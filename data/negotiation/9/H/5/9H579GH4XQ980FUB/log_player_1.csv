{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but ensuring I get a profit.  It's important to be assertive but also open to compromise in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is still a decent price, it's too low for my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $1,200,000?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm going to stick with my minimum price for now.  This offer is fair to both of us.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept."
