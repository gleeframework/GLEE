"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The high initial price is framed as reflecting the ""value and potential"" of the product, not just its immediate worth to Bob.
* **Alternative:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 is my safety net. I'll keep this in mind as Bob and I negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value.  This indicates he's aiming for a very aggressive deal. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to steer the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to find a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  I'm lowering my price by $200,000, which signals flexibility but keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's potential value to counter Bob's lowball offer and justify the higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still a considerable distance from Bob's offer, giving me room to negotiate further while keeping the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart. While I recognize its value, I can't justify going above $700,000 for this product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum. At this pace, we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Alternative Option:** The guarantee of selling to John for $1,000,000 is becoming increasingly attractive.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and willing to walk away if necessary. This might incentivize Bob to make a more substantial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. Let's meet in the middle - how about $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:**  I'm dropping my price by $150,000, signaling a strong desire to close the deal but without going below my minimum.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a significant increase in his offer.
* **Urgency:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm pushing for a quicker resolution. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still above my minimum, but John's offer is looking more tempting as time passes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to stretch to $750,000 if that works for you. It's a strong offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's offer only increased by $50,000, indicating a reluctance to meet my valuation. We're unlikely to bridge the $200,000 gap in the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of ending up with a worse deal or missing out on John's guaranteed offer.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 secures my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the sure win."
