Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This gives Bob a good deal, as it's still less than the value he places on the product ($100). At the same time, it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, so I'm still getting a good return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90, which is still a good deal for Bob, and hopefully enough to convince him to accept. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still ensures I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer. It's time to accept and close the deal.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
