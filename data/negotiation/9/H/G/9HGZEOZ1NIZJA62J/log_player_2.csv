"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity:

* **Potential for a lower price:** Alice might be willing to negotiate, especially since she values the product at $8,000. She could come back with a lower offer closer to her valuation. 

It's always best to explore potential savings before settling for a higher price, even if the difference seems small."
