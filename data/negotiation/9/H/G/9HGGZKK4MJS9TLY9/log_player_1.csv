Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so I have room to budge if needed. 

This initial offer will test Bob's willingness to pay and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I'm going to reject it for now. I believe I can still push for a better price.  

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,600,000.  This is a slight decrease from my initial offer of $1,700,000, showing flexibility while still staying above Bob's offer of $1,400,000. I'm hoping this demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm wary of potentially losing more value. John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so it's safer and more financially beneficial to sell to him at this point."
