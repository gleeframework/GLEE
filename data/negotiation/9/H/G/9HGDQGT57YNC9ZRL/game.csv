"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy now. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that you're a serious buyer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to close the deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'll make one more concession, and I'll counteroffer at $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
