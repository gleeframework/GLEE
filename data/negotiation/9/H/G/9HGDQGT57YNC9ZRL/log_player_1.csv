Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
