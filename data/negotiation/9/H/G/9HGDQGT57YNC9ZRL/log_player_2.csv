# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.
* There is room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that you're a serious buyer.

* It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price, making this offer the most advantageous for Bob."
