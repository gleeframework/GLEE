It's way too early to accept Alice's offer.  The product could be worth much less than $500,000 to Alice, and we can likely get a better deal by negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}

Let's start with a low offer of $250,000. This will give us a good starting point for negotiation and see how Alice responds."

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to negotiate a better price. Let's see if we can get closer to our ideal price."
