"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal for Bob to buy at $9,000 since it's worth only $8,000 to him.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,200. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
