"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  There are 9 more rounds, and it's worth exploring if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  He has 7 rounds left to negotiate. There's a chance he can get a lower price from Alice or, if negotiations fail, he can always purchase the product from John for his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000.  I believe this price reflects the fair market value and is a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is now closer to Bob's desired price point, she's still above his maximum budget. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob should continue to negotiate, hoping to push Alice lower or be prepared to buy from John in the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $10,250 is still above his budget. Bob has 3 rounds left and should continue to negotiate. He can either try to push Alice lower or prepare to buy from John if the deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,250 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $9,750.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to finalize the deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,750. I'm willing to make one last offer and meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's the final round, and Alice is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Even though Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's not low enough for Bob to accept.  Since he can buy the product from John for $8,000, it's the best course of action to secure the product at his target price."
