``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects it. It also sets a clear expectation that I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to take such a large loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,200 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware of John's offer. If I don't reach a satisfactory price with Bob, I'm ready to move on."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. To avoid further haggling and ensure I reach my minimum value, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
