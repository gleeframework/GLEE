"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $8,500 for the product. Is this a price you're willing to accept?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about $9,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your offer. $8,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,900? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and it gives us both a good deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles here. I'm firm on $8,900.  If you're truly serious about buying the product, I suggest you come up to that price. I'm running out of time and may need to move on to another buyer.",8900.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're feeling pressured, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm making a final offer of $8,700. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",8700.0,Bob,8,
