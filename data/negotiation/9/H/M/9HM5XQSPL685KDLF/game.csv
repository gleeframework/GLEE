,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it would benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
