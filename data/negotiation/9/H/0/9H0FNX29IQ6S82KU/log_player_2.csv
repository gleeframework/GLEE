It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $12,000."

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than your maximum. This gives you some room to negotiate and potentially find a price that works for both of you."

Alice has come down in price, but it's still worth seeing if you can get a better deal.  You're still closer to your target price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."

This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing from your previous offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. It's a good strategy to show Alice you are willing to negotiate but still want to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much lower. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal from John and save yourself the hassle of further negotiations."
