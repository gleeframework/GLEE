"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, closer to our $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,500? I'm serious about buying the product if we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,500) leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm looking for a substantial discount. 
* **Polite and encouraging:** The message emphasizes my interest in the product and willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Alice to continue the conversation.
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer is closer to my target price ($8,000) than Alice's initial offer ($10,000), giving me a stronger position in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my desired price, $8,250 is still above my absolute limit from John ($8,000).  There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate a bit further. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm trying to stay within a tight budget, and $8,250 is a little bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would work really well for me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking middle ground:** By suggesting $7,500, I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between Alice's current offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a favorable deal.
* **Direct and clear:** I'm stating my budget limitations directly and clearly, reinforcing the importance of a lower price.
* **Final attempt:** This counteroffer likely represents my last attempt to negotiate a price below $8,000 with Alice. If she rejects this, I will likely buy from John."
