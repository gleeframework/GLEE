"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $10,000 is still more than your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9250? This would be a great price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your target.  There's room to negotiate further.  Let's see if you can get a lower price."

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but it's still over your limit.  At this point, you're better off buying from John for $8,000.  While you might be able to get Alice down to $8,500 with more negotiation, it's not worth the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
