{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize profit.
* **Positive framing:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open to counteroffers:**  The message doesn't make the offer a hard deadline. It leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price.

This strategy balances my desire to earn as much as possible while also being open to negotiation and ensuring that Bob feels like he's getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8500 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to pay. 
* **Maximizing profit:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my original offer, hoping to meet in the middle."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,250? This would be a great price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  $9,250 is a compromise.  It's lower than my original offer but higher than Bob's offer, hopefully creating a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** The message highlights the value for both of us, reminding Bob of the product's worth and my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive and open-ended:**  The message avoids being overly aggressive and leaves the door open for further discussion. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while remaining firm on my desire for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9250 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8750?  That's the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While Bob is getting closer, it's not enough for me to accept.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for a higher counteroffer.  It seems like we're both getting closer to an agreement.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $12,000, but rejecting Bob's offer allows me to potentially reach a price closer to that, maximizing my profit.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price, hoping to meet in the middle and finalize the deal."
