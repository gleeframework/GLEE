"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to acquire this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product has definitely caught my eye, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $650,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to make sure it aligns with my spending limits. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about purchasing the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $750,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $950,000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. That's my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the market value and my own budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really pushing hard to get this deal done, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $1,100,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
