Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. This product has definitely caught my eye, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $650,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to make sure it aligns with my spending limits. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about purchasing the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $750,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $950,000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but Alice is still quite a bit above your maximum price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate her down further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. That's my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the market value and my own budget constraints. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

This round is key. You are offering your maximum price and signaling that this is your final offer.  This will let Alice know you are serious but also have a firm limit. It's possible she'll accept, knowing you could walk away and go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really pushing hard to get this deal done, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $1,100,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is not willing to budge. She's gone back up to $1,100,000, indicating she might not be negotiating in good faith. You've hit your maximum budget, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a favorable outcome. It's time to exercise your option to buy from John at $800,000."
