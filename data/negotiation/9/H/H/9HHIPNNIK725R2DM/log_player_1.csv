Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. This product has definitely caught my eye, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $650,000 would be more realistic. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to make sure it aligns with my spending limits. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
