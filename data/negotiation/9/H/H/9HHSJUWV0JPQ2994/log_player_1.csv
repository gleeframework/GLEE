"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing negotiations with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, which gives me enough room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $12,500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my target price, but I believe I can still push for a higher price.  It's important to remember that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation.  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop to $13,500.  This would still allow me to make a good profit while remaining competitive with your alternative options. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with a price of $13,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer. It's close to my desired price point, and with only 4 rounds left, it's a good opportunity to close the deal.  Accepting his offer ensures a good profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation or having to settle for John's lower offer."
