We are very close to a deal, but Alice is unwilling to budge further. With only one round left, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is high.  Since John offers a known price of $1,500,000, which is my maximum limit, it's better to secure the product from him and avoid the uncertainty of a final negotiation with Alice."
