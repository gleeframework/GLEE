"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking to get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is a fair offer, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still allows for a significant return on your investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase if we can agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
