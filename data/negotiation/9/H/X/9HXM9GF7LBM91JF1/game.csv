"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
