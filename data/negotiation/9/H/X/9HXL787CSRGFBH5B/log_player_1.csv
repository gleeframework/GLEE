Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation but higher than John's offer.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a significant profit. 

**Why this approach is better than offering $12,000 directly:**

* Offering the product at Bob's maximum valuation ($12,000) leaves no room for negotiation and might make Bob hesitant, knowing he's not getting any ""deal."" 
* A slightly lower starting point increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer without further negotiation."
