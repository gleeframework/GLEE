"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what Alice values the product at.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $750,000, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $950,000 is still a significant amount above Bob's target of $750,000. There's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to meet Alice halfway again, or go even lower to test her limits.  It's unlikely Alice will accept $750,000 but this counteroffer could push her closer to the desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers your profit margin and my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000, which is still a good deal considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:**  $925,000 is only $75,000 away from Bob's last counteroffer. This shows Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might not be worth it:**  At this point, it's a matter of $75,000.  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. 
* **The potential risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice might become less flexible, or Bob might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price.

**Conclusion:**  It's a good time for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's still within his budget and a good deal compared to John's price."
