"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it provides to your business will more than justify the price.  Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above my target price of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm happy to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This price still provides significant value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still above my target. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a fair price that's within my range and will allow us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925000 is still a bit lower than what I can realistically accept. How about we meet in the middle at $937500? This allows us both to compromise and close the deal without either of us feeling like we lost too much. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $937,500 is very close to my desired price, and it's definitely better than John's offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that I'll run out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoid the potential of losing out completely."
