Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it provides to your business will more than justify the price.  Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm happy to pay $900000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price in the next round.  While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still provides significant value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to offer $925000. This is a fair price that's within my range and will allow us to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my target price, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counter with a price closer to $950,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925,000 is still a bit lower than what I can realistically accept. How about we meet in the middle at $937,500? This allows us both to compromise and close the deal without either of us feeling like we lost too much."", ""product_price"": 937500}
