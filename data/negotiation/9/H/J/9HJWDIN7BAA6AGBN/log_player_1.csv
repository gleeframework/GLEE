Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower my price, but I still have room to earn more than my minimum.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While $800,000 is better than selling to John for $1,000,000,  I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,200,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a profit significantly higher than my minimum. I hope this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum goal. I'm not yet ready to settle, as I believe we can still reach a higher price through further negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to encourage him to raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a further compromise that still allows me to get closer to my desired profit. I believe this offer is reasonable and might be enough to persuade Bob to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough to satisfy my minimum goal.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to go much higher.  I'm  comfortable selling to John for $1,000,000, which guarantees my minimum profit and avoids any further risk of losing more money through continued negotiation."
