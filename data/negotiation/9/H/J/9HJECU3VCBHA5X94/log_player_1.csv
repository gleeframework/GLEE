Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer. It also shows that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm proposing a price that's midway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum value. Although I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer is better than selling to John for less."
