Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,500 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $10,500. This is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. Can you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to push for a higher price, $10,000 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John.  It's important to close the deal and secure the sale."
