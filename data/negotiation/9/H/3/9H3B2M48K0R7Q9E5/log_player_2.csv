"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $100. It's definitely worth more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product.  Alice is offering it at $100. Since you have an alternative (buying from John for the same price), rejecting Alice's offer gives you no downside.  You might be able to get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or waiting for a better offer, so rejecting her current offer is the best strategy."
