{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune, and I believe you'd find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity, so let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and I want to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,000,000? This price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from this incredible deal. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
