"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a better offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $10,500.  How about we settle at $10,400? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal quickly.",10400.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to come down to $10,300. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",10300.0,Alice,7,
