Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,600,000, I'm setting a high anchor point. While Bob might counter, his counter will likely be influenced by this initial high number.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate within this price range. 
 
It's important to remember:  Even though I have John as a backup, my goal is to maximize profit. Securing a deal with Bob above $1,200,000 is ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to his perceived value, I know I have a guaranteed offer from John. I'll counter-offer to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Staying Above Reserve:** My counter-offer remains comfortably above my reserve price ($1,200,000) and John's standing offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price. 

By making a significant move, I'm hoping Bob will respond in kind, moving us closer to a mutually agreeable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer). While I could potentially negotiate for more, the difference is becoming smaller, and there's a risk Bob could walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
