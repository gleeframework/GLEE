Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't go lower than that.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Negotiation space:**  There's a $5,000 gap between our values.  
* **First offer:**  I'm starting at $14,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Aggressive, but fair:** This offer is ambitious, but not unreasonable. It leaves room for negotiation, but also signals my willingness to be firm.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to counter if Bob makes a low offer. However, I have the safety net of John's offer, so I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, so I don't need to settle for a bad deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I will not accept anything significantly lower than my initial offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial $14,000, but with a slightly lower amount to acknowledge Bob's counter. This shows flexibility without giving away too much. 
* **John's offer:** I will use John's offer as a benchmark for my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer was too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **My initial offer was ambitious:** I need to show some willingness to compromise, but not too much. 
* **Middle ground:**  $13,000 represents a reasonable compromise halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($11,000).

**Strategy:**

* **Signal flexibility:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still significantly above Bob's offer, and I have John's offer as a safety net. 
* **Prepare for potential rejection:**  Bob might still reject my counteroffer, but this price gives him a fair opportunity to meet my needs while still potentially making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $12,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is stalled:**  Bob's offers have not been increasing significantly, suggesting he may be unwilling to meet my price expectations.
* **John's offer is a safe and profitable option:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is significantly more than what Bob is offering.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimize risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further concessions and a lower sale price. 
* **Maximize profit:**  Selling to John ensures I achieve my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I am willing to negotiate, I am not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product. Selling to John provides the most profitable and risk-free solution."
