Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profits while keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to secure a price closer to my desired value. This leaves a little room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While it's still above my minimum, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
