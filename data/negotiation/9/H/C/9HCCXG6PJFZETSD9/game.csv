"Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is limited. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $14,000, which is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
