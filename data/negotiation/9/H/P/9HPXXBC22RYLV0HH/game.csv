"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's the lowest I can go.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and meet at $7,750? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little further to make this deal work. How about $8,000? That's my absolute minimum, and it still gives you a good price.  Let's make this happen!",8000.0,Alice,5,
