Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,500. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  This allows her to start with a significantly higher offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value and the potential for it to be sold elsewhere, justifying the higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere above the $12,000 mark. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is particularly price-sensitive, she might want to lower her initial offer slightly.
* **Market Conditions:** If similar products are selling for significantly less than $15,500, Alice might need to adjust her price."
