Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a great deal for something you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a price slightly below her guaranteed sale price to John, she creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Optional):** While not explicitly part of this interaction, starting high leaves Alice room to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob counters."
