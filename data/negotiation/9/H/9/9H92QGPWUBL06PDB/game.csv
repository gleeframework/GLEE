"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $975,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said $1,075,000 is your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still make this work. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's more than fair.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
