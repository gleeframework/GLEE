Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to sell for $100, as it's less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're interested in a lower price, Bob.  However, $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110,  but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm still not comfortable selling for $105. I'll counteroffer again, but if Bob doesn't budge, I might have to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 107.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've made several concessions and it seems like Bob is stuck at $105.  I'm not going to sell for less than $107.50, and with only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity to sell to John for $120."
