"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $18000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $15000?  I'm confident you'll find this price fair.",15000.0,Alice,3,
