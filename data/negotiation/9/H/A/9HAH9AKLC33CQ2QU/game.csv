"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not able to go that low just yet. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and still gives you a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
