"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product at that price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50. This feels fair to both of us and keeps the deal within my budget.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $109. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",109.0,Alice,5,
