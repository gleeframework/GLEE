"Thanks for the offer Alice! I really appreciate you being flexible, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
