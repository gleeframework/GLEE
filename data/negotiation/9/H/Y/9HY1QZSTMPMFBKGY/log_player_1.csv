"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a better price.  I have 9 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe there's room for a counteroffer that might bring Bob closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1,500,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the value I've placed on the product and also gives you a substantial discount.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1750000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1625000 is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,625,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,675,000. This shows my commitment to making a deal, but it's also a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1675000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1675000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price, and I have 4 rounds left. There's a chance I can get closer to $1,675,000. I'll see if I can convince Bob to increase his offer slightly."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $1,600,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and propose $1,637,500.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1637500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I need you to meet me at that price. I'm getting close to exploring other options, so let's see if we can make it work.

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good price, considering I only have 2 rounds left.  It's also within a reasonable range of my desired price.  Accepting this offer avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me having to settle for the $1,500,000 offer from John."
