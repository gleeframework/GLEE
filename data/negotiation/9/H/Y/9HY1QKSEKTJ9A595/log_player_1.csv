Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know this product would be valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price is significantly higher than your backup offer from John ($12,000), ensuring a good profit.

By offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum, you increase the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a great deal for yourself."
