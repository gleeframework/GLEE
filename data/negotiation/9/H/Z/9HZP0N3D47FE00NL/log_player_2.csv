"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. John's offer of $12,000 acts as a fallback, ensuring you won't be left without the product. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the possibility for a counter-offer closer to her $8,000 value or closer to John's $12,000 offer."
