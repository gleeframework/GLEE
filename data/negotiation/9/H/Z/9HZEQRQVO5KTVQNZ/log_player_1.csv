Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is negotiating. While $1,050,000 is a good profit, we're still early in the negotiation and there's room to push for a higher price.  We'll aim for a price closer to $1,150,000 in the next round."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000 again. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now offered $1,050,000 twice. This indicates that this is likely his upper limit, and further haggling may not result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a good profit ($250,000 over our minimum) and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
