"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's worth to me.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept or counter with a reasonable offer. If he rejects this price, we can continue the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my desired profit. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a higher price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting close to my minimum, and we are in the middle of the negotiation process.  It is reasonable to accept this offer and close the deal.  While I could continue to negotiate, there is a risk of Bob walking away, or me selling to John at a lower price."
