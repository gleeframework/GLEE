"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but still higher than Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation while also making it clear I am serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell it for that.  I will try to counteroffer him to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $90,  a final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to pay $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough.  I'm not willing to go lower, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $120, which is much more favorable than continuing negotiations with Bob."
