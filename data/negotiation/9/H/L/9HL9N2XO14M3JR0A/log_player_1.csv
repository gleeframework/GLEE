Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $180. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $180, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, we can always fall back to John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value (""worth a lot"") without overselling it, aiming to pique Bob's interest and justify the higher price."
