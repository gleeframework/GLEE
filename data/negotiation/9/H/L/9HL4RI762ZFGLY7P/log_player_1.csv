"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me some room to negotiate down if needed. It's also a good test of Bob's interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not eager to sell at that price right away. There are still 8 rounds left to try and get a better price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still leaves me some profit.  It also shows that I'm serious about selling the product, but that I'm not going to accept his first lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. There are still 6 rounds left and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'll counteroffer Bob again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a further compromise, but it still gives me a bit more profit than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal, but if not, I'm still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered $125, which is above my minimum price of $120.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to continue negotiating.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
