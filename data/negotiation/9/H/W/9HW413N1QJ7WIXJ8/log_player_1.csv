Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find significant value in it."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($120) without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While a starting price of $119 aims high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John ($100), so you can afford to aim higher with Bob."
