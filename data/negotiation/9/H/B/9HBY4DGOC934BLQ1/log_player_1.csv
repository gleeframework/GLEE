"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. $8,250 is a good price, and it's only $250 less than what John is offering. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
