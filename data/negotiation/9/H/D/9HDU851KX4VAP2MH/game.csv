"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to sell the product to you for $9000. This still reflects a premium value over its worth to you, while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
