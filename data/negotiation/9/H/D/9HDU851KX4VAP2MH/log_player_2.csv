# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you the opportunity to purchase our exclusive product for $9500. This is a unique chance to acquire an item valued at $8000 by you, at a premium price. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so it's in his best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to sell the product to you for $9000. This still reflects a premium value over its worth to you, while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still too high for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000.  At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $8,000 to save money and avoid further negotiation."
