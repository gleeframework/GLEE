Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  To show you my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop my price to $940,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'd like to get more from Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's important to remember that John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's very close to my target.  I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
