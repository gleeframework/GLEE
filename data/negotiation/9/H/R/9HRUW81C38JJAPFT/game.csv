"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $100. It's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $90. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product can bring to you.",90.0,Alice,5,
