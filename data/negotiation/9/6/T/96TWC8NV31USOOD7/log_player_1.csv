{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm suggesting the product would be valuable to Bob, which might make him more willing to consider a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for less than $14,000 initially. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and see if it's within my acceptable range.
* If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I'll either counter back with a higher price or just end the negotiation and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, my budget is a bit tighter than that.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value of the product, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below my bottom line.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to find a middle ground between our desired prices. 
* I'll still be willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?  I'm confident this would be a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob that this would still be a great deal for him, even at the higher price. 
* **Staying firm:** I'm not dropping too much below my initial price, as I'm still confident the product is worth more.

**Strategy:**

* By meeting halfway, I'm showing flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* This counteroffer allows for potential for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't come up to a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $13250 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really hoping to keep it under $13000.  Would you be willing to go down to $12800?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, either by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground.
* If Bob still refuses, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000, as this ensures I get my minimum desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident the product is worth more than that.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or reject. 
* **Meeting Halfway Again:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $13,250 and Bob's offer of $12,800. This shows continued willingness to compromise. 
* **Confidence in Value:** I'm reiterating my belief that the product is worth more than $13,000.  This helps me justify my price and maintain my position.

**Strategy:**

* By presenting a final offer, I'm pushing Bob to make a decision. 
* If he rejects, I'll move on to John, as $13,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price. 
* However, I'm still holding out hope that Bob will accept, as it's better than selling to John for $15,000."
