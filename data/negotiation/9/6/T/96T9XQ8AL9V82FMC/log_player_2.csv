"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14000? I think that's a fair price for this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer again. While $14,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. I'm truly interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's getting closer to his target price, but $13,500 is still more than he wants to pay. He should continue negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really want to work with you on this, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is my absolute final offer.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $14000 for it. How about we meet at $14000? I think that's a fair price for this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is still too high, and it's unlikely she will go lower.  He's already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear she's not willing to meet his price. It's better to cut his losses and buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000."
