"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $8,500? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price for this valuable product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
