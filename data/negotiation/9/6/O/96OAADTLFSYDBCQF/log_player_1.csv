Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a budget of $7,500. Would you be able to accommodate this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $8,500? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price for this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me, and it's a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob in the future."
