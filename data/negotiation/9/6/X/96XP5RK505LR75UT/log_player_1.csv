``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to be flexible, which can encourage Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get this product for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1,062,500.  This feels fair to me, and hopefully, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum threshold. It's worth making one more counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
