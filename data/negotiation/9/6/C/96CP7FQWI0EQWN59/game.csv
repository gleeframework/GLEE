"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe you'll find the product to be highly profitable. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay full price.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
