"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You have a good chance of getting a better deal since you know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000. This gives you a solid point of reference during negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than John's price. This gives Alice room to negotiate while also demonstrating your willingness to pay a fair price. The goal is to find a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price. There's a chance to push for a lower price, especially since Alice already rejected your previous counteroffer.  It's worth continuing the negotiation and potentially securing a better deal than $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases your previous offer by $50,000, showing that you are willing to compromise but still trying to reach a price closer to your ideal point.  This demonstrates a genuine effort to negotiate without going too low and risking Alice completely withdrawing from the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $125,000 more than John's price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice completely, especially since she has already rejected several counteroffers.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product while still saving a significant amount compared to her initial offer.  It's a reasonable compromise that balances your goal of saving money with the need to finalize the purchase."
