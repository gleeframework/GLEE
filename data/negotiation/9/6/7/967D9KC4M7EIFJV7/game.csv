"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $150, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to the final price, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $10. I'll meet you at $155, and that's my final offer. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
