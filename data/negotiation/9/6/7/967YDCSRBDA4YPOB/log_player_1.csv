Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's above your minimum value but still below Bob's estimated value, making it a potentially appealing offer.
* The message is friendly and direct, setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he rejects immediately, you know he might be willing to pay closer to your minimum.
* **Start the negotiation process:** It allows for potential counteroffers and allows you to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed $10,000 from John gives you leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum value.**  Accepting it would mean no profit beyond your baseline. 
* **Rejecting gives you leverage:** You can use the counteroffer stage to try and secure a higher price or see if Bob is willing to budge. 
* **John is still an option:**  The threat of selling to John keeps the pressure on Bob to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

The next round will involve you making a counteroffer to Bob.  You'll need to decide on a price point that balances your desire for profit with the risk of Bob walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget, I'm not able to go down to $10,000 at this point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal as well.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Offering $11,000 is a compromise that shows you're willing to negotiate. It's a signal that you're serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message reminds Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing that $11,000 is still a good price for him.
* **Setting the stage for a potential final offer:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can likely make a final counteroffer closer to your minimum ($10,000) or sell to John."
