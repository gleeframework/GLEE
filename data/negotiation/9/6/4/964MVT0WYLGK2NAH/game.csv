"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $1,050,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of $1,075,000. I think this is as low as I can go and still make it worth my while. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
