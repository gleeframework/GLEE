{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer allows for a healthy profit margin while still potentially being appealing to Bob, as he values the product at $10,000.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,200 is a bit low for me, considering its value. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,600? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $8,600. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing this sale entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer will ensure a sale at a price that is only slightly below my desired range."
