"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $12,500 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between $12,500 and $13,250? That would put the price at $12,875. I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",12875.0,Bob,4,
