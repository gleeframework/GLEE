Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum price.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, and Bob is likely to see this as a good deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $125 is a bit high for me. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum value of $100, and it's likely we won't get a better offer from him.  It's also a good starting point for future negotiations if we need them."
