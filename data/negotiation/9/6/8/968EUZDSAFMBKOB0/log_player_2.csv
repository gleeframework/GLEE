"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $8,500? That gives us both some room to work with.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price, but he needs to keep in mind that he has limited rounds and can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8250}
