"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Alice's offer since the product is worth $1,500,000 to her and she is offering it to me for $2,000,000. I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal.
