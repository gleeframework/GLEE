"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) to encourage Bob to negotiate.
* The price is higher than the product's worth to Bob ($1,000,000), but leaves room for bargaining.
* The message is friendly and optimistic to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* I'm not willing to sell at such a loss, so I will reject his offer and continue negotiating. 
* There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to try and reach a more agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about $950,000? This gives you a good price and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm countering with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his estimated value of $1,000,000. 
* This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage further negotiation and a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $875,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* I am not yet ready to sell at such a loss. 
* I have 6 rounds remaining, so there is still time to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal.  Let's try $925,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer.  I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to show that I'm willing to negotiate.
* This offer is still above Bob's most recent offer of $875,000 but closer to his preferred range. 
* The message emphasizes fairness and finding common ground, signaling a willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for staying with me on this.  $925,000 is getting close, but I need to be around $900,000. Would you consider $890,000? I think that's a very fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $890,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* I have 4 rounds remaining, so I can still try to get a better price from Bob.
*  I am confident that I can negotiate a higher price, considering Bob's willingness to increase his offer in the last round. 
* Selling to John for $1,200,000 is an option, but I'd like to exhaust all possible negotiations with Bob before going that route."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's split the difference. How about $905,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 905000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I am offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($925,000) and Bob's latest offer ($890,000). 
* This demonstrates a commitment to finding a compromise and closing the deal.
* The message is direct and emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement, creating a sense of finality for Bob. 
* By offering a ""fair price for both of us,"" I am appealing to Bob's sense of reason and fairness."
