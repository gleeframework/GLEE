{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. This strategy balances getting a good price with maintaining the possibility of a deal.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the need to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I am confident I can get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a more suitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. It shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that still benefits me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up to a more acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 still falls short of what I need to accept.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is my best possible price. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I urge you to consider this offer. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  It's still above Bob's last offer, but it's my absolute lowest price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
