"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider the value I've placed on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see, and hopefully, it's a starting point we can both work with.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale.

This is a fair price that balances our interests and gets me closer to my target.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
