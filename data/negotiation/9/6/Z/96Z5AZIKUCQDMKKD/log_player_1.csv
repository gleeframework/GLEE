Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price of $950,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum value ($800,000). This allows for potential counteroffers without immediately triggering a sale to John.
* **Setting the Tone:**  A friendly, but firm message sets the stage for a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to put on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it still demonstrates his interest in the product. This gives me leverage to counter and try to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit, but I want to see if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum value for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum value of $800,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Compromising but Firm:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing that this price still gives Bob a good deal could incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Gain:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price from Bob, and further negotiation might risk him walking away entirely.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While selling to John for the same price is an option, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids any potential delays or uncertainties associated with John."
