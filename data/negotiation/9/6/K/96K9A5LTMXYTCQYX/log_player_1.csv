{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $150, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($120) and John's offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 leaves Bob with a potential $10 gain, incentivizing him to purchase while maximizing your profit.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the product's value to Bob."
