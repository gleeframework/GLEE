Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to settle comfortably at your desired amount if the buyer accepts immediately.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob doesn't automatically mean he's willing to pay that much. There's a chance he values it more, especially if it's something he needs or really wants. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives Alice a safety net. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice doesn't lose out. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Alice could choose to offer a lower price initially, especially if she wants to ensure a quick sale."
