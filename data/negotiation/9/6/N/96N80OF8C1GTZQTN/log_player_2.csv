"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is well above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to own this product, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. If you're still interested, let me know! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, it makes more sense for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
