"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product description] and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum he's willing to pay, rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no immediate advantage to buying from John at the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much as possible. By offering $12,000, he's making a significant counteroffer that demonstrates his interest while leaving room for negotiation. This also gives him some leverage, as he can always go to John if Alice doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13500?  That gives us both some room to be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Rejecting her offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit over budget. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his target price as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  By offering $13,000, he's demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway, but he's also making it clear that he won't go much higher."
