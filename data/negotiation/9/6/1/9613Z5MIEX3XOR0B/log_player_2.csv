"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product to me. However, I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,200, which is only $200 more than Bob's counteroffer of $9,000.  This is a reasonable compromise and saves Bob $800 compared to buying from John.  There's little benefit to further negotiation at this point, as the price difference is minimal."
