It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $9,500 is a significant profit over your minimum of $8,000.
* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has repeated the $9,500 offer twice, suggesting this is likely his ceiling. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away entirely, leaving you with John's $8,000 offer."
