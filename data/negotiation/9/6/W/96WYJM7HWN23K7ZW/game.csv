"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've researched and the market demand. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant and goes beyond the initial figures. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you've placed on the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  However, the value of this product is strongly tied to its unique features and potential, which justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to accept $1,275,000, as a final offer, to avoid further negotiation.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is a reasonable price. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000, which is closer to my original target price. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
