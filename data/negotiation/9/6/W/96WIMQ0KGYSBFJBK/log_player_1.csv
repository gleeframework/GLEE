Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a starting offer, and it's a bit higher than the minimum I would accept. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe this product is worth more than $10,000. I'm hoping Bob sees the value and is willing to meet me in the middle."
