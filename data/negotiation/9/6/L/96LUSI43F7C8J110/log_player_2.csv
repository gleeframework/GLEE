"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is exactly your maximum price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price before committing. There's no downside to rejecting the offer and attempting a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $13,500 is still within my budget. It's a good deal for me, saving me $1,500 compared to buying from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially save a little more, as there's no guarantee of success."
