"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a steal at that price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $10,750. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,250.  This is a fair price that's close to your offer and within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",10250.0,Bob,4,
