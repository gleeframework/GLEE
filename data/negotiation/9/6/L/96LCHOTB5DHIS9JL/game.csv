"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $13000? I believe this would still provide me with a great deal while staying within my financial limits.",13000.0,Bob,2,
