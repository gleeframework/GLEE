Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that as possible while still earning a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $110.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $105 is lower than my initial offer of $110, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than $105 to try to get closer to my target price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Since he offered $105, I'll increase it by $3 to $108. This is still below the $120 value he places on the product, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my minimum price of $100, which is what John is willing to pay. Since I've already rejected a higher offer from Bob, I'll decide to sell the product to John for $100. It's not a bad deal, and I can still earn a profit.
