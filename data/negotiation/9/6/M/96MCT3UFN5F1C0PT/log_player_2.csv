Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a middle ground. Let's settle at $10,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her minimum price of $10,000. This is still more than your maximum budget of $8,000 and more than John's offer. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice. It's best to cut your losses and secure the product from John at a price you're comfortable with."
