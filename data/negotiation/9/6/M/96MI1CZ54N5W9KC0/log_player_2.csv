"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I really like the product, $9,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $8200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $8,200 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so he should continue negotiating to try and get the price lower.  He can reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $8,200 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still a little hesitant. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $8100, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now at a crossroads. While Alice has lowered her price to $8,100, it's still $100 higher than Bob's absolute maximum budget.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and John is offering the product for exactly his budget, it makes sense for Bob to buy from John and avoid any further negotiation."
