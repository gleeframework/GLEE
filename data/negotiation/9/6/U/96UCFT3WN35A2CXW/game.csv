"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $125? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to keep my spending under $100. Could we perhaps aim for $110 as a compromise?",110.0,Bob,4,
