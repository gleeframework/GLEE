"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How about $120? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $120 is less than your maximum price, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer leaves room for negotiation. By rejecting her first offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her own perceived value of $80."
