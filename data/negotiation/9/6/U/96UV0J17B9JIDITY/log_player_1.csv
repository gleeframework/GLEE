"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm trying to establish a starting point that is favorable to me while also leaving space for potential concessions. 
* **Setting a Baseline:** This price is also significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000, which makes it clear that I am not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This maintains my negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but still maintaining a price point that is closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why this price is still fair.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  I'm making it clear that I am willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to continue to lower the price indefinitely.

**Note:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while also showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,500 is still too far below my target. I believe there is still room to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps my leverage high and shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise by reducing my price to $10,000, showing flexibility while still staying closer to my target.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm suggesting a final negotiation attempt, increasing pressure on Bob to accept.

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground while still maintaining a decent profit margin. It also shows Bob that I am serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,250. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still below it.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've been negotiating for several rounds, and there's a good chance that Bob won't budge much further. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum requirement.  It's a more reliable option than risking further negotiation with Bob.

**Note:**  While I'm open to negotiation,  at this point, I'm prioritizing certainty over potentially reaching a lower price with Bob."
