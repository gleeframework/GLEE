"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and allows me to achieve a good return on my investment.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me and your initial offer.",925000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $925,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $937,500. This would still be a significant gain for you, and it allows me to reach a more favorable outcome.  What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $915,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",915000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $915,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to drop my price to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  If you're serious about acquiring this, I believe this is our final offer. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
