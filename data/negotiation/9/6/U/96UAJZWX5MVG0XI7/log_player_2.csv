"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am prepared to consider offers. Given its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers, I am extending an initial offer to sell the product to you at $1,350,000. This price reflects a strategic midpoint between its value to me and its perceived value to you, aiming to be fair while maximizing the return for myself. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and interests, or if you require further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
