"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for $120.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still a decent offer. Since I can sell the product to John for $100, I'll choose option (3) and sell the product to John for $100.
