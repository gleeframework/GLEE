"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There are still 9 rounds left, and I have the option of selling to John for a much better price if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $900,000 for the product. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit shy of your target. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my target. I still have 6 rounds left, so there's time to work out a deal with Bob or move on to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to at least receive $900,000 for the product.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get out of it.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $825,000 as a compromise. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  The negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and Bob's offers are stubbornly below my minimum acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  Given the opportunity to sell to John for $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than anything Bob has offered, it's the most logical choice to secure a much better deal."
