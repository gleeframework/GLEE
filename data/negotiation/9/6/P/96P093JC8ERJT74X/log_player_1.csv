I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the most room to negotiate. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm starting high and hoping he'll come down to a price that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to get a much higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll reject his offer and try one more time to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to drop my price to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, but still gives me a decent profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000 as I don't want to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, $1,500,000 is still acceptable and will allow me to move on."
