"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your offer. While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to let the product go for that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still allows me to achieve a respectable profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
