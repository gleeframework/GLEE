Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down without feeling pressured.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the mutual benefit of the deal, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering a price slightly above my minimum, I can potentially secure a higher price if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a strong backup position. This allows me to be more aggressive in my initial offer without fearing a total loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. My starting offer was already a compromise, so I have room to move slightly without jeopardizing my minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if the negotiation with Bob fails, I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price. This gives me leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer but still above his offer. This will show Bob I'm serious about negotiating but also open to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000? This would allow me to make this deal work while still giving you a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to his but still above his offer.  This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes that this offer is a ""good value"" for Bob, which may encourage him to consider accepting it.
* **Negotiation Range:**  I've lowered my price but still have room to come down further if necessary, which allows for flexibility in future negotiations.
* **Backup Plan:** My backup offer with John provides me with a safety net.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will keep the negotiation moving forward while also protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price point, and it's very near my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and prevents a potential loss.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing the negotiation could be time-consuming, and I have a backup offer from John that's significantly more lucrative.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to move on to other opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision. It balances the need to make a sale with the potential to secure a higher offer from John in the future."
