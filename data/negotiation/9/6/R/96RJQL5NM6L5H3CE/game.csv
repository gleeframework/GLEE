"I've made a significant concession already, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $105. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance service. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 for the product, considering the additional value I'm providing?",105.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While the additional value is appreciated, I am still unable to meet you at $105. My final offer remains at $95. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",95.0,Bob,8,

"I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $105. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if we can't come to an agreement. However, I'll make one last offer: I'll meet you at $100, but only if you're willing to commit to purchasing the product within the next 24 hours. Is that something you'd be interested in?",100.0,Alice,9,
