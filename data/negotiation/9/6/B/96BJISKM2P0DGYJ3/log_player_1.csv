{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), but it still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.  It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This allows me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product. Please let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000. This price allows me to acquire the product without straining my finances too much. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price point of $975,000.  While I'd love to push for a higher price, the risk of further negotiations falling through and having to sell to John for $800,000 is too high.  It's better to lock in a profit of $160,000."
