Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is still too far below my value for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8,500. How about $8,750 as a compromise? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 8875}
