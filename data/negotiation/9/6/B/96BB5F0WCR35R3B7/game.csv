,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is still too far below my value for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8,500. How about $8,750 as a compromise? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal quickly.",8875.0,Alice,5,
