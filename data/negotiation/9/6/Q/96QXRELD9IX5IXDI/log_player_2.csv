"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is $1000000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to see if I can get the price down even further.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm not just going to accept her first offer. I'm hoping to get the price down even further, but I'm also willing to consider her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met me halfway, and $750,000 is a good price for me, considering the product's value and the potential for further negotiation.  Accepting this offer saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John."
