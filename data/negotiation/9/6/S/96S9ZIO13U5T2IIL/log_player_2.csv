I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for me, and I want to see if I can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering Alice $9,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair price, given that the product is only worth $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to pay a bit more to secure the deal with her."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Alice's offer again. While it's lower than her initial price, $10,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a lower price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
