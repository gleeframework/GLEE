"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $100?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about $75?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll meet you at $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  It seems like we are getting closer, but $90 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  My absolute final offer is $80.  If that doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'll need to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
