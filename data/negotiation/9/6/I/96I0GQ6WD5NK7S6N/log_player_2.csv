You can do better than $10,000.  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

You can still do slightly better than $9,250. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your ideal price."
