Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've set the initial price at $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob gets from the product, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting with a higher price, I create space for negotiation and increase the likelihood of getting closer to my desired outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I can then lower the price slightly and try to meet in the middle.
* I'll keep John in mind as a backup buyer, so I won't be afraid to walk away from the deal if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $8500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I know the product is worth $12,000 to him, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Moving to the next round:** Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $10,000.

**Strategy:**

* I'm not in a rush to sell, so I'm willing to continue the negotiation.
* By rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer, I'm showing I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* John remains a backup option if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price of $9,250, which is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $8,500. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefit for Bob, highlighting that the price is still a good deal for him. It also expresses a desire to reach an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** By splitting the difference, I signal my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a strong position:** $9,250 is still a significant profit for me, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Pressure Bob:** This counteroffer puts the pressure on Bob to decide if he wants to accept or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at $9000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** While I would prefer a higher price, $9,000 is a good outcome. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and a fair compromise considering Bob's previous counteroffer. 
* **Closing the deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale and secure a profitable deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, potentially causing me to lose time and potentially sell to John for a lower price. 
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $9,000 is a fair middle ground considering both our initial offers.
* **Securing the profit:**  Selling at this price ensures a substantial profit for me."
