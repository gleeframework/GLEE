"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,000? That would be a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
