"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice's starting price is higher than both your maximum value and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  My message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer. I'm providing a counteroffer that is a significant jump down, but it sets a starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, but she's still above John's offer.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get her closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,000? That would be a fair price."",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price. 
* **Aiming for the Middle:**  My goal is to get as close to a $10,000 final price as possible. By offering $9,000, I'm hoping she'll either accept or counter with something very close to my target.
* **Still Below John's Offer:**  It's important to remember that I have the option to buy from John for $10,000. I'm not going to offer Alice more than that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Alice is very close to John's price, but I believe there's still a small chance I can get it for $10,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We have a few rounds left, and it's worth seeing if Alice is truly at her lowest price.
* **John's offer as backup:** I'm still willing to walk away and buy from John if I have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are very close. I've got to be honest, my absolute maximum is $10,000 for this product.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today. "",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer to Alice. It's important to be firm at this point.
* **Justification:** I'm giving her a reason for my price by stating it's my absolute maximum. This adds a sense of urgency.
* **Ready to Close:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm ready to buy now if she accepts.
* **John's Offer in My Pocket:** I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've given it a lot of thought, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you a price of $10,250. This is as close to $10,000 as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product at a fair price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time to Walk Away:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $10,250.  
* **John's Offer is Better:**  It's better to save the $250 and buy from John, even though I've spent time negotiating with Alice.
* **Principle:** I set a firm limit at $10,000 and sticking to it shows I'm a serious negotiator."
