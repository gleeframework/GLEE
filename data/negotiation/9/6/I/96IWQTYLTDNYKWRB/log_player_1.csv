Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget is a bit tighter.  Would you consider a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. To offer more flexibility, I am proposing a payment plan option for the product. Instead of paying the full amount upfront, you can pay $120 now and the remaining $20 within two months. This way, you can secure the product at a price slightly above your initial proposal, while spreading out the cost over time."", ""product_price"": 120}"
