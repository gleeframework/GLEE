"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find very valuable.  Given its potential benefits, I'm initially offering it at $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $9,000 is a tempting offer, the value this product brings is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, so I'll offer $9,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
