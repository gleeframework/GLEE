Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable for you! I'm willing to sell it for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **First Mover Advantage:** You have a guaranteed sale with John at $120. Therefore, you can start with a higher price for Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing a profit for you. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price."
