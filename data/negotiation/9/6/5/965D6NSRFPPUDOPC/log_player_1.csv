(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision. Bob has made a decent offer, but it's still below my desired price range. However, with only two rounds left, there is a significant risk of getting stuck at a lower price or even failing to reach an agreement at all.

Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, securing a sale at this point is a wise move to ensure I don't lose out entirely."
