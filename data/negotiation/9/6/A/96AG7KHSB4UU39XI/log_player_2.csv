"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $950,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will still cost you $1,000,000, but you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If you accept Alice's offer, you'll save $50,000. It's better to try to negotiate a better price with Alice than to accept her current offer."
