Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already gone quite low, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and my original offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. It's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $13,000 and you've already stated your firm budget is $12,000. John provides a guaranteed option at your target price."
