Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're getting close! However, I was hoping to get a bit more out of this deal. I can do $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a great price for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.

It's time to switch to John.  Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500 and we have a standing offer from John for $12,000."
