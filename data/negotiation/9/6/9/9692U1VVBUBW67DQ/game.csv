"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am currently working within a budget and am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but this is my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to meet this price, otherwise I'll need to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
