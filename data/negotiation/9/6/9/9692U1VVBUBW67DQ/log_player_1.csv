Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal for both of us. I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,300,000 is a price point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:** By starting at $1,300,000, I aim to secure a higher price. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response.
* **Back-up plan:** The threat of selling to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am currently working within a budget and am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup option with John. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but this is my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to meet this price, otherwise I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Finality:**  Stating that this is my ""final offer"" adds pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Alternative options:**  I subtly remind Bob that I have other options (John), making him aware of the potential consequences of rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,225,000. This is the highest amount I can afford at this time. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While negotiating further might be possible, I've already made significant concessions.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price."
