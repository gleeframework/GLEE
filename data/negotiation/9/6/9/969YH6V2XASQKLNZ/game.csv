"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $7,000. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about we aim for a middle ground at $8,500 for the product? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the product more accessible to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. To continue moving forward, I propose a price of $8,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value it provides and your budget constraints.",8250.0,Alice,5,
