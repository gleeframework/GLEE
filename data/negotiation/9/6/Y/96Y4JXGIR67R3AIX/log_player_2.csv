"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Bob should start with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within a range he feels is reasonable.  $12,000 represents a substantial discount from $20,000, giving Alice room to negotiate while still being beneficial to Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's still potential to get a better price, and Bob can always choose to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

Bob should increase his counteroffer to $14,000.  This is closer to his maximum budget of $15,000 and might be more appealing to Alice while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $16,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate one more time.  Bob can always choose to buy from John if the next round doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

Bob should offer Alice his absolute maximum price of $15,000. This is a final attempt to reach a deal before turning to John as a backup.  If Alice doesn't accept, Bob can proceed to buy from John for the same price without further negotiation."
