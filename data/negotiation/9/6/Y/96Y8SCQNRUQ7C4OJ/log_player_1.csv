This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum price of $800,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is more than John's offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I still think $900,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
