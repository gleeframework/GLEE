"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. That's a good deal for both of us, so let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for that yet.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 just isn't working for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
