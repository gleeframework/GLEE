"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. That's a good deal for both of us, so let's see if we can make this work!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 just isn't working for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
