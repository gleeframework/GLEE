"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
