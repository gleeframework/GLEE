"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000. Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,
