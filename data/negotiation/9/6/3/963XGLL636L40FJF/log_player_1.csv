{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This gives us room to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows that he's still interested. I can counteroffer and try to get a better price.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I can use John's offer of $12,000 as leverage during the negotiation with Bob, reminding him that I have another buyer willing to pay more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $10,000 to $9,500.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that even at $9,500, he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price point. I believe there's still potential to reach a better deal for me.
* **John as a Safety Net:** While I want to get the best price possible, John's offer of $12,000 gives me a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob stalls, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the offer of $9,000.  I'm still a bit away from my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you the product for $9,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Leverage:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, but I'm also using the fact that Bob is getting closer to my desired price to push for a slightly higher number.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm framing the $9,250 price as a ""fair"" compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Keep the Negotiation Moving:** I'm asking for a clear decision from Bob to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a more significant reduction. I'm willing to offer $8,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,750 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, it seems like we're at an impasse.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, ensuring that I won't lose money on this sale.
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation with Bob might be time-consuming and may not ultimately result in a significantly better price. It's wiser to accept John's offer and move on."
