"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, as it's worth more to you than the asking price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price of $100 but also leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is still higher than my minimum price of $100, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a profit in this round."
