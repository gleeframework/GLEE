"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations or personal endeavors. Given its high value and potential impact, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $12,000 to someone like you who can truly appreciate and utilize its capabilities. However, considering your unique needs and benefits you'll derive from it, I propose we negotiate a price that reflects its true worth to you. Would you be open to discussing a mutually beneficial price that lies between $8,000 and $12,000? I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
