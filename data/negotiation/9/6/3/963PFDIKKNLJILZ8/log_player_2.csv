"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's fair considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  Since Bob has 10 rounds, there's time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, there's still room to negotiate.  He's still within his budget and has multiple rounds left.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price considering what I'm looking for and what you need to make. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,875? This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to close this quickly.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer, and he's only a few hundred dollars above his ideal price.  Accepting this offer allows him to close the deal quickly and save money."
