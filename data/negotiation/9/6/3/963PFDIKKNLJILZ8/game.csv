"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground!",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price considering what I'm looking for and what you need to make. Let's close this deal!",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,875? This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to close this quickly.  Let's make this happen!",10875.0,Alice,5,
