"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll try to find a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $15,000, which is my minimum.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, but also willing to compromise. I'm reiterating the value of the product to him to remind him that $15,000 is still a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not able to go above $12,000. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired $15,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference. How about $13,500?  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm proposing a compromise at $13,500, which is halfway between Bob's last offer and my minimum price. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. I'm also reminding him of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $13,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $15,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 isn't quite there yet. How about $13,250? It's a small increase, but it gets us closer to a deal. We're both invested in finding a solution that works for both of us, and I'm confident this price is fair for the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher counteroffer of $13,250. This demonstrates my willingness to continue negotiating while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. By emphasizing our shared goal of finding a solution, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I am willing to consider $13,125 for the product. I hope this offer allows us to move forward with a fair transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000. 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, the negotiation is taking longer than expected, and there's a risk that we won't reach a deal within the 10 rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation. I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future if this product becomes available again."
