"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves some room for profit, but it also reflects the true value of this product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
