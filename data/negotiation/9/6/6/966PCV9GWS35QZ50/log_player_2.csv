"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment, but I also want to make sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my preferred price, I'm still not at my ideal point. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,200,000 before potentially accepting."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1300000. How about we compromise at $1350000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer of $1,500,000. This is within my budget, and while I'd prefer to pay less, it's likely that further negotiation will just lead to more back and forth.  I'm happy to accept this offer and secure the product."
