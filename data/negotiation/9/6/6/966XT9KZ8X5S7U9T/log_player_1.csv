Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,350,000 allows room for negotiation while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to shift Bob's focus from the price to the potential benefits, making the offer more appealing. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a reasonable deal."
