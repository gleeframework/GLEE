"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $110. We're confident you'll find its value exceeds this price, but we're open to negotiation. Looking forward to your response!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While I see the value, $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Let's try $105.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $107? This still allows us to earn more than our initial asking price while remaining competitive. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $107 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $102.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",102.0,Bob,4,
