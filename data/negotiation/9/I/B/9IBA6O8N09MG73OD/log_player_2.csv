{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $600,000 is a great price, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get it even lower. 
* I want to gauge Alice's motivation to sell and potentially push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's initial price.
* This aggressive approach tests the waters and shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, it will give me a better understanding of her lower limit and allow me to adjust my strategy for the following rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price, indicating she's willing to negotiate. 
* However, $500,000 is still too high for me. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* It's early in the process, and there's still plenty of room for compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 475000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $475,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to accept her last offer.
*  I'm hoping to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This strategy aims to demonstrate flexibility and increase the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* If Alice rejects this offer, I'll reassess my strategy for the next round, possibly considering a more substantial increase to my counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still slightly above what I'm comfortable with.
* I believe I can still push for a lower price by continuing to negotiate. 
* I'm not in a rush, and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with a few more rounds of counteroffers.
* I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept Alice's offer at this stage."

{""product_price"": 500000}

* This offer shows I'm serious about buying and that I'm open to a reasonable price. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, I'll reassess my strategy for the next round, potentially adjusting my counteroffer or considering the offer from John."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* Alice's offer is only $50,000 higher than my last counteroffer, and I'm confident I can't push for a much lower price.
* I'm still saving a significant amount of money compared to John's offer, and it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.
* It's better to accept the offer now and secure the product rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
