I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is more than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
