"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is only $1 more than John's price, Bob should reject it. There's a chance he can negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially saving that extra dollar."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,200,000. Bob's goal is to save money, and John is offering a better deal at this point.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, as there's no guarantee she'll come down further."
