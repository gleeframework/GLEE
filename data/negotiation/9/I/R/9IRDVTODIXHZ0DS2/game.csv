,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $14,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",15500.0,Bob,4,
