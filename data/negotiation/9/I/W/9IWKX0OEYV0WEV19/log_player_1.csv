Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a good starting point. It's a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but still leaves room for negotiation or a counter-offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I aim to find a price that works for both of us while maximizing my potential profit."
