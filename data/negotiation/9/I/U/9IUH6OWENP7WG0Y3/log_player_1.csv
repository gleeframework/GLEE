{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also shows that I'm confident in the value of the product and am willing to start with a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower than $12,000 to encourage further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $9800? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting close to my initial offer of $10,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, accepting this offer ensures a good profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer of $8,000."
