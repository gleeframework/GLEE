"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It makes sense to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate the offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1200000, which is a significant discount from the initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above your budget. While it's a step in the right direction, it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still beyond my price point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This will allow us to finalize the deal and avoid further back-and-forth negotiations."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate Bob's willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $900000 is enough to cover the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I can offer you a price of $1100000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,100,000 is still more than you're willing to pay.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant move for me, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's reach a deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate Bob's flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still too high for your budget.  You've shown your willingness to negotiate, and it's worth seeing if you can push her down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there! While I appreciate your coming down in price, $1,050,000 is still outside of my comfortable range.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $975,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that both of us can be happy with. Let's make a deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to try to reach a deal. I can offer you a price of $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

With only one round remaining, it's not likely you'll be able to get Alice to agree to a price you're comfortable with. It's better to secure the product from John at a price within your budget."
