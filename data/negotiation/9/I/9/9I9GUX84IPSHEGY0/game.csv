"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000. Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $600,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is as low as I can go without losing too much profit.",650000.0,Alice,5,
