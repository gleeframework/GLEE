Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We understand your position and are willing to meet you halfway. Our counteroffer is $900,000. We believe this price respects both the value you place on the product and our business interests. We look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we've reached a price of $900,000.  This represents a $600,000 savings from John's offer and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks a worse outcome (Alice increasing her price or reaching an impasse) and might not yield a significantly better deal."
