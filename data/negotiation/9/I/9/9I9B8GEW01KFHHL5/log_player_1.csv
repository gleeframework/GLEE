Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my ideal price. $100 is still a good deal for me, but I'm hoping I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a bit more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to hold out for a bit longer to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence!  I'm willing to go down to $108. This is a fair compromise for both of us.  I hope you'll consider it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and higher than what John is offering.  It's also becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further."
