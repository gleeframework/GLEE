"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am only able to offer $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the  $2,300,000 price reflects the true value and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is my best offer, as anything lower wouldn't be worth it for me. Let me know what you think.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
