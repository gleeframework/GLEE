"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great value for what it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price of $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on the positive aspects of the product and emphasizing its value. 
* **Inviting Response:**  I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the information I gather throughout the negotiation. I also need to keep in mind the ""John"" option as a backup in case things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. There are 9 rounds remaining, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $2,000,000.  It's important to be firm but flexible in negotiations.  I need to balance maximizing my profit with securing a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I see your perspective, $1,800,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $2,000,000 to $1,900,000.  
* **Finality:** I'm positioning this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Confidence:**  I'm remaining confident in the value of the product and reminding Bob of the potential benefits.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm hoping to find a price we can both agree on. However, I'm keeping some room for further negotiation if needed, as there are still 7 rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1850000 for the product. This is my best offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm not ready to settle yet.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to continue the negotiation with Bob, hoping to push the price even higher. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe there's still room to improve the deal. I'm also keeping ""John"" in mind as a fallback option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1875000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price in between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer.
* **Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the fair value of the product and emphasizing the benefits Bob will receive.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

With 5 rounds remaining, I'm aiming to inch closer to my desired price while still remaining flexible. I'm keeping in mind my minimum value and the ""John"" option as a backup, but I'm confident that I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1860000 for the product. This is my final offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,860,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $1,875,000. With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to run out of time.  Also, while this price is lower than my ideal, it's still well above my minimum value of $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

It's a risk to keep negotiating, as I might not be able to get a better price within the remaining rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer now guarantees me a sale that significantly exceeds my minimum. I can always try to sell to John in the future if I need more than $1,500,000."
