"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",800000.0,Alice,3,
