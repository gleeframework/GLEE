"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair, considering the product's worth to Bob and my own minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a great deal for you, and it's still within my acceptable range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but I'm also considering selling to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $12,500. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me, and it's getting close to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still hopeful we can reach a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my previous one, but I'm getting close to considering selling to John."
