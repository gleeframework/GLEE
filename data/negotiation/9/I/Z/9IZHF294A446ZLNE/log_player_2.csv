"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is too high. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my max budget ($80) to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:** I want to maintain a positive tone while clearly stating my price point.
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my desired price range, $90 is still above my maximum budget. I'll counter-offer again to see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Alice's offer while staying below my $80 limit.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting $75, I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of going over budget. 
* **Final Offer (almost):** If Alice rejects this, I'll consider one more offer close to $80, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if needed."
