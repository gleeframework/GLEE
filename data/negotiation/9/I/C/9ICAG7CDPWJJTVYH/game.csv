"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  To get the ball rolling, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I think that's a fair starting point considering its potential worth to you.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe my initial offer was already quite generous.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,375,000 is the right price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference once more and settle on $1,350,000? This would be my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit off from my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to be sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you meet me at this price or is this the final offer?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
