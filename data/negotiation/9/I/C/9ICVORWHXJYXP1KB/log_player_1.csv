{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer, but I also have the option of selling to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have the option of selling to John for $150, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference?  $145 would be fair to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $145 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John.  It's not the highest price I could potentially get, but it's a sure thing."
