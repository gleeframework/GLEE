"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you! Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? ",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $87.50 is still a little low for me.  Let's try $89.  That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",89.0,Alice,5,
