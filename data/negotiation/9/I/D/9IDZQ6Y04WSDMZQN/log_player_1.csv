Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer needs to be significantly higher than John's $12,000 to ensure Alice maximizes her profit.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
