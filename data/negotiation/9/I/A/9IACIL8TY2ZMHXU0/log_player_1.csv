"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive and friendly message sets the stage for a good negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will give me a sense of Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can get a higher price than $85 if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $110 to $95, showing flexibility.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90. If we can agree on that, we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $100.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and get closer to my desired price.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I want to maximize my chances of getting the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $92? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Finality:**  I'm suggesting that this could be the final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Moderate Pressure:** The ""What do you say?"" phrase adds a slight pressure to get Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $92 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $91?  It's closer to my budget, and we can both be happy with the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $91 is only $1 away from my minimum acceptable price of $90.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I continue to reject offers, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might end up having to sell to John at $100, which would be less profitable."
