"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $145.",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand $175 was a bit high, but $145 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $160?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $155, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",155.0,Bob,4,
