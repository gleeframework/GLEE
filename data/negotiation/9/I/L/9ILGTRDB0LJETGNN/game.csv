"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do better than $8,500, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still make a decent profit.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $9,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for a product worth $15,000 to you, and I think we can both be happy with it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
