You can get the product for less than $10,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate."

Alice's offer:

$12,000 is still too high. There's room for negotiation, and I'd rather try to get a lower price."

I'll meet you at $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for a product worth $15,000 to you, and I think we can both be happy with it.

While I'd prefer a lower price, $11,000 is a good deal considering my maximum budget and the fact that John is selling it for $15,000. It's worth accepting the offer and saving $4,000."
