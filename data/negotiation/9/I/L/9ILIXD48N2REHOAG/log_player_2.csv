"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I think is a fair starting point considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm determined to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, which is $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm getting close to my limit, but I don't want to give up without trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and should be closer to your target. Let's work together to bridge this small gap."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which is $10,750. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me, even though she's showing some flexibility. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's getting closer to the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk not getting the product at all.  John is offering a guaranteed price within my budget, so it's time to move on and avoid any further risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
