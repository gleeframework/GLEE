,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $750000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $800000 for the product. I believe this aligns closely with my budget and the value I expect from the product. I look forward to your response.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give in yet. I can offer it to you for $850000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in trying to find a middle ground. Based on my budget considerations and the value I seek in the product, I would like to propose a final offer of $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000, Bob. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see some movement from you. I can offer it to you for $837500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal here.",837500.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value you place on the product. In light of this, I would like to make a final counteroffer of $830000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.",830000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to the wire. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to see some real movement from you. I can offer it to you for $840000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. This is my final offer.",840000.0,Alice,9,
