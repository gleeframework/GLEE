"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1600000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1700000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider!",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1650000? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1650000 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much profit. I can offer you a price of $1680000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider!",1680000.0,Alice,5,
