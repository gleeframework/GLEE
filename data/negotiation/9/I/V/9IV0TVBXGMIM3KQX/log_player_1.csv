"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to see if we can reach an agreement. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but $14,000 is still below it. I'm not ready to sell at this price yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my goal.  I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still not quite there yet. I can go down to $15,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value I'm offering. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiations with Bob have reached a point where the offers are getting increasingly closer to my minimum price, but still below it.  I've already had to compromise significantly, and the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that we might not reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. It's now more likely that I'll end up selling to John for $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. To avoid the risk of a lower price with Bob, I'll sell to John now and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
