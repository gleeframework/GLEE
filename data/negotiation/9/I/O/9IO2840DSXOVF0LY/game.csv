"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  Would you consider something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're willing to make some concessions, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
