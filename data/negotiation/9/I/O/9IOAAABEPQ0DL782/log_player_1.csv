{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still leaving room for negotiation and potentially earning more than your minimum.
* **It shows good faith:** You're not starting the negotiation with a ridiculously high price, making it more likely Bob will be open to a deal. 

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's reaction.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. This is my best offer based on my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

You should send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between his offer of $1,050,000 and your initial offer of $1,100,000.  This shows you're willing to compromise while still working towards your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $1,075,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meet in the middle:** This counteroffer is right in between your previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is polite and constructive, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Still above your minimum:** $1,075,000 is still above your minimum of $1,200,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and am willing to consider your latest offer. However, I am unable to agree to $1,075,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,062,500. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,062,500 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that meets your requirements.  

**Why selling to John is the best option:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** John is offering your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you meet your financial goal.
* **Time efficiency:**  Further negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and unproductive.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of Bob ultimately rejecting your offer. 

While you would ideally earn more, selling to John at this point is the most sensible decision to secure your desired outcome."
