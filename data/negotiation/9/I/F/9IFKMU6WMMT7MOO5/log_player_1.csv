{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $150, so you have room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and confident offer:** This helps set the tone for a positive negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is still above my minimum, I think I can get a better price. Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  Let's see if I can convince him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and a good starting point for us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$105 is a good price. It's above my minimum of $80 and close to Bob's last offer.  It's better than selling to John for $80, and it seems like Bob is serious about buying.  Let's close this deal!"
