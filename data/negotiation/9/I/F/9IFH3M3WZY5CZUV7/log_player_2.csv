"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. My starting price is $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still too high, and he has 10 rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still more than he wants to pay.  He has several rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives him the chance to get a better price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a final price that's beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000, which is a significant compromise. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  I'm confident this offer will be acceptable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
