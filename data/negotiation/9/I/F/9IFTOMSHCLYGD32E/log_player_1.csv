Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that works for both of us.  If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's more than my minimum. I hope this counteroffer is appealing enough to Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $100, which is my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $100."
