Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $10,000, there's no reason for Alice to sell it to Bob for less.
* **Strong Starting Point:** By starting at $10,000, Alice establishes a firm position. While it's higher than Bob's valuation, it leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is really interested. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice prioritizes maximizing her profit. There could be other scenarios where a slightly lower price might be strategically advantageous, but with the information provided, aiming for the highest guaranteed return is the most logical approach."
