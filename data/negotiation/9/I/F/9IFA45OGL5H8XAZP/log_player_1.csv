Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering the product at $100, which is above my minimum price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and engaging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob without explicitly revealing his perceived worth ($120). 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm aware that he values the product at $120, and I want to leverage that information to potentially secure a price closer to my ideal price point.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which reflects the value of the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a price of $90, which is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify my counter offer. This reminds Bob of the product's worth and may encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair price that benefits both of us. This helps create a positive and mutually beneficial negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my ideal price of $90, and significantly better than my minimum acceptable price of $80. At this point, further negotiation may not yield much more profit, and the risk of Bob walking away completely is high.  Accepting his offer allows me to secure a good price while avoiding potential loss."
