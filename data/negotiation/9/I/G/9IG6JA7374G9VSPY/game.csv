"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $85 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50. What do you think?",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $82.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $82.50 is just too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again at $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth it.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $83.75. That's the best I can do. Can you accept that?",83.75,Bob,6,
