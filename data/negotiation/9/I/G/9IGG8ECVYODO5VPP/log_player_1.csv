"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $100. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the benefits for both of us. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message implies I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $120, so I'm not desperate to accept it.
* **Room for improvement:** I can likely get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **Avoiding John:**  While $120 is my guaranteed minimum, I want to see if I can do better with Bob.  The negotiation is still early, and I haven't exhausted all options with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $100 for the product. How about $98? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a position above my minimum.
* **Strong justification:**  My message emphasizes fairness and a win-win outcome, making it less likely Bob will reject my counteroffer.
* **Staying above minimum:** This counteroffer keeps me above my minimum price point while giving Bob a chance to accept a deal closer to his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to offer $96 for the product. This price is still within my budget and allows me to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $120, so I'm not desperate to accept it. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We are getting closer with each round, and I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding John (for now):**  While $120 is a guaranteed sale, I'm enjoying the negotiation process and believe I can get a better price with Bob.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.  This is a fair price for both of us and it allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 97}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise and get closer to Bob's offer. This increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Closing the deal:** Emphasizing a quick close puts pressure on Bob to accept before he loses the opportunity.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  While I'm coming down, I'm still above my minimum and within a reasonable range of my desired price."
