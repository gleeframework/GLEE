It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for a lower price than $100 from John, so it makes sense to try and get a better deal from Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer of $87 is a good deal. It's lower than what John is offering and still leaves some room for profit for Alice."
