"I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about we settle on $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
