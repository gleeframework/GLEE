{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to you, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a decent price for Bob, considering he values the product at $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's counteroffer and see if I can get him to move closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about we settle on $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000,  $9,250 is a reasonable compromise. It's still a profitable deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely by being too stubborn.  Accepting this offer allows me to move forward with the sale and avoid potential further negotiation."
