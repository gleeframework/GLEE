Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value exceeds Bob's perceived value by mentioning a ""worthwhile investment.""
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to find a price that is agreeable to both of you while maximizing your profit."
