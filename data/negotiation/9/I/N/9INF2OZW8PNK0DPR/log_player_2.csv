"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum budget.  

By rejecting, Bob can start the counter-offer process and potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There's still room for Alice to lower her price further."
