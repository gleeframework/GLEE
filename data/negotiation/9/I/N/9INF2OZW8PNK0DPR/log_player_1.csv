Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This allows for some room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. If Bob rejects this, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, or I can choose to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth less to me than it is to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. I believe it's a good opportunity for us to strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still maintaining a price above Bob's initial offer but below my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal without resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable threshold. The negotiation process is taking time, and I want to secure the best possible price. Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I get my desired price and avoids further delays with Bob."
