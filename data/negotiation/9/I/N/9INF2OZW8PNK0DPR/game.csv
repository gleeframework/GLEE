"Alice,  $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth less to me than it is to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. I believe it's a good opportunity for us to strike a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
