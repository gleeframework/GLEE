Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves Bob with a potential $1,000 gain, making it more enticing than refusing and letting you sell it to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you start high, you leave a small margin for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, still keeping you well above your minimum."
