Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,000,000. I'll try to counter with a lower price than my original offer, but still above Bob's offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $1,000,000. This still leaves me with some savings while allowing us to reach an agreement.

```

While I would love to get more, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. We've been going back and forth, and I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might become less willing to negotiate. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a lower price or even losing the sale."
