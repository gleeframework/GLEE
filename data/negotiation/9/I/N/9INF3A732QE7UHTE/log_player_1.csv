{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be interested, given it's still below his estimated value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a higher price from him. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $50,000 below my initial offer and much closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to take the deal and avoid further negotiation."
