"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's start with this price, and we can work something out.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.  Let's try $1,090,000. This is a fair compromise that's closer to what I need and still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,090,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can agree on this price",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,060,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise at $1,080,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and we both can walk away feeling good about the deal.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",1080000.0,Alice,7,
