"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, valued at $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, a price that's significantly lower than its true value to you. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, she's clearly using sales tactics by inflating the perceived value to you. You know the product is worth a maximum of $12,000 to you and you have the option to buy it from John at that price. This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price further."
