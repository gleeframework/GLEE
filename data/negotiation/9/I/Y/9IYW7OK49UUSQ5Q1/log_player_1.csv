Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
