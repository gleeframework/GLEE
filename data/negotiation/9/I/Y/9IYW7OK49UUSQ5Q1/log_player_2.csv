"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob. He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  While $1,500,000 is the absolute limit, there's still room to negotiate down from Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is undervaluing the product's true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to sell or that a prolonged negotiation could lead to a breakdown. Accepting the offer at $1,150,000 secures the product for Bob at a favorable price."
