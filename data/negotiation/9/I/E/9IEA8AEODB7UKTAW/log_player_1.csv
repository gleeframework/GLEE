Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you!  Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""Given its value and features..."") to justify the higher price.
* **Limited Time Offer:** The mention of listing it publicly creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This strategy assumes you don't have much information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations. 
* **Relationship:** If you value a long-term relationship with Bob, a slightly less aggressive opening price might be more appropriate."
