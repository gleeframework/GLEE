"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product could greatly benefit you and I'm happy to discuss a deal. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to aim for the best possible outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Anchoring:** This initial high price sets a strong anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value during the negotiation. 

I'm balancing my desire for maximum profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially accepting John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price and am willing to engage in further negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident that this product can bring you even more value than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000?"",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Targeting the Zone of Possible Agreement:** This counter-offer falls within the range where both our valuations overlap, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. Considering the value proposition and my financial constraints, I would like to counter with a price of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards my price range, but I still see potential for a higher offer. While $1,080,000 is a decent profit, I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can potentially secure a price closer to $1,100,000.  I'll continue to make strategic concessions while demonstrating the product's value to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer shows I'm willing to be slightly flexible, but I'm also standing firm on a price that represents a significant profit for me.
* **Highlighting Value:** By emphasizing the product's benefits to Bob's business, I'm reiterating its value and justifying the price.
* **Approaching the Limit:**  We're getting closer to the point where I may have to consider John's offer to minimize the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the ongoing negotiations, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  While I believe I could potentially get a slightly higher price, the difference is becoming increasingly marginal. Accepting now provides a guaranteed, substantial profit without the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Extended negotiations can be tiring for both parties. Accepting at this point shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal and value his time.
* **Strong Profit:** $1,075,000 is a very good offer, exceeding my minimum acceptable price by a significant amount. It's a win-win situation for both parties."
