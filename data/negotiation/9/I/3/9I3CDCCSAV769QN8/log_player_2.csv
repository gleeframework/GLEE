"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose specific details without a signed NDA, I can assure you its worth is significantly greater than $800,000.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential benefit to you. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer who is prepared to pay $800,000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
