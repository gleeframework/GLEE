Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

``` 
 
 While $1,400,000 is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to my target price. Bob's ""final offer"" language suggests he's getting close to his limit, but there might be a bit more room for negotiation.  Let's see if I can push him a bit further in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Since you're serious about the purchase, I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's settle this at $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
``` 

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Meeting in the middle:** This price splits the difference between Bob's ""final"" offer and my previous price. 
* **Sense of urgency and finality:** By stating it's my final concession, I'm adding weight to the offer and encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Still above the backup offer:** $1,550,000 is still a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000."
