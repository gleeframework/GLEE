"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I've done some research and I believe the market value of this product is lower than what you're asking. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'm thinking of a price around $11000. It's still a great deal considering the product's unique features. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $11000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get closer to my target. How about $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10500. I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing a price of $11750. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",10000.0,Bob,6,
