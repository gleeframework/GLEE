"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is a reasonable starting point that acknowledges Alice's value but also aims to get closer to my target price.  It's a middle ground that leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is still above my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice as I have 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $107. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise. It also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is my absolute maximum.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price. John is offering the product at my maximum price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to secure the product before potentially losing out completely."
