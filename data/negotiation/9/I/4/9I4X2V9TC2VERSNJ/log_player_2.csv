# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly what the product is worth to you. There's no benefit in accepting, as you can buy the same product from John at the same price. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
