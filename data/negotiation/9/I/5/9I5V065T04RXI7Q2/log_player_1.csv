"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open. I'm setting a high initial price, but it's not an unreasonable starting point given my minimum value. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  Accepting this offer would be a big loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob is clearly trying to get a bargain, he is still expressing interest in the product. This means there's a possibility for a mutually acceptable deal if we continue negotiating.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:**  If I'm not able to reach a better deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for $100. This is a guaranteed profit and my fallback option.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground while still protecting my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This still gives you a good deal considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial $110 but still well above Bob's $60.
* **Maintaining a Profit:** $90 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $100, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Positive Language:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the counteroffer as a good deal for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also protects my financial interests. I'm hoping to reach an agreement with Bob in this round, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. Accepting this offer would mean losing money on the product.
* **John is a Safe Alternative:**  I have a guaranteed $100 profit by selling to John, so there's no urgency to accept a deal that's below my minimum.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob is clearly still interested, and he's willing to negotiate. This suggests that there's potential for him to raise his offer further. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While selling to John is a safe option, I'm not willing to settle for a loss just yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap while remaining above my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $75 is still a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a further compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* **Fair Price:** I'm framing $85 as a fair price for both of us, emphasizing that it's a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining Profit:** Even at $85, I'll still be making a profit on the product, which is important. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while staying within my acceptable range. I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob in this round, as time is ticking and selling to John is always an option if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to go up a little bit, how about $78? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $78 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. Accepting this offer would mean losing money on the product.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $100 is a safe and profitable option, ensuring I don't lose money.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of not reaching a deal and losing out on potential profit is too high.  John provides a guaranteed profit, and the remaining rounds are not worth the gamble."
