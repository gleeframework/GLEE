{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, trying to motivate him to accept.
* This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiation range without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range. This allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a higher price without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but this is my final offer. It's still a significant discount from my initial price, and it allows you to acquire a valuable product for a competitive price.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $950,000, which is still below my minimum but significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Final offer:** I'm trying to create urgency and pressure Bob to accept. 
* **Value proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to close the deal. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while keeping my potential profit close to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm ready to pay $900,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  This is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to potentially secure a better deal.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him higher. It's possible that he might be willing to compromise a little more to secure the product.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By continuing to negotiate, I can demonstrate my commitment to getting the best possible price for my product. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
