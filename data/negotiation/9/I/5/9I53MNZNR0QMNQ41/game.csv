"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but this is my final offer. It's still a significant discount from my initial price, and it allows you to acquire a valuable product for a competitive price.  Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm ready to pay $900,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  This is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal and make it happen. This is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
