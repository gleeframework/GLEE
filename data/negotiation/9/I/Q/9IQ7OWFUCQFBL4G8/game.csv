"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8500. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to explore other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make a profit, and $8500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a good price, and I think you'll find it reasonable.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I need to stay within my limit. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to another seller.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already gone down to $11000, and now I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $9500. I'm counteroffering at $10250. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it reasonable.",10250.0,Alice,7,
