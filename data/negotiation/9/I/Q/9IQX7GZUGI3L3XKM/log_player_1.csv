"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see some flexibility on your end. I'm thinking of a price around $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a good deal, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. There are still 8 rounds remaining."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it shows my commitment to working with you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm confident that's a fair price for a product that's worth $1000000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand his perspective, $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to let go of this product for less than $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest in this product and I'm still eager to work with you. However, $850,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000.  This is a significant concession, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to see a bit more flexibility. How about $925000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $925,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still a bit too low. I'm confident I can push for a better deal with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle just yet. There are still four rounds remaining, and John's offer is always an option if things don't work out with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. Let's settle at $937,500. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 937500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $937500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to see a bit more flexibility. How about $920000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob refusing to budge much further, I'm going to sell the product to John. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of ending up with a lower price than John's offer is too high."
