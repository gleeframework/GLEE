Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's still a good price considering the value it holds for me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $10,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly higher than what I would get from John. It's worth taking this deal to secure a good profit."
