"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $9000. How about $8750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be at $9250. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
