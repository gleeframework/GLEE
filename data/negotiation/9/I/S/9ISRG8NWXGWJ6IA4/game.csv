"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and quality.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this work and believe this price is fair.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
