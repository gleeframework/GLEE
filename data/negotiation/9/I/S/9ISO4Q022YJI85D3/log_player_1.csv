Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to accept $7,500 for the product?  I'm really interested in buying it, and I think this price is fair considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
