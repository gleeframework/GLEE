"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice is offering the product at exactly that price, there's no immediate advantage to accepting.  There's a possibility Alice might be willing to lower the price, so it's worth exploring that by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal. $10,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, making it a strong starting point for negotiation. This aggressive approach might incentivize Alice to consider lowering her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired range.  There's still room for negotiation, and by rejecting, Bob can continue to try and push for a lower price. He's already shown his willingness to walk away, which might pressure Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now moving closer to Alice's offer. A counteroffer of $11,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to save some money. This is a reasonable offer that might be accepted by Alice, but if not, it puts pressure on her to come closer to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal range.  There are only five rounds left, so the pressure is increasing to reach a deal. However, Bob is confident he can negotiate further and secure a better price.  He's shown his willingness to be persistent, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to make one final concession to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push, increasing his offer to $11,500. This is a compromise, showing that he's willing to meet Alice halfway. With only four rounds remaining, it's a calculated risk. If Alice rejects this offer, there's a strong chance she'll accept a counteroffer at $11,800 in the next round, as he's already shown a willingness to go that high.  The pressure is on Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price, making it clear that she's not willing to budge further. Bob has already made significant concessions and is getting close to his limit.  With only three rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  Buying from John for $12,000 is the most sensible decision at this point.  This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice."
