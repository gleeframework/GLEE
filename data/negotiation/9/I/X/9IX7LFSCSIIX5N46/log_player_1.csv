Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Testing the waters:** Offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value lets you gauge his eagerness and potential for a higher sale.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's high value without being overly specific.  The phrase ""fair price"" aims to frame the negotiation as mutually beneficial.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Ideal scenario, you maximize your profit.
* **Bob negotiates:**  This opens the door to find a price between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 that benefits both parties.
* **Bob rejects:** You move on to John, securing your minimum desired profit."
