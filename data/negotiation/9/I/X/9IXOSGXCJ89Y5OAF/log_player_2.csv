Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's start with $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. This is my best offer for now.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit too far apart.  Let's try $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is within my budget, and it seems like she's firm on this price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might walk away, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
