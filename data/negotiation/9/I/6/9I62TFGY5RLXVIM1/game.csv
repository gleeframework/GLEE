"Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your valuation of it, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a valuable asset.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still unable to meet the price of $19,000. I would like to propose a price of $17,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your commitment to finding a price that works. Let's settle this: $18,000.  That's a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it's a very fair deal for such a valuable item.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to counter with a price of $17,500. This is a compromise that I believe respects both our positions while staying within my budget constraints.",17500.0,Bob,6,
