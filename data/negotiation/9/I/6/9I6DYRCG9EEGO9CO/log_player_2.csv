"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $10,000 to me, but I understand its value to you is around $8,000. Considering this, I would like to offer it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point of $8,000. You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, so it's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
