"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $130, so it makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $115? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can still get a better price than $122. You are willing to pay up to $150, so you can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $122 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $118.  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 118}
