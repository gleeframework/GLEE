"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's not, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'll still keep my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Bob, as it's a good compromise between his initial offer and my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for him to accept, but I'm also ready to potentially lower it further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. It's a compromise between Bob's last offer and my minimum, and I'm hoping it will be enough to close the deal.  We're getting close to the end of our negotiations, so I need to be strategic about my counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with $16,000, but I'm running out of time.  I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price, hoping to push Bob a little bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a bit higher than Bob's last offer, but I'm willing to take it if he won't budge any further. If he rejects this, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is it. It's down to the wire. While Bob's offer of $15,500 is tempting, it's still not what I was hoping for. I've had a good negotiation with Bob, but it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  It's better to guarantee a profit of $500 than risk getting nothing if Bob refuses my final counteroffer."
