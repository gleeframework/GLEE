"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $14,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the benefits it will bring to your business.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $14,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is halfway between our last offers. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. If we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",15000.0,Bob,6,
