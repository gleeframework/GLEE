"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as high as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9750. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counter-offer of $9,750 is still lower than my ideal price, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. There's still a gap, and I believe I can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which is closer to our middle ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $9,800 is still within my budget and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer.  While I would prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely and having to pay the full $12,000 to John.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
