Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality item, but I'm not sure if $110 is the best value for me. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go down to $90.
