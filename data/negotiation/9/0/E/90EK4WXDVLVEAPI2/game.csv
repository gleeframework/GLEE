"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1000000, considering I've done some research and found similar products in the market for lower prices.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your research, I believe my product offers unique [highlight key features] that distinguish it from those you've found.  Taking that into account, I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll receive.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that your product has some unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $920000. I'd like to see if we can meet at a mutually agreeable price.",920000.0,Bob,4,
