Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  I believe it's a fair price given its unique value and potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this offer:

* **High starting point:** This sets a strong initial expectation and gives you room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable justification:**  Providing a reason for the price helps Bob understand your perspective.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message shows willingness to discuss the price, indicating you're not inflexible.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's potential budget:**  You don't know Bob's budget, so you need to be prepared to negotiate.
* **Product uniqueness:** The more unique the product, the higher the potential price you can ask for.
* **Your risk tolerance:** If you're willing to risk a longer negotiation, you can start higher. If you want a quick deal, you might start lower.

Let me know how Bob responds, and we can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffers!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1000000, considering I've done some research and found similar products in the market for lower prices. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:**  While $900,000 is less than your initial offer, it's still higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives you room to negotiate further.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested in the product and may be willing to pay more if you push a bit further.  
* **Negotiation strategy:**  By rejecting his offer, you maintain control of the negotiation and can explore whether you can get closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired amount. Consider the following:

* **Counteroffer amount:**  A reasonable counteroffer might be $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Counteroffer message:**  Acknowledge Bob's research but reiterate the unique value of your product. You could say something like: ""I appreciate your research, Bob. While other products might seem similar, mine offers unique [highlight key features] which justify a slightly higher price.""

Let me know what Bob's response is, and we can adjust the strategy accordingly!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your research, I believe my product offers unique [highlight key features] that distinguish it from those you've found.  Taking that into account, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll receive.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer amount:**  $950,000 is a middle ground between your initial offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's research but emphasizes the unique value of your product. It also highlights your willingness to compromise while still maintaining a fair price.
* **Open to discussion:** The message ends by asking for Bob's thoughts, inviting him to continue the negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. By acknowledging Bob's research but emphasizing the unique aspects of your product, you try to address his concerns while maintaining your stance on the value proposition. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that your product has some unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $920000. I'd like to see if we can meet at a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** $920,000 is significantly closer to your desired price than John's offer of $800,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise by meeting you halfway. Further negotiation may risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on, potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal.

**Conclusion:**

While $920,000 isn't your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that allows you to secure a sale at a price significantly higher than your minimum. Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and secures a good outcome for you."
