"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth it for me to sell at that price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000, which is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his estimated value. This shows good faith and allows for potential negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider a fair price. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. It's not worth it for me to sell to him at this price, and John's offer is still on the table as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to make a small counteroffer, dropping the price slightly to $1,150,000.  This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While this offer is still slightly below my minimum, we are now very close to a deal. It's important to consider the time pressure of the 10 rounds. If I continue to reject his offers, I risk running out of time and being forced to sell to John.  While I could make a counteroffer, there is a chance he will reject it and we could continue to be stuck in this pattern.  Given the risk of running out of time and his increasing offer, it's more strategically sound to accept Bob's offer."
