# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to immediately accept. You have no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
