"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,300,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While $1,300,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to make this deal work. This price still allows me to achieve a satisfactory return, and it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
