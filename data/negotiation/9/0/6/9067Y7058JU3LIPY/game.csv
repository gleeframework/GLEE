"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, reflecting its value to me. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your seriousness in making a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement at this point.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This would be a fair price, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",925000.0,Alice,5,
