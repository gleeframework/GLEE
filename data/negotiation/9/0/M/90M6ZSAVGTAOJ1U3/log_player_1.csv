"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $140 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but also ensuring I get a profit. 
* **Positive message:**  I want to build rapport and show I'm confident in the value of the product. 
* **Open ended:** The message invites Bob to engage and gives him a reason to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My goal is to maximize profit:** $130 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob has shown interest, but is willing to pay less. I can likely get closer to my target price with more negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If the negotiation doesn't go my way, I have a guaranteed $150 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $130 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $135? I believe it's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still holding out for a higher price.
* **Middle ground:** $135 is a good compromise that shows flexibility without dropping below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I want to maintain a good relationship with Bob while getting closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $135. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $132.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and getting closer to my target price.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  By rejecting this offer, I can hopefully push him further towards my preferred price. 
* **John is a backup:** If the negotiations fall apart, I can still sell to John for $150."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that.  Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to come down to $133.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 133.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:**  I'm showing flexibility by meeting him halfway between my previous offer and his last offer. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that this is still a good deal for Bob, even though I'm coming down in price.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness, hoping he'll see the value in closing the deal at this price. 
* **Staying close to my minimum:** $133.50 is only slightly below my minimum price, but it's a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $133.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $131.25? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're at round 6, and I'm getting closer to the point where it's not worth risking another rejected offer.
* **Value of John's offer:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.
* **Negotiation is not guaranteed:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my next counteroffer, even if I make a small concession. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, the risk of another rejected offer is too high at this point.  John's offer is a secure way to close the deal and ensure I don't lose out on potential profits."
