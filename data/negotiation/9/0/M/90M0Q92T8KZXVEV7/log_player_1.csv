"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than even my own valuation, I aim to set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm fully aware this initial price is unlikely to be accepted. However, it provides ample room for me to negotiate down throughout the rounds while still aiming for a price well above Bob's perceived value.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John in the background willing to pay $1,500,000 ensures I have a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is far too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which was expected. While I could take the safe $1,500,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll aim to bring him closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's quality and potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession of $200,000 to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and move towards a deal.
* **Still Above Target:** This counteroffer keeps me well above both Bob's valuation and my minimum acceptable price, leaving space for further negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's try to bridge this gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob has increased his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above John's Offer:** While Bob's offer is now above John's $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than my target.
* **More Rounds:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to try and negotiate a higher price.  I'll make another counteroffer, but be prepared to consider accepting if Bob makes a substantial jump in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However,  $1,400,000 still falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I aim to add weight to the negotiation and potentially nudge Bob closer to acceptance.
* **Meeting Halfway:** While not literally halfway, this offer creates the perception of significant compromise and fairness. 
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to apply a bit more pressure to reach a deal. If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round or two, I'll likely accept his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. To make this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and reflects my genuine desire to acquire this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches what I can get from John.
* **Diminishing Returns:** It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and further negotiation might risk losing him entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further rounds and secures a strong profit. 

While I could push for slightly more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,500,000 represents a good balance of risk and reward at this stage."
