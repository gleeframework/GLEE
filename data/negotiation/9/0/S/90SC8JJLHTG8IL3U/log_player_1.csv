Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $110. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum, and the negotiation seems to be settling at a price that's still good for me.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $105."
