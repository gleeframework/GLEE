```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $8,000, which is the maximum you're willing to spend.  Since John is also willing to sell it to you for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John, but you'll still get the product for the same price."
