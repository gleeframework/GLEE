Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects or counter-offers, you can adjust your strategy accordingly. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your negotiation with Bob."
