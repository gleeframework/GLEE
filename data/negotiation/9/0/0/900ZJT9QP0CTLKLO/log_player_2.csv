"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,300,000 is within your budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price. 
* **Time is on your side:** You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the product's value to you, I'd like to propose a starting price of $950,000. This represents a significant discount, while still allowing you a substantial profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product, and its potential for your business, justifies a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would allow me to feel comfortable with the deal while still offering you a substantial discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $1,125,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but it's still higher than the product's value to you. 
* **More room for negotiation:** You can continue negotiating and aim for a price closer to your ideal range, likely somewhere between $950,000 and $1,125,000. 
* **Time is still on your side:** You have several rounds remaining to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, $1,125,000 is still quite a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's compromise further. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This represents a fair middle ground that allows us both to achieve our goals. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
