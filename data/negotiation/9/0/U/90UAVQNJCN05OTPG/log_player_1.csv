This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $10000 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than selling to John, I'd prefer to try and negotiate a higher price."
