"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for only $100. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored just for you, considering its high value to you at $120. Don't miss out on this exceptional deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer of $100 is less than your maximum of $120, you know you have a backup option with John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John for $120."
