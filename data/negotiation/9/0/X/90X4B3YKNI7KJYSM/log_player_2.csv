"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's definitely worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to signal that I'm serious about buying the product but won't go any higher.  Alice will either accept this offer, or we can start a negotiation process where I gradually increase my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to continue negotiating, especially since I have several rounds left.  I'll try to counter with a higher offer, but I'm not going to go much higher than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's last offer.  It shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but also emphasizes that I'm not going to dramatically exceed my initial budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, but it's getting closer. With only 5 rounds left, it's worth continuing the negotiation.  I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,300,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but keeping the price within a range I'm comfortable with.  With less than half of the rounds left, it's important to start closing the gap."
