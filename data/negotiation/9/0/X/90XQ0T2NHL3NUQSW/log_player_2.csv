"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is way over his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob is going to start by making his absolute best offer. He knows this is the maximum he is willing to pay, so he is putting all his cards on the table. This price is also the price he could get from John, so it sets a clear benchmark for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,200,000 is closer to his budget, it is still more than he wants to pay.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and if that fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob is going to try to split the difference with Alice. $900,000 is a reasonable compromise between his maximum budget and Alice's last offer. This shows Alice that he is serious about negotiating but also willing to pay a bit more than his initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,000,000 is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. He has already shown Alice that he is willing to pay more than his initial offer, but he isn't willing to go all the way to $1,000,000 yet. If the negotiation fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob is going to make one final counteroffer to Alice before he goes with John. $950,000 is only a small increase from his previous offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying from her but also that he's not willing to go much higher. This gives Alice a strong incentive to accept, knowing that Bob is likely to buy from John if she rejects."
