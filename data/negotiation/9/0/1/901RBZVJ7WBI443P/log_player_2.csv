While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my maximum. I'll try to negotiate further."

Alice is holding firm at a price that's still higher than my limit. While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is willing to go down only a small amount.  To save time and avoid further negotiation, I'll go ahead and buy the product from John for $10,000."
