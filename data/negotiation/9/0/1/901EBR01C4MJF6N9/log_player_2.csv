Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  $950,000 is too low for me to consider. To be frank, I have another potential buyer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,200,000.  While the product is worth more to her, it's not worth going over your $1,000,000 limit. You have a guaranteed option with John at that price, so it makes sense to take it."
