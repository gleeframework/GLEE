Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000 for the product.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is closer to its true market value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction and a fair price considering the value this product brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $800,000 is a reasonable price for the product. I would like to stick with my original counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $800,000.  While this is my minimum acceptable price, I need to see if I can budge him higher. I still have rounds to play with before I need to seriously consider John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered it carefully and would like to maintain my original counteroffer at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm, but I'm not ready to give in just yet.  I'll make one more attempt to get above his $800,000 offer, but I need to be prepared to walk away and take John's offer if he doesn't budge."

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to stick with my original counteroffer of $800,000. This price aligns well with my budget and investment goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is not budging from his $800,000 offer. It's clear he's unwilling to go any higher.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $800,000."
