Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. 
* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile, as John will pay that. 
* **Negotiation:**  By offering $1,400,000, I'm leaving room for potential negotiation while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.  

This approach attempts to maximize my profit while also leaving room for Bob to potentially accept a deal that is still beneficial to him."
