# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you, given its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground there.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
