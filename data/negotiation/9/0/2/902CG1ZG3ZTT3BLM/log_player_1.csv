"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer of $120 meets my minimum, I know John is ready to buy at that price. There's no point in risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum."
