{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You are willing to sell for no less than $15,000, so you still have some margin.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By starting with a strong but flexible offer, you increase the chances of reaching a deal while also maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While you could accept and walk away with a quick sale, it's not a good deal for you.  

You have two better options:

1. **Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a more favorable price, potentially closer to your desired price point.
2. **Sell to John:** If you feel Bob is unlikely to budge, you can always sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000.

The best strategy is to try and negotiate with Bob further, but be prepared to walk away if the deal doesn't meet your minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer represents a significant compromise from your initial $14,000 offer, showing you're open to negotiation.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $13,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing you to make a profit.
* **Attractive to Bob:** This price is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, making it more likely that he'll accept.

This counteroffer creates a balance between maximizing your profit and making a deal that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price point, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. You have two better options:

1. **Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to send another counteroffer, potentially pushing the price closer to your desired amount. You could offer a price slightly above $12,750, but still below your minimum, to show you're willing to negotiate.

2. **Sell to John:** If you feel Bob is unlikely to budge much further, you can always sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000. This is a safe option to ensure you get your minimum price.

Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations or selling to John are the better strategies at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to compromise,  $12,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** This offer represents a small compromise from your previous offer of $13,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $13,250 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring you profit.
* **Midpoint:** This offer is the exact midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, creating a sense of fairness and potentially encouraging Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually agreeable price while still ensuring you receive a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go down to $12,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet your minimum requirements.  

Negotiations have reached a stalemate, and further counteroffers are unlikely to yield a significant price increase. It's more beneficial to sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000, ensuring you receive your desired profit and avoid further time and effort spent negotiating with Bob."
