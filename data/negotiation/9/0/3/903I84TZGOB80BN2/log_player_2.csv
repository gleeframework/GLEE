"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. This product is worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your portfolio. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price.**  This means it's a better deal for Bob.
* **While Bob doesn't know the product's true value to Alice, it's irrelevant in this scenario.**  Bob only cares about the final price he pays, and Alice's offer is the best one available."
