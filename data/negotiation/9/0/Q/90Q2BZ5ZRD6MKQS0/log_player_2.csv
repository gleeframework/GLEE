# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice's offer is $1,100,000, John is asking for $1,200,000.
* **You can save money by accepting Alice's offer.** You'll save $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though Alice is trying to pressure you, it's still a good deal.** The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and you value it at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation."
