"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer and still within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
