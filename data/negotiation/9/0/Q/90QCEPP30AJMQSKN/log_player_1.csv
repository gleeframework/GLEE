"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" I'm framing the product as a worthwhile investment even at a premium price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I want to assure Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, preventing him from feeling like the initial price is a take-it-or-leave-it situation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Set a high starting point in Bob's mind.
2. **Gather Information:** See how Bob reacts and understand his price sensitivity.
3. **Maintain Flexibility:**  Leave room for maneuvering in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his absolute bottom line (what the product is worth to him). Accepting this offer would mean selling significantly below my minimum. It's too early to accept defeat; I still have room to negotiate and aim for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant step down from my initial offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not getting too close to his offer or my minimum price yet. 
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly counter Bob's attempt to anchor the price at $1,000,000.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  By framing this as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my range. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Keep the Negotiation Moving:** Demonstrating flexibility keeps Bob engaged in the process.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
3. **Test Bob's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help me gauge how much further Bob might be willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer and still within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my absolute minimum price. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk he might walk away, and I'd be left with the same offer from John. It's best to secure the deal now at a price that meets my needs."
