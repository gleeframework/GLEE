"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a game-changer in its field and I believe it could significantly benefit your operations or personal endeavors. Given its value to you, which I estimate to be $15,000, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its market value of $15,000 and offers you an exceptional opportunity to acquire it. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details about the product. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price. 

**Remember:** You have John as a backup option at $15,000, so you don't risk losing the product entirely by negotiating with Alice."
