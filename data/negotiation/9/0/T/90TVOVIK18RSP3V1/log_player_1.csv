Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a good value for Bob since it's less than the product's worth to him.
* **The message is friendly and persuasive:** It highlights the value proposition for Bob and encourages him to accept. 

**Important considerations:**

* This is just the first offer, and you'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. 
* If Bob rejects, you'll need to decide whether to counter-offer or sell to John. 
* Keep in mind your goal is to maximize your profit, but also be willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate fairly."
