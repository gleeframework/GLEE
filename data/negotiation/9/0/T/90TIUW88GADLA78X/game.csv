"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $107.50.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $107.50 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $108.50? It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",108.5,Alice,5,
