Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows for negotiation and the potential to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) while still surpassing your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** An initial high price signals that you value the product and are open to discussion. It gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, leading to a potentially mutually agreeable price.
* **Guaranteed Backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. If he rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time for negotiation. If you need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more practical."
