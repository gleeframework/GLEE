"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've indicated you value it at $800,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and more expensive than buying from John. You can get a better deal by rejecting her offer and going with John."
