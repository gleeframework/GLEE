"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I really like the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. I'll sell the product to you for $15000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I've made a serious offer of $13000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think about buying from John for $8000, so I'd like you to reconsider and meet me at $13000",13000.0,Bob,6,
