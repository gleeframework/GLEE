"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but to be honest, my budget for this is really closer to $9,000. If you're able to do something around there, I'm ready to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,800. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
