"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that's truly worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but $900,000 is still a significant cost. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice values the product at $800,000, meaning there's a potential for a price that benefits both parties.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offering.**  You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer and engaging in further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and $875,000 is significantly less than that.
* **Alice is willing to negotiate.**  She has already lowered her price from $900,000 to $875,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  Buying from John for $1,000,000 would cost you significantly more than accepting Alice's offer.

While you could try to negotiate further, the current offer is reasonable and saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
