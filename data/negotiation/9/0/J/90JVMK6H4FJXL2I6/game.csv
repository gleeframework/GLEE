"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value, $8,500 is still a touch more than I was hoping to spend. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the lowest price I can go, considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Alice,5,
