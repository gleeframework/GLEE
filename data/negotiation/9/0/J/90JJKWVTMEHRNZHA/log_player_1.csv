Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still considerably above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll get.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not being too aggressive with my initial offer, anticipating that Bob might counteroffer.

This approach balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation and potentially reach a deal.  If Bob rejects, I can then assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great price for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while holding firm on my minimum value.
* **Attractive price:** $120 is still a good deal for Bob, especially considering his valuation of $80.
* **Finality:**  I'm signaling that this is a reasonable offer and I'm not willing to go much lower.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining my goal of maximizing profit. If Bob rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price further.  I've already made concessions, and continuing to negotiate risks losing time and ultimately ending up with a lower price than I could get from John.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, and it's the most sensible decision at this point."
