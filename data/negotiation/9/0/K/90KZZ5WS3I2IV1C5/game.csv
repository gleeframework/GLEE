"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
