Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so offering it above that price creates a potential profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer guarantees you'll get at least $150. Therefore, any price above that from Bob is a bonus. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and securing a sale above your minimum acceptable price."
