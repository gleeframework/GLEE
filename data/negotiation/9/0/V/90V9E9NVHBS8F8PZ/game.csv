"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its value.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good price for you given its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering what the product is worth to me.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's value. My next offer is $10,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",10000.0,Alice,5,
