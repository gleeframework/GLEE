``` 
Reason:While Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,200?"",
""product_price"": 8200
}
``` 

Reason: I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). This leaves room for further negotiation while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to make a deal, $8,200 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,800?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
