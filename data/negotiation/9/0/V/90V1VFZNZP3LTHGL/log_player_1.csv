Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise. It's lower than your floor price of $15,000, but still higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000). This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's willingness to pay and the guaranteed $15,000 offer from John."
