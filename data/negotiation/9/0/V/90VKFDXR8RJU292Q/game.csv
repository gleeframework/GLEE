"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1100000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1250000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to be more aggressive. I'm thinking of making a lower offer, $1150000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to make a significant purchase.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to be more aggressive, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1150000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1300000, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think you're not serious about selling this product to me. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'm going to go even lower. I'll meet you at $1200000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
