"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I know could greatly benefit you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and am confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have my limits. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you, which is why I initially proposed a higher figure. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to see a price that makes sense for my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a figure that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, $1,500,000 is the very lowest I can go while still honoring the value of what I'm offering. I believe this product can bring you a substantial return on your investment, exceeding the $1,000,000 value you mentioned earlier.  Are you open to reconsidering your offer?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
