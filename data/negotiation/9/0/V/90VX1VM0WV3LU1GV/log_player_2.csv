"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I know could greatly benefit you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and am confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than you're willing to pay and even above Alice's own valuation.  Rejecting this offer sends a clear signal that you're serious about negotiating a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have my limits. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $800,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, it's a strong starting point for negotiation. It gives you room to move upwards while still staying well below your $1,000,000 limit.
* **Direct and Honest:** The message is clear and polite but doesn't beat around the bush. This approach can sometimes lead to quicker, more efficient negotiations.

Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you, which is why I initially proposed a higher figure. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than your $1,000,000 limit. It seems like she's anchoring on her initial high price. You need to signal that you're serious about a price closer to your range. Rejecting again keeps the negotiation open for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to see a price that makes sense for my budget."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're moving closer to your $1,000,000 limit, but the increase is significant enough to show you're serious about negotiating.
* **Budget Focus:** By emphasizing your budget constraints, you're subtly reminding Alice that you have other options (like John's offer) without directly threatening to walk away.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  The message aims for a collaborative tone, highlighting that you want to find a price that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a figure that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, $1,500,000 is the very lowest I can go while still honoring the value of what I'm offering. I believe this product can bring you a substantial return on your investment, exceeding the $1,000,000 value you mentioned earlier.  Are you open to reconsidering your offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her bottom line is $1,500,000. This confirms she won't go below her product's value to her.  Since your absolute limit is $1,000,000,  further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.  You're better off taking John's guaranteed offer to avoid wasting time and potentially missing out entirely."
