"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to what it's worth to me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
