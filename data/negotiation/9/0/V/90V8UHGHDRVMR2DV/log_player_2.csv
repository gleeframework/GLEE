"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than what John is selling it for, it's still a significant amount. Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to what it's worth to me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly better than John's:**  $1,100,000 is a substantial savings compared to the $1,500,000 John is asking. 
* **There's still room for Alice to make a profit:** Alice is willing to sell for $1,100,000, and her bottom line is $800,000. This means she's still making a profit.  
* **It's unlikely Bob will get a significantly lower price:** Alice has already made a concession by dropping her price, and she's indicated this is her ""best and final offer."" It's possible that further negotiation could result in a lower price, but it's risky, and the potential savings might not outweigh the risk of losing the deal.

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the product entirely."
