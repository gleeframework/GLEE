"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial price of $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. To demonstrate my interest, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the product's potential value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value of this product significantly exceeds $1,200,000. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still significantly above my comfort zone. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1,500,000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise.  I'm eager to move forward with this purchase, but this is the absolute maximum I can offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
