"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $14,000. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $15,500. It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
