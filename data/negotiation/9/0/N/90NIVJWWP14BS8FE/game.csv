"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's make this happen! ",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",92.5,Alice,5,
