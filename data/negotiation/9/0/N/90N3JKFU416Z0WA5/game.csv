"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $750000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1200000?  This still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  While $900000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference. How about $1050000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this will be a successful investment for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
