{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $120, but I'm also willing to negotiate to secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $105 is too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $108? I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum price of $120. I'm not ready to sell at this price, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
