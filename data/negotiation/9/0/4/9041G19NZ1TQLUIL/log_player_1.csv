{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we start the conversation at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would still allow me to recover a significant portion of the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and land at $962,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However, $962,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's keep moving towards a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is a significant concession.  This would allow me to meet my minimum while still offering you a good deal, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
