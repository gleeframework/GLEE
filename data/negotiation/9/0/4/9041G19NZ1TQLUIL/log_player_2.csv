Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would still allow me to recover a significant portion of the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However, $962,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's keep moving towards a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is a significant concession.  This would allow me to meet my minimum while still offering you a good deal, considering the product's value to you.
