"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we start the conversation at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would still allow me to recover a significant portion of the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and land at $962,500?",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However, $962,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's keep moving towards a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is a significant concession.  This would allow me to meet my minimum while still offering you a good deal, considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
