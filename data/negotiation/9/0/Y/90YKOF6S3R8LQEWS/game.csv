"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,450,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I place on this product. I'm offering $1,550,000. This price is within the range of what I can afford, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
