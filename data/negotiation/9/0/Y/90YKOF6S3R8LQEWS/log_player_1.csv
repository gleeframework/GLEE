Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I place on this product.
