I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe this initial offer allows for negotiation room while still aiming for a profitable sale.  I'll be paying close attention to Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm eager to sell, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower than my minimum acceptable price to encourage negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm countering with $15,000. This is still a good profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation. Hopefully, Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a stalemate or me accepting John's offer.  It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
