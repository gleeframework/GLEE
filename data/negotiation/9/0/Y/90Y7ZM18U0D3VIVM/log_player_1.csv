Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you something I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to get a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely justifies the high price by mentioning ""its worth,""  which could be interpreted as its worth to you or its potential worth to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's negotiation style or how much he's willing to pay above his perceived value."
