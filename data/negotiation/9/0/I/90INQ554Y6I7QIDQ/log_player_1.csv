"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit lower than my minimum value of $150, but it gives me room to negotiate while still making a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above the $80 value he places on the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'm not willing to sell at that price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $110 is a good deal for you, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $120. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $115. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, and I appreciate the effort.  $115 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $118.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 118}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $118. I'm willing to go up to $116, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob aren't progressing as quickly as I'd hoped. While $116 is close to my minimum value, it's still below my target and we're running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a guaranteed sale with John."
