{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher final price.
* **Positive and friendly:** The message is positive and friendly, aiming to build a good rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to increase his interest and willingness to pay. 

**Next Steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response and then decide whether to accept a counteroffer, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000,  it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer of $12,000, considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering your interest in the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, showing respect and building rapport.
* **Justifying my counteroffer:** I explain my reasoning for rejecting his offer, highlighting the value of the product and my desire to get closer to my initial price.
* **Compromising:** I'm making a compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.

**Next Steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer and then decide whether to accept, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,500 is closer to my desired price point than selling to John for $8,000.  While it's still a bit lower than my ideal, I'm willing to accept it at this point to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed with the sale to Bob for $10,500."
