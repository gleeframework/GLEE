"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1150000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still a little too high for my budget at $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and I offer $1,100,000?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I can offer the product to you for $1,125,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1125000.0,Alice,5,,
