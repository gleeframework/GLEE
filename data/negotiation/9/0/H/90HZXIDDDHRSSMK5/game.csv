I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $15000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think?,15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $10500.  This is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product at $13500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my minimum price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $11500, which is closer to my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
