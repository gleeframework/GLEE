"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16,500. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above Bob's budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  John is a safe option, but Bob can still potentially save money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering it to you for $16,750. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $16,750 is still above Bob's budget.  While there is still room for negotiation, it is becoming increasingly likely that Alice will not budge further.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it is more prudent for Bob to secure the product at a known price from John, rather than risk continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the product."
