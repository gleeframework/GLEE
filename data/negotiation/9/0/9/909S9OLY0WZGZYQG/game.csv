"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let me know if you're open to discussing that price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
