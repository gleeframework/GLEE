Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let me know if you're open to discussing that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
