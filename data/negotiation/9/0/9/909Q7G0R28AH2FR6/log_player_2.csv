You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always better to try to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to lower the price.  There's no reason to buy from John at this point, as Alice's offer is the same."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a 10% discount. This is a significant offer, and it might be enough to get Alice to consider it. If she doesn't accept, I can adjust the price further in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is coming down in price, but I still have some room to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's offer. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm also willing to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get a better price, and I'm not yet desperate enough to buy from John.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, showing that I'm getting closer to her price but still want a bit more.  Hopefully, we can find a middle ground."
