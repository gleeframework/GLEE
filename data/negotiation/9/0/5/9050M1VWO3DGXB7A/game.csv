"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not comfortable going above $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference at $9,500?
