"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer. How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
