Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $100. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $100 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer. How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
