Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate. I'm also pricing it above my minimum acceptable price of $150, as I'd rather sell to John if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from the previous offer, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to what Bob might be willing to pay.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price."

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price that might be acceptable to Bob, considering his previous offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round."
