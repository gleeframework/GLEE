Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm willing to pay the maximum I'm comfortable with, which is $80.  Let's see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my budget. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm going to offer $90, which is a compromise between my maximum and Alice's last offer. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement at this price."

```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but it's still not quite there. I'm not confident we'll agree on a price lower than $80, so I'm going to buy the product from John. It's not ideal, but it saves me the hassle of further negotiations."
