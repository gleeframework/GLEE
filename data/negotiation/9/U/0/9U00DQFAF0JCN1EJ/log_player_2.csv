# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($1,350,000) is lower than John's price ($1,500,000), but it's still significantly higher than what Alice values the product at ($1,200,000). 
* By rejecting the offer, there's a chance Alice might come back with a lower price, getting you a better deal. 
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John at your maximum budget.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to incentivize Alice to offer a price closer to her valuation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
