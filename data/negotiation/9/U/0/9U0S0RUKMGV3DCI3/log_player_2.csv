# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth more to Alice, so she's likely to negotiate down. It's too expensive for Bob, so he'll reject and try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that is within both of our limits, and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, which is $10,000. I'm also considering the fact that I could sell the product to John for $10,000, so I'm willing to make this final compromise. Let's make a deal at $10,000! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has already negotiated down to $9,500 and Alice is unwilling to go lower.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation to save an extra $500.  Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000 and save even more."
