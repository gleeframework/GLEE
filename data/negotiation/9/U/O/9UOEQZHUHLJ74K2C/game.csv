,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you letting me know about the product. However, $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $90? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe $90 is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product and would be happy to pay $95. That would be a good compromise for us both.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I think $100 would be a fair price for both of us. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",100.0,Bob,6,
