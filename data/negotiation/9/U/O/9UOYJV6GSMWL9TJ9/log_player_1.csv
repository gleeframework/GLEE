Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm setting the price at $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message attempts to justify the high price by emphasizing the product's ""true worth and potential,"" subtly playing on Bob's knowledge of its value. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The price leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's possible he'll be willing to pay a premium to avoid losing the deal. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob is highly price-sensitive or unwilling to negotiate, he might reject the offer outright. However, given the information, aiming high initially offers the best chance to maximize profit."
