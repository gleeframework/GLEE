"While I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price.  Let's start with $8,500. This represents a fair value for me, and allows us to potentially close a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,500. How about we discuss $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high.  I'm ready to close the deal at $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a quick transaction.",8750.0,Bob,4,,
