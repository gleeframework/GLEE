Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:**  It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation, considering Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** It highlights the potential benefit for Bob and opens the conversation for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter with a new price, or end negotiations and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $12,000. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that bridges the gap and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the true value of the product for you. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and it ensures we both benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This strategy shows a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a price closer to my initial goal.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  The message highlights how the compromise is advantageous for both of us.
* **Clear and concise:** The message is straightforward, leaving no room for confusion about my intentions. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a better price than my initial offer.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to accept his counteroffer or sell to John."
