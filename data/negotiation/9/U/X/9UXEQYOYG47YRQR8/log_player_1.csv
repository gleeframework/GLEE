"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $175 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}

I'm counteroffering at $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $180 is a good price that's significantly higher than selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
