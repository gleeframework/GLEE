Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing it as a great deal and a good fit for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, giving me a chance to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's counteroffer indicates interest, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $120, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $70 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $85?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $100 to $85, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing it as a good price for both of us, emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of a price around $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and there's a risk of going back and forth with no real progress.
* **Time is valuable:**  Negotiating further might take time and energy, which could be better spent pursuing other potential buyers or focusing on other tasks. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

It's better to secure the guaranteed sale with John and avoid the risk of getting stuck in a protracted negotiation that might not yield a satisfactory outcome."
