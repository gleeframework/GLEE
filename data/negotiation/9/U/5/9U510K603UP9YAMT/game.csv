"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your product is worth $12,000 to you, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,500 as a counteroffer. I hope this proposal works for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still hesitant at $11,000, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,
