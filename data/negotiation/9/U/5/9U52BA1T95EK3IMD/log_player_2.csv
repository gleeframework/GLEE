"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's initial offer of $110 is still too high. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also want to get a better price than her initial offer. It's a compromise that hopefully allows for continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is very close to my target price of $120.  I've already rejected her offer at $105, demonstrating my desire for a good deal. Accepting at this point minimizes risk and saves time in the negotiation process. It's the best outcome given the current situation."
