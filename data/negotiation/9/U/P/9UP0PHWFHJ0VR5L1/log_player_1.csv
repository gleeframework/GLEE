I'm offering Bob the product for $1,800,000.  This gives me a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 while still leaving room for negotiation. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Higher starting point:**  Starting high encourages Bob to think about the value of the product and potentially negotiate down.
* **Room for compromise:**  The difference between my offer and John's offer gives me flexibility to negotiate if necessary. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance Bob values the product even higher than my minimum and may be willing to pay more."
