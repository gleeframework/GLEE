"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $175."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm counteroffering with $165. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $162. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $3 less than my counteroffer and significantly better than selling to John.  It's important to consider that we are already in round 4, and time is running out."
