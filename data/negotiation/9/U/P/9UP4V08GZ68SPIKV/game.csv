"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm happy to accept a price lower than my minimum of $12,000. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, and I'm offering you the product for $11,250. This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my own minimum. I hope you'll accept it. ",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $11,100 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on it.",11100.0,Bob,4,
