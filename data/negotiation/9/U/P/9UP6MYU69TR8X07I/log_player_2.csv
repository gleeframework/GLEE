Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $6,800 just doesn't work for me. Let's try $7,200.  It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $7,000 isn't quite enough for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,100.  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down, but in smaller increments now.  Waiting any longer may mean the price doesn't go down much further. $7,100 is a decent compromise and saves me $900 from John's offer."
