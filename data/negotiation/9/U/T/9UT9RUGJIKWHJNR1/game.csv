"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product to me.  If you're not willing to accept, I'm prepared to walk away and purchase from another vendor.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
