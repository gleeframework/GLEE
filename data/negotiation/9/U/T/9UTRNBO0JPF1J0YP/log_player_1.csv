{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer starts with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It allows for some room for negotiation but still leaves me in a good position to potentially earn a profit.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by mentioning the potential value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell the product for that low, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little to $95.  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I still believe I can get a better deal with some more negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  Let's split the difference - $92.50.  I'm confident you'll find this product extremely valuable, and at this price, it's a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
