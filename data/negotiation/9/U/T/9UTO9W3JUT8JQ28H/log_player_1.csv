"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is more than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal and below what I believe the product is worth. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,800 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still see great value in the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected two of my offers and continues to insist on a price lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've reached a point where it's clear that further negotiations with Bob won't yield a satisfactory result.  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is more than my minimum threshold. It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer."
