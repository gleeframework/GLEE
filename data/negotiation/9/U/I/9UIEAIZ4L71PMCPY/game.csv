"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $90 for you, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny!",90.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I can meet you halfway between $87 and $90, so I'm willing to do $88.5 for you. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great price for this amazing product!",88.5,Alice,5,
