Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefit it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I want a high price, starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **John as Backup:** I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't get less than $1,000,000, so I can be a bit bolder with Bob.

This strategy aims for a high initial offer, hoping Bob sees the value and accepts. If he negotiates, I have room to decrease while still making a significant profit."
