"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point to maximize my profit. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to negotiate further, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $8,500?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I think that's a fair price that lets us both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,100, but that's my final offer. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9100}
