This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which still leaves some room for us to find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $105 is the best price. I'm willing to go up to $102, but no higher. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:

While $102 is still slightly lower than my ideal, it's a fair compromise and close to my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation."
