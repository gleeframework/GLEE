"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which still leaves some room for us to find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?,100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $105 is the best price. I'm willing to go up to $102, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",102.0,Bob,6,
