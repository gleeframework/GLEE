"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you think the product is valuable, but not at $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $980,000 is closer, I'm afraid I'm reaching my limit. I could potentially do $925,000.  This is a strong offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $990,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",990000.0,Alice,7,
