Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you think the product is valuable, but not at $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $980,000 is closer, I'm afraid I'm reaching my limit. I could potentially do $925,000.  This is a strong offer, and I hope we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $990,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $990,000, and even if she did, the savings would be minimal. John offers a sure thing at $1,000,000."
