{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage.  

By starting high, you give yourself room to potentially negotiate down if Bob hesitates but still ensure a profit exceeding your minimum."
