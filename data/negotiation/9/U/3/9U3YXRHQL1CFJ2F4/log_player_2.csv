# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I can do $10,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my comfort zone. With only 5 rounds left, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a higher price.  It's better to go with John's guaranteed $8,000 offer."
