"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I can do $10,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this amazing product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
