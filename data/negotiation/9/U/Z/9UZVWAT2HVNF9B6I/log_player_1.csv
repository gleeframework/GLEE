Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire this product. While its value to me is significant, I recognize you might find it immensely beneficial as well. Considering its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob values the product even slightly above its worth to him ($800,000). He gets it for less than your guaranteed price, and you make a profit above your minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
