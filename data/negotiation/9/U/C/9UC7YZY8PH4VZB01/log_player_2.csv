"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's not worth it to accept her offer. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price or go with John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price of $10,000. It's still possible to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $14,000 is closer to my ideal price, but it's still higher than my budget. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I can still make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal. If it doesn't work, I can always fall back to John's offer of $10,000."
