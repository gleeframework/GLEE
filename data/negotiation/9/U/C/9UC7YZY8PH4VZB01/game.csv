"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $12000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $14000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $13000 for the product. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
