"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so I'm aiming for a price that's somewhere in between our valuations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get more. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a price that's above my minimum and closer to what I think the product is worth.  It's possible Bob is getting closer to his upper limit, so I'm trying to get him to accept before he walks away."
