{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for the highest possible profit, while still being within Bob's likely range. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's enough room for Bob to counteroffer without making you feel like you're giving away too much. 
* **It sets a strong starting point:** Showing confidence in your asking price can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer depending on Bob's response. You have the option to make a counteroffer, or to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still significantly lower than your desired profit margin. You're in a strong position as you have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You show Bob that you're not desperate for a sale and that you are willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Explore a higher counteroffer:** You can counter with a price closer to your initial asking price, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 

It's important to weigh the potential for a better deal with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,075,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, reminding him of the product's worth and the potential benefits. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The wording ""find a solution that works for both of us"" keeps the door open for further discussion and avoids creating an ultimatum.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining your leverage and maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now very close to your desired profit margin, and it's a significant improvement from his initial offer.  Given that you have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer secures a profit of $100,000. 

While you could continue negotiating, the potential gain is relatively small, and there's a risk that Bob could walk away entirely. It's a good time to lock in a solid deal and avoid further uncertainty."
