Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for your product. This aligns better with my valuation and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise.  This would still leave you a significant profit margin, and I believe it's a strong price point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the market conditions and our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,360,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price,  $1,360,000 is a good compromise that is above my minimum and still allows me to make a decent profit.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's lower offer."
