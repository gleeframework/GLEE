"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in your product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm ready to offer $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $8500 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $9500. I believe the value of this product warrants that price. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get $9500, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $9000. This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident this product is worth the investment.",9000.0,Bob,4,
