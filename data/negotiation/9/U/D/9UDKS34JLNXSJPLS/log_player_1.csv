{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. My starting price is $10,000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to give myself room to negotiate. I'm also trying to establish a positive tone and signal that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in your product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm ready to offer $8500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can get a better offer in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $8500 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $9500. I believe the value of this product warrants that price. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get $9500, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $9000. This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident this product is worth the investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
