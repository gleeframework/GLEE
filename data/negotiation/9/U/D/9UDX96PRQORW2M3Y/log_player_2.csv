"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than to her own valuation. I should counter-offer with a significantly lower price to see how much room for negotiation there is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to negotiation. Would you consider $8,750? It's a compromise that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but she's still aiming for a price much higher than her valuation. It seems there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose something a little higher than my previous one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $7,800? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the continued discussion. It seems we're getting closer.  I could be persuaded to let it go for $8,250.  Do you think that would work? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're making progress and Alice is slowly coming down. However, the price is still a bit too high for me. I'll counteroffer slightly below her current offer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! How about $8,000 even? That's a nice round number we can both feel good about."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
