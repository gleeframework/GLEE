Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values it less. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping he will come closer to my desired price. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't come up in the next round, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating further.  I'll sell the product to John for $10,000, as it's my minimum acceptable price and a guaranteed sale."
