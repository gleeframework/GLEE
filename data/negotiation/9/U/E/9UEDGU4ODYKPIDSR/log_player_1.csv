"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should give me a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and to gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of him backing out or me losing out to John."
