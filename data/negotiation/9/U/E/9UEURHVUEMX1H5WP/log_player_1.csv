Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is above his perceived value of $80 but still gives him some room to negotiate. It also allows me to make a profit while leaving some wiggle room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $90 is too low for me to accept. It's better to sell to John and guarantee a profit of $120, which meets my minimum acceptable price."
