Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum value.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it represents a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
