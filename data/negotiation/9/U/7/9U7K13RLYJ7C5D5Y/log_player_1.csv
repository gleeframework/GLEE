Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm happy to purchase the product for $1,250,000. This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it represents a good value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
