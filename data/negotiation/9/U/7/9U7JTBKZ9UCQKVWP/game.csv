"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to make a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $860,000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I believe the product's value is worth more than your last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",860000.0,Alice,5,
