"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but how about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  Let me know what you think.",87.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $91.25? I'm confident this is a fair price that will benefit us both.",91.25,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $91.25 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $89. Let's make a deal at that price and move on.",89.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but I'm still a bit away from $89.  Let's try $90.  That's a small step towards your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
