"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but also to understand that Bob might not be willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get a better offer. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to secure the sale and accept his offer."
