"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,250,000? This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product brings.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
