"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. Considering its quality and features, I'd like to propose a price of $120 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $60? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting its worth to me.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value I place on the product and aiming to find a middle ground, I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our respective valuations and could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial transaction.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $90 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $75? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. To further explore a fair transaction, I propose an offer of $85 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise considering both the product's value to us and your perceived worth of it. I hope this proposal is acceptable and moves us closer to closing the deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
