Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is designed to maximize my profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so $14,000 is a significant premium. This makes it less likely he'll accept, but still gives him a chance to get a deal.
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price:** My minimum price is $15,000, so even if Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed to get that amount from John.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is very interested, he might counteroffer at a price closer to $14,000, allowing me to earn more than my minimum.

This approach balances the risk of losing a sale with the potential for higher profit."
