Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. To further accommodate you, I am willing to consider $10,750 as the final price for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise, considering the value you place on it. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

While Alice has come down in price, $10,750 is still higher than your maximum price point of $10,000. It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John."
