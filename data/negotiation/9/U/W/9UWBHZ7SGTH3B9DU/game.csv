"I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? That would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
