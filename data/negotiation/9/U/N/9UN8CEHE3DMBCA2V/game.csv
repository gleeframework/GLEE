"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's potential, but I'm open to discussing a mutually agreeable price.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but based on my research and budget, I am not able to meet the price of $2000000. I am willing to pay up to $1500000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
