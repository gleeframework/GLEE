"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. It's a great price, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $12,800. It's a fair price, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,800 is a good deal for Bob.  It's below his maximum price of $15,000 and still saves him money compared to John's price.  There's a chance he could get a better deal by rejecting the offer, but the risk of losing the product to someone else isn't worth it."
