Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and constraints:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for the next 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has a safety net with John ($800,000), ensuring she won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, she might start slightly lower to avoid immediate rejection.
* **Product Uniqueness:** The more unique and valuable the product is to Bob, the more leverage Alice has to set a higher price."
