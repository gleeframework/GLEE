Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in exploring this opportunity further but need to start with a significantly lower price. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point for negotiation.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I'm very interested in this product, $1200000 is still outside of my budget.  Given the value I'm placing on this product and what I'm able to offer, I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.
