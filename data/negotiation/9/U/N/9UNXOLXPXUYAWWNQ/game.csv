"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in exploring this opportunity further but need to start with a significantly lower price. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price point that's more in line with the value I believe the product holds. How about $1200000? I'm open to further discussion, but I need to make sure we're on the same page regarding the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I'm very interested in this product, $1200000 is still outside of my budget.  Given the value I'm placing on this product and what I'm able to offer, I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $800000. However, I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $1200000, which would be $1000000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
