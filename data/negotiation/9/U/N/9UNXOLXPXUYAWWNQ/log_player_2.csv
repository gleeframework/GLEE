# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate but I won't accept that price.  I'll try to get her down closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in exploring this opportunity further but need to start with a significantly lower price. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price point that's more in line with the value I believe the product holds. How about $1200000? I'm open to further discussion, but I need to make sure we're on the same page regarding the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a significant drop from her initial price, it's still higher than my comfortable spending limit. I'm close to my limit, but I'm going to try and negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I'm very interested in this product, $1,200,000 is still outside of my budget.  Given the value I'm placing on this product and what I'm able to offer, I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $800000. However, I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $1200000, which would be $1000000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's, so I'm going to go with John. I have no reason to continue negotiating with Alice at this point, as the price is the same."
