"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? ",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to come down a bit, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  That way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,4,
