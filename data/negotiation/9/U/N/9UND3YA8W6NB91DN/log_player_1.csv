Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make it more appealing. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) at $15,000, so I have some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial offer of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. He's shown some willingness to move towards my price, and I can try to meet him halfway.
* **Backup Option:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at a much better price, so I don't need to rush into accepting Bob's offer. 

I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to come down a bit, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  That way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach a compromise.
* **Positive Language:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations moving forward.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value by suggesting a ""good deal"" for both of us.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  This offer is closer to my target price but still leaves some room for potential future negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob has moved closer to my price, we're still $4,250 apart. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation will likely involve more back-and-forth and may not lead to a significantly better outcome for me.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $15,000, which is a substantial profit compared to Bob's offers.

It's better to accept John's offer and avoid the potential risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not yield a desirable result."
