Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,080,000 is only $30,000 higher than my last offer.  At this point, the negotiation is getting close to a mutually agreeable price. Accepting this offer will save me $420,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small concessions."
