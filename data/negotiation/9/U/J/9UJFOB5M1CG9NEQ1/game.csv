"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  Let's try to find some common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is still a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
