Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $22,000 is too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is my maximum budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter offer.  While $22,000 is my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate to make this work.  How about we meet halfway at $18,500? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to push him a bit further to see if I can get closer to $17,000.  I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now for $17,250? That's me coming down significantly from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 17250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While I'd like to get more, Bob has been consistently moving up, and we're only $500 apart. It's better to secure the deal now at $15,500 than risk him walking away or continuing to negotiate for a smaller increase. The difference isn't worth potentially losing the sale altogether at this point."
