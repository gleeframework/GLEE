"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $15,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
