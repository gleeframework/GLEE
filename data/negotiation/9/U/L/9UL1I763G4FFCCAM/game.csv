"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This price is fair and reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
