"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  A high initial offer helps establish a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Flexibility:**  By not setting a hard ""bottom line"" in the message, I'm allowing for some negotiation space while still aiming for a high sale. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $500000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Necessary:** While Bob's counteroffer is far off, it indicates he's interested in the product. Rejecting it allows me to continue negotiation and potentially reach a more agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so I can afford to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500,000 is far too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which still reflects its true value.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is a Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob that this price is still fair.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counter again.
* **Protecting Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1750000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $750000 for this product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $750,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's a larger increase than before, it's not enough to make it a worthwhile deal. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I have several rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate and hopefully get a better price from Bob.
* **John as Backup:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000. This gives me the confidence to hold firm for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $750,000 is still not reflective of its true value. I'm prepared to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both sides."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a substantial decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a deal.  
* **Fair Value Argument:** I reinforce the product's value, implying that my offer is still fair despite the compromise. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, hoping to encourage Bob to reconsider his position.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While lower, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1250000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. I believe this demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's not yet at a point where I'd be willing to sell. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic and try to push for a better price.
* **John as Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, giving me the leverage to reject this offer and continue negotiating.
* **Potentially Bridge the Gap:** By continuing negotiations, I might be able to convince Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not enough to cover the value of this product.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,000,000 is another significant decrease, demonstrating flexibility while still protecting my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's value, hoping to justify my asking price.
* **Strong Call to Action:** The message ends with a strong call to action, expressing optimism and encouraging Bob to accept the offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to close the gap and secure a deal that's at least somewhat close to my minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is waiting to buy for $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for this product. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a way to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to our last two rounds, and it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is far better than accepting Bob's final offer.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price from Bob in the next round, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John ensures a safe and profitable outcome."
