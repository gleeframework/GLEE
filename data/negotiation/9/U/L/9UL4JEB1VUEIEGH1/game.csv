"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $500000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is far too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which still reflects its true value.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1750000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $750000 for this product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $750000 is still not reflective of its true value. I'm prepared to come down to $1250000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both sides.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1250000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. I believe this demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $850000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not enough to cover the value of this product.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for this product. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a way to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,8,
