{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it immediately at that price. I'm going to try to get closer to my original asking price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and close to my original asking price.  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
