Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
My goal is to earn as much money as I can.  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to propose $8,800 as my final offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go down to $9,200, but I can't go any lower. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll agree. "", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering our previous discussions, I would like to make one last offer of $8,900 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, we're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with less than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's a guaranteed sale at my desired price, and I don't want to gamble on getting a better offer from Bob."
