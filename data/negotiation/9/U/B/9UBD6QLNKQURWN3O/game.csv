"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 seems a little high for me. How about we settle around $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $120 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal! ",130.0,Alice,5,
