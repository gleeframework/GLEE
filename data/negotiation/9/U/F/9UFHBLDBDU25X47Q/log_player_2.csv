Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to settle at $100 yet. I can do $140, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

It's unlikely Alice will go down to $100.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price."
