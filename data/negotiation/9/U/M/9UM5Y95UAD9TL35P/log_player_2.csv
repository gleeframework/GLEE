"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. After careful consideration, I have decided to extend an offer to you for this item at a special price. I understand its value to you stands at $1200000, and I am confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.

I am offering the product to you for $1350000. This price reflects a fair compromise between its intrinsic value and my desire to ensure you receive a significant discount compared to the market rate. I believe this offer presents an excellent opportunity for both of us to achieve our respective goals.

Please let me know if you are interested in discussing this further. I am more than happy to provide additional details about the product and answer any questions you might have. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,
Alice
