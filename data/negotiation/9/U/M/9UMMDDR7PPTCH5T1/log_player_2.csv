"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price of $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the product's worth to me and still offers you a significant profit. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You can potentially get a better deal with Alice, or you can always fall back on buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This would still allow you a good profit margin while ensuring I don't have to sell at a huge loss. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget. While it's closer, it's still a risk to accept. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there's a chance Alice might come down to your desired price.  You can always buy from John as a backup."
