"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high. I'm interested in buying the product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This would still allow you a good profit margin while ensuring I don't have to sell at a huge loss. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but unfortunately, that's still a little higher than I can go.  I'm really hoping to secure this product for my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that final price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
