"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially suggesting $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a deal closer to his desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price and is now offering a price that is within Bob's budget. Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation could potentially get the price lower, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob may end up having to pay John's higher price.  Accepting the current offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
