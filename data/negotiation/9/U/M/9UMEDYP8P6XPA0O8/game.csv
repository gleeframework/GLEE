"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
