"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This is a fair price given my assessment of its value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident that $1,000,000 is a fair and realistic price given my assessment of the product's value.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
