"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $100. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than my minimum of $150, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140, which is halfway between my minimum of $150 and Bob's last offer of $120.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum of $150, but still a significant loss compared to John's offer of $150. However, we are already in round 4 and I only have 6 rounds left.  It's likely that I won't be able to negotiate a significantly higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob entirely.  So, I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
