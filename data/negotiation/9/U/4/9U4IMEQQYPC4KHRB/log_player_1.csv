Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your specific needs, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. 

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario (selling to Bob at a high price) while mitigating risk (John's guaranteed purchase)."
