Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still represents a substantial discount from my guaranteed selling price. 
* **Encouraging a Deal:** The friendly tone and emphasis on the ""deal"" aim to incentivize Bob to accept, even if it's slightly above his initial valuation.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than my guaranteed sale."
