"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is your limit, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $9,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while also leaving you with a substantial savings compared to what the product is worth to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet you halfway at $9,000. My maximum budget remains at $8,000. Could we possibly find a middle ground?",8500.0,Bob,4,
