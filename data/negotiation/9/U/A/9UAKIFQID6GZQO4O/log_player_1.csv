{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value for Bob, which could encourage him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob. He clearly recognizes the value of the product, so there's potential to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is your limit, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $9,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while also leaving you with a substantial savings compared to what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet you halfway at $9,000. My maximum budget remains at $8,000. Could we possibly find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to your desired price point, and accepting his offer of $8,500 would be a good compromise. It's important to consider that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result, and selling to John would only net you $8,000.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic choice at this point."
