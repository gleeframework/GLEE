"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth trying to negotiate. You can get a better deal than $1,100,000, and you have 9 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening move to show I'm serious about negotiating and willing to push for a good deal.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than John's price, it's still not the best possible deal. I have more rounds to try and get closer to my target. There's a good chance Alice will continue to come down in price, especially since she rejected my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to meet Alice's minimum acceptable price, while still being within my budget. It's a bold move, showing that I'm serious about getting the product at a reasonable price. It's possible Alice will accept this offer, but if she rejects it, I'll have a better understanding of how much lower she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, and with only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price within my budget, and it's significantly better than John's offer. While there's a chance I could get a slightly better deal, it's not worth the risk of potentially losing out on the product altogether."
