"Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $11,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,,,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I think I can go a bit higher than $10,000. How about $10,250? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10250.0,Bob,4,,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need a little more than that.  How about $10,750? This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.",10750.0,Alice,5,,,
