Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $115), which would still be profitable for you.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so there's no risk in starting high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
