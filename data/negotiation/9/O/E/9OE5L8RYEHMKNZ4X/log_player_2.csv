"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll aim lower to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is willing to negotiate, but $9,250 is still closer to her initial offer than mine. I'll counter again, pushing a bit closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I see you're willing to meet me partway, Alice, and I appreciate that. How about $8,900?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 8900
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still aiming for a price that benefits me. By offering a specific number and framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hoping to nudge the negotiation towards a close."
