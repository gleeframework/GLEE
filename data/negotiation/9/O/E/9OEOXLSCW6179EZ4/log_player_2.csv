"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Considering its unique benefits for someone with your portfolio, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* **There are 10 rounds to negotiate.**  Bob has time to try and get a better price. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to set the tone of the negotiation.** By making a counteroffer, Bob demonstrates that he's serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a significant discount and still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.**  While it's a step in the right direction, Bob wants to get as close to his $1,200,000 counteroffer as possible.
* **There are still rounds left.**  Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.
* **Rejecting allows Bob to continue leading the negotiation.**  By making another counteroffer, Bob shows that he's committed to a fair deal and is willing to walk away if necessary."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,275,000, which is a solid compromise and reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial limits. Let's see if we can agree on this amount."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
