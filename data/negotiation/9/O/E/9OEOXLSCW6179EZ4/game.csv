"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Considering its unique benefits for someone with your portfolio, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a significant discount and still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,275,000, which is a solid compromise and reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial limits. Let's see if we can agree on this amount.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
