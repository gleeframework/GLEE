{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if we can get a better price.  $120 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming to save more."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $115? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep negotiating, $115 is a good compromise. It's still within my budget, and I'm confident I can get a good deal."
