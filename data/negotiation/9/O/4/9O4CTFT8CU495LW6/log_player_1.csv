"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. The product is a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $875,000? This gives you a good price and ensures I can still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000? That's the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is close enough to my minimum.  There's a chance he'll decline in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
