Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $950,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have room to negotiate."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Unfortunately, Bob has proven to be a tough negotiator. We've reached the final round, and his final offer of $825,000 is still too low for me.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. 

It's time to move on.  I'll sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than settling for less than I believe the product is worth."
