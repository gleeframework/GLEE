"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a figure closer to my initial offer. How about $900,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement quickly. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $825,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's compromise at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. I'm confident you'll agree it's a win-win situation.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about $825,000, and we can call it a day?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $825,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $862,500. This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to get a great deal.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.  What do you think?",862500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $862,500 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think I can do better than that. How about $837,500? I believe that's a fair price for the product, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.",837500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on to bigger and better things.",850000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $850,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere for the product.",825000.0,Bob,10,
