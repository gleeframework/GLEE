Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a $100 offer allows for some negotiation room while still representing a significant profit margin if Bob accepts.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, highlighting the product's potential value to Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay.  If you had more information, you could adjust your strategy accordingly."
