"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000 for this product. I understand it's valuable to you, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product to me.  Let's work towards a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
