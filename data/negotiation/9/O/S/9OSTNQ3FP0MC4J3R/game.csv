"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $150. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest price I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still below what the product is worth to me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $140? It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
