"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This gives you a substantial savings and ensures I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
