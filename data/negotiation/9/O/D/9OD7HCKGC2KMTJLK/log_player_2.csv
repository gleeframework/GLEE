"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While you're trying to save as much money as possible, Alice's offer of $110 is still cheaper than John's offer of $120.
* **The product is worth more to you than Alice's asking price:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is only asking $110. This means you're getting a good deal even with Alice's offer."
