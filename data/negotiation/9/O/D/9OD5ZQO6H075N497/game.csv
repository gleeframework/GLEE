"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe is a valuable asset for your needs. My initial price is $900,000, reflecting its unique qualities and potential. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, recognizing the value this product brings to you.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $775,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $775,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $812,500.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks again for your willingness to compromise. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about we split the difference one more time and settle at $793,750?",793750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $800,000? This is my absolute minimum price, and it's still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,7,
