Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,500. This is my best offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,000 and has even labeled this her ""final offer."" We can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John."
