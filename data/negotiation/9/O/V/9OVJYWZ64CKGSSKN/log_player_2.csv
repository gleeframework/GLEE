"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is lower than John's price of $150, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  Alice might lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
