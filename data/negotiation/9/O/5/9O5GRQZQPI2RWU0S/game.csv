"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I believe this product would be valuable to me, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly better deal. Could we agree on $925,000? This price reflects the product's value to me while acknowledging your initial investment.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
