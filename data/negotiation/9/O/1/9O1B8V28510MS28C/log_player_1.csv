Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I wouldn't part with it for anything less than $2,000,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price ($2,000,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob.
* **Confident tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly suggesting that Bob would be missing out by not accepting.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer."
