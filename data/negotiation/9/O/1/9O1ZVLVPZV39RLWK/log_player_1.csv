Bob's offer:

While Bob's latest offer is slightly better, it's clear we've reached his upper limit and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the significant gap. Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss compared to John's standing offer.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
