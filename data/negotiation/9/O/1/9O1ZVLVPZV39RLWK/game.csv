"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, we're still quite far apart on price. To be candid, I'm targeting something closer to $900,000. If you're able to come down significantly, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
