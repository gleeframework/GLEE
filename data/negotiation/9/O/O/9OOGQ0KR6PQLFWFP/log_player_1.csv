Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, increasing his willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Secure the Best Deal:** By offering a price closer to Bob's valuation, you increase the likelihood of him accepting immediately, avoiding the need to sell to John for less."
