"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial proposal.  Let's meet halfway â€“ I'm willing to let it go for $1,125,000. This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,075,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market conditions.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to be fair. However,  $1,075,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,110,000, but I can't go any lower.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think $1,110,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
