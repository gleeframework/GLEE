"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 seems a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is the best price I can offer at this point.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $775000, but I was thinking we could do $760000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",760000.0,Bob,6,
