"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Show Interest:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to build rapport. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation in case Bob makes a counteroffer.

This approach aims to maximize my chances of getting a good price while also keeping the negotiation open and positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. Accepting Bob's offer would leave me with a significant loss compared to selling to John.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and make a counteroffer that brings the price closer to my desired range.
* **Time:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have ample time to negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $10,500, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The message highlights the compromise I'm making and focuses on finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his initial offer. 

This counteroffer is designed to be persuasive and show that I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is getting closer, I'm still looking to stay within my budget.  I'm ready to offer $10,000, which is my final offer. If this works for you, let's finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. With 6 rounds left, I can't afford to risk further negotiation.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My priority is to maximize my profit.  
* **Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiation could lead to further rounds of counteroffers, potentially lowering the final price. There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price. I'm better off locking in the $12,000 profit now than risking a lower price with Bob.

This decision prioritizes a guaranteed profit over potential future gains that are uncertain."
