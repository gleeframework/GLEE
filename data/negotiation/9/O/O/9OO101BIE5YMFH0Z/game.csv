"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I can afford right now.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $160? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product provides.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about $140? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
