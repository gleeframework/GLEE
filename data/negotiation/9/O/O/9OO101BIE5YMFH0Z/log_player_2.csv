The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking for $200. This is a big difference, and I will definitely try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $160? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
