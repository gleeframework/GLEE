{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum value of $12,000 as possible, but I'm also being realistic by acknowledging Bob's perceived value of $10,000.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested, $11000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $10500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10750 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10625? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $10,625 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to accept it. It's very close to my minimum, and Bob seems to be firm on this offer.  It's better to secure a deal at this price than risk further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price than I hoped for."
