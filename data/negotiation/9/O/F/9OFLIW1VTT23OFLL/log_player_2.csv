"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $1,175,000 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
