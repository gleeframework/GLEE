"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the value,  the price of $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. Let's try $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
