{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. It's also friendly and invites Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  Rejecting his offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $87. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is above your minimum acceptable price of $80 and is close to your counteroffer of $90.  It's a reasonable compromise, so accepting his offer is the best decision in this scenario."
