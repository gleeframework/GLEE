Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $200 is my initial asking price, but I could come down to $170 for you. I think that's a fair deal considering the value this product offers.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $170 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? That's a reasonable compromise, I believe."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm trying to be fair with my pricing. How about we split the difference and settle at $150?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $150, which is her product's value to her.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John. It makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
