Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is the price I'd receive from John, so it's the best outcome for me.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, he knows that if he rejects my offer, I can simply sell it to John for the full value.  This creates a situation where he has to weigh the potential benefit of a lower price against the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
