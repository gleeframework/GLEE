""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price point."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $14,000 (or a bit lower) is still a significant profit over John's offer of $12,000."
