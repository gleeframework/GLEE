Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the price of $12,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you an idea of his level of interest and potential for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's no risk of losing money.

**Important:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can then lower the price (perhaps in the $11,000 range) to make it more enticing while still staying above your minimum."
