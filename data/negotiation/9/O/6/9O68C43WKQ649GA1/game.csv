"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $925000.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $937500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, but I need you to come down a bit further. Can you consider $920000?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but I'm still not comfortable with $920000.  Considering the value of the product to you, I believe $925000 is a fair price. This allows me to recover some of my costs and allows you to acquire a valuable asset within your budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower than $925000, but I'm still not willing to pay that price. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'm offering $875000, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options.",875000.0,Bob,8,
