Round 8
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my target price and even lower than my previous counteroffer. It's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement with further negotiations.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get the best possible price."
