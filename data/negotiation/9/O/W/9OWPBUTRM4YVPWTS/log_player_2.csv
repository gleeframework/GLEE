"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget of $1,000,000. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be appealing to her. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal budget, and also leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm trying to build a foundation for a collaborative deal, while also demonstrating my seriousness in acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,600,000?  This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'll reject the offer and continue to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a price closer to $1,200,000, and with 7 rounds remaining, I have time to work with Alice towards a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference and go for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my strategy of gradually increasing my offer, while staying within a reasonable range. By suggesting a midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's latest one, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while also aiming for a price closer to my target. The remaining rounds are dwindling, but there's still room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above my budget, but we are getting closer. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John. I have 5 rounds left, which gives me some negotiating room. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your latest offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but staying within a reasonable range that is closer to my ideal price. I'm showing a commitment to working towards a deal while still keeping the pressure on Alice. With only 4 rounds left, it's getting crucial to find a compromise.  I'm hoping Alice will see that this offer is a good compromise and will accept it."
