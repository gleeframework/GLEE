"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.  It's important to show him that I'm open to discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I have time for more negotiation rounds.  I will reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,600,000?  This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference and go for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a better deal with further negotiation. I'm willing to risk losing another round to try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your latest offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we are running out of time. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation risks."
