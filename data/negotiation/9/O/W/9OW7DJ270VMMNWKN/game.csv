"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
