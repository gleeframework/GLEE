"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially even exceeding $1500000. I'm willing to let you acquire it for a price of $2000000. This is a price that reflects its potential, but also allows for room for negotiation. Consider the opportunity and let me know your thoughts. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Even though she claims the product is worth more, it's not your goal to make a profit, just to acquire the product.  You're better off rejecting her offer and purchasing from John for a much lower price."
