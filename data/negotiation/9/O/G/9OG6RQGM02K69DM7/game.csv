"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference? I'll accept $9,000 for the product.  This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a fair price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $8,500.  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but how about we try $9,000? This is my final offer, as I'm really not comfortable going lower.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,5,
