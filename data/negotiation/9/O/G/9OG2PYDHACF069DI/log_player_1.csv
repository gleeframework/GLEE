Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening move, aiming to gauge Bob's potential interest and establish a high baseline for the negotiation. I'm confident in the value of my product, but I'm also prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the potential of a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000.  This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest while still holding firm on my value for the product. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price,  $925,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than selling to John and likely the best I can get from Bob at this point."
