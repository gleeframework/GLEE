"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a lower price, and since you have 10 rounds, it's worth exploring that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a bit lower than Alice's offer but still significantly better than buying from John.  I'm also framing it in a positive way to encourage further negotiation."
