"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that would benefit both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,800,000, which is $1,650,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
