"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price, especially if she's motivated to sell.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is my absolute top end. I'm willing to buy it for $12,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $12500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. How about we meet in the middle at $13750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $13,750 is still within your budget.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
