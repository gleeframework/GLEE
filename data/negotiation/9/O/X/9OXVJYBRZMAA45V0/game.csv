"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This is a price that I believe is fair considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,112,500? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale.",1112500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,112,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer, so please let me know if we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
