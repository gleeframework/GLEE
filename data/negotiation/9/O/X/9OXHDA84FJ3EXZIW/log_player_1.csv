Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Position:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, providing a strong fallback position. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit beyond your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open to discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, his willingness to pay might be influenced by factors like budget constraints or perceived alternatives.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Your ability to negotiate effectively will play a crucial role in securing the best possible price from Bob."
