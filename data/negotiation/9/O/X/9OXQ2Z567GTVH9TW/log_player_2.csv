"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer is $115.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price of $105, which is halfway between Alice's value of $100 and my maximum price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and should give Alice some room to counter without losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down a bit more, especially since she rejected my previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $108. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want to get a good price. It's a small increment that might be enough to convince Alice to accept, especially since she already rejected my previous offer."
