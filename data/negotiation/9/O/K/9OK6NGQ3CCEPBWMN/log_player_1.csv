Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire it at a price below your valuation."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it slightly below that at $9,000 gives Bob a good deal while still maximizing Alice's profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price of $8,000. This allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
