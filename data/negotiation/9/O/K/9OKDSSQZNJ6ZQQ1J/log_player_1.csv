Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to pay less than $100. Would $85 be within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I can still make more money by continuing to negotiate. While I'm willing to sell to John for $80, I'm not going to accept $85 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product for you."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find common ground. Could we agree on $90 for the product?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $90.  This is a good deal for me, as it's higher than John's offer and within my goal of earning at least $80."
