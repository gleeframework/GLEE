"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'll accept $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to move forward.  This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
