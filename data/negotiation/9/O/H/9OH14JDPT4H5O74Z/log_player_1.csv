Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I believe it would be valuable to you, but I also have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $100 value as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $80, so you need to offer a price above that.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides leverage. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 creates a sense of urgency (another buyer is interested) and potentially a small ""win"" for Bob if he values it even slightly more than $80. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
