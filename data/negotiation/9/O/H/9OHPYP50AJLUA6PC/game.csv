"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $11,000.  This is a fair price, given that I'm willing to close the deal now. Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll compromise at $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'm not budging any further. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
