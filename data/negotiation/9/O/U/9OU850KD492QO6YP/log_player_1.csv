Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? It's still a good price for you and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $100.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good price for you and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90.  This would give us both a good deal and hopefully get us to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me any closer.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit."
