"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? It's still a good price for you and within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good price for you and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
