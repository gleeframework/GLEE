"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still profit and me to reach a reasonable deal. I'm confident this product will be a great asset to your business.",800000.0,Alice,5,
