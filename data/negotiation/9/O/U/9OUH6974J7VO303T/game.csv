"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $10,150? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about $9,500? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here. I'm willing to make one last concession to see if we can close this deal. How about $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point. Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not convinced that $9,750 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $9,500? I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",9500.0,Bob,8,
