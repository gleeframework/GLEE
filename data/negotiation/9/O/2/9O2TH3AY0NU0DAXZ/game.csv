"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000,  which still offers you a significant value. Let's find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down to $1,000,000. I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a good return. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not comfortable selling for $950,000. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
