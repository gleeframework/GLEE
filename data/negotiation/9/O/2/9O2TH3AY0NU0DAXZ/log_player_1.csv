"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible.  This will allow for some negotiation room while still securing a profit well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000,  which still offers you a significant value. Let's find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down to $1,000,000. I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a good return. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I'll continue to negotiate to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not comfortable selling for $950,000. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
