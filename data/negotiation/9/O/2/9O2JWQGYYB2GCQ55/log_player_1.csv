"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. In light of your budget constraints, I am willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This still allows us to share the value of the product while giving you a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  I'm confident I can secure a higher price with more rounds of negotiation.  Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still committed to getting the best possible price for this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering our previous discussions, I propose a price of $1,080,000 for the product. This still maintains a fair valuation while allowing for a more substantial discount.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I believe there's still room to negotiate upwards.  Selling to John at this point would result in a significantly lower profit, so I'm going to keep working with Bob."

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I believe there's still room for one more counteroffer to secure a better deal. Selling to John would leave a significant amount of profit on the table."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,095,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Let's split the difference at $1,102,500.
