Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest in the product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
