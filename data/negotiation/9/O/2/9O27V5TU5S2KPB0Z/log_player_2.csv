"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for savings:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further, especially since she values the product at $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk Alice might reject Bob's counteroffer, the potential reward of a lower price outweighs the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest in the product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter-Offer:** This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious interest in getting a deal. 
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** The price of $950,000 is a bit more than Alice's value for the product, but significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay elsewhere. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes Bob's willingness to find a compromise, encouraging Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a substantial drop from her initial price of $1,100,000 and is getting closer to Bob's desired range.
* **Closing the Gap:**  While Bob can still try to negotiate further, accepting this offer guarantees a good deal.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential for further savings is now smaller compared to the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:** It's a good compromise that allows Bob to acquire the product at a favorable price."
