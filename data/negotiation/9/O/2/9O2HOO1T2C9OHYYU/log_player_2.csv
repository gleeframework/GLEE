**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds, and while I'd prefer to get a price closer to $590,000,  Alice's offer of $606,250 is getting close enough to my target.  I'm comfortable accepting this price, especially since it's significantly better than buying from John.  It's important to remember that I can always walk away and buy from John, but this is a good compromise and will save me a significant amount of money."
