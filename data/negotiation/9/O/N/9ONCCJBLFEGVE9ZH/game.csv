"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget.  Let me know if you're open to negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $850000 for the product, and I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
