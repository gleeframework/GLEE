Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. It's worth $120 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $115 gives Bob a small discount while allowing you to maximize your profit. This price is likely to be attractive to Bob while still netting you a good return. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might decline. However, by starting with a strong offer slightly below his perceived value, you increase your chances of a successful sale."
