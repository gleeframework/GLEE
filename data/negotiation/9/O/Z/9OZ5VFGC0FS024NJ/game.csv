"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000.  It's a real steal, considering its value to me is significantly higher.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $14500.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I see, Alice. $14500 is still a bit out of my range. How about $14200? This is the highest I can go.",14200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. While $14200 is close, I'm still a bit far from my desired outcome. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $14300. Let's finalize this deal and move on.",14300.0,Alice,5,
