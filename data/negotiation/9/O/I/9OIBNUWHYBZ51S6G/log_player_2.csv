"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I think it's a fantastic fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage John's price and potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice."
