{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer sets the starting point of the negotiation.  By offering the product at its exact value to Bob, it creates a neutral starting point. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product to me for $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below the product's worth to me.  I believe there's room for negotiation and a more favorable outcome.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a more acceptable price, hopefully closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to propose an alternative. Instead of settling on a fixed price, how about we agree on a percentage of the product's value? Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, could we perhaps agree on a price of 75% of that value, which would amount to $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a step down from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm not ready to accept a deal that undervalues my product so drastically.  I will counter with a higher offer, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to negotiate, but a 75% share is still significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on the percentage. How about we agree on 85% of the product's value, which would come out to $850,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would be a fair compromise for me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that we can find a better balance. Could we perhaps agree on a sliding scale based on time? For example, if the transaction is completed within the next week, the price would be $825,000. If it takes longer, say two weeks, the price would be $850,000. This way, you receive a discount for acting quickly, while I get a more favorable price than the initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer, while seemingly a compromise, is still below what I consider a fair price.  The sliding scale he proposes is an attempt to pressure me into a quick decision, which I'm not willing to do. 

Additionally, the value of my product isn't tied to a specific timeframe.  I'm not willing to compromise on my valuation for the sake of a faster transaction.  

Therefore, selling to John, who offers my asking price, is the most logical and profitable decision at this point."
