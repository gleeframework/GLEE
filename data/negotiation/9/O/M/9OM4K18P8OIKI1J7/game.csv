"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product to me for $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to propose an alternative. Instead of settling on a fixed price, how about we agree on a percentage of the product's value? Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, could we perhaps agree on a price of 75% of that value, which would amount to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to negotiate, but a 75% share is still significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on the percentage. How about we agree on 85% of the product's value, which would come out to $850,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would be a fair compromise for me.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that we can find a better balance. Could we perhaps agree on a sliding scale based on time? For example, if the transaction is completed within the next week, the price would be $825,000. If it takes longer, say two weeks, the price would be $850,000. This way, you receive a discount for acting quickly, while I get a more favorable price than the initial offer.",825000.0,Bob,6,
