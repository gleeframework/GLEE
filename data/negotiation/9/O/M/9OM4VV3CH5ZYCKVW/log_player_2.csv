"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, and I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate and get closer to your budget.  Buying from John for $80 is a last resort if negotiations with Alice completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That price is a bit too high for me, though.  Would you consider $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to see how flexible Alice is willing to be. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating the price is unacceptable. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is closer to my target price ($80) but still gives me space to negotiate upwards if needed, without exceeding my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $110 is still significantly higher than my target price and my previous offer. It appears there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counteroffer again before resorting to buying from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $110 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you do $75?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This offer shows Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price range, but I'm still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** $75 is a reasonable compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer.
* **Staying Below Budget:** This counteroffer keeps me below my maximum budget of $80, allowing some room for a potential final compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I can see that you're serious about buying the product. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $92.50 is still above my $80 maximum budget.  While I could accept her offer and pay a bit more, I think there's a chance she might be willing to come down just a little bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I think we're getting close, Alice. How about we settle at $80? That's a fair price and it works for me."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is my absolute maximum budget. I'm making it clear that this is my final offer.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the offer (""fair price"") might make it more appealing to Alice.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John for $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think $80 is getting closer, but I'm still not willing to sell it for less than I need to make a profit. I can do $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she won't go below $95.  It's time to cut my losses.  I've negotiated in good faith, but I'm not going to exceed my budget.  Buying from John for $80 is the best option now."
