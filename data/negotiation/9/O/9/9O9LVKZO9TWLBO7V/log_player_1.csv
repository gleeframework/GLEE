Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested buyers and a ""limited-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Gauging Bob's personality and negotiation style beforehand could influence the initial offer."
