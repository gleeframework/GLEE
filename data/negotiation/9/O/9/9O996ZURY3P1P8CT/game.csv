"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is way outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go as high as $800,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, so please consider it carefully.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and honesty. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,100,000 is still a lot more than I can reasonably pay. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let's try to meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value in this product, but we need to bridge the gap between our expectations. Let's be a bit more ambitious with our offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's contingent on you moving significantly from your current position. Do you see a path forward?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  Let's try $1,000,000. This shows a clear commitment from my side, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  My final offer is $1,700,000.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to explore other options.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
