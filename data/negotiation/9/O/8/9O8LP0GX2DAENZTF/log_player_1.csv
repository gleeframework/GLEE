Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a back-and-forth that could lead to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still higher than my minimum, but shows flexibility to reach a deal. This should be a reasonable counteroffer that might encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm making one final counteroffer at $115. This is only slightly higher than Bob's offer, but it's still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob into accepting the deal. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John for $120, as there's no guarantee further negotiation will get me a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer hasn't changed, and I've already made my best counteroffer.  I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum price, so I'll sell to John for $120 to guarantee a sale above my minimum."
