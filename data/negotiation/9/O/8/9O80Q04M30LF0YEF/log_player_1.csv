"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value for the product is $100.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than $100, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I believe it's fair, and hopefully, Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial price, $125 is still a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  It's better to take the offer and avoid the possibility of further negotiation."
