"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That's closer to your offer, and it still gives me a reasonable profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair. How about $112? It's a little higher than your offer, but I'm really trying to make this work. Let's see if we can close this deal.",112.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $109 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $111, which is closer to your last offer. Let's make this happen!",111.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $107? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making this deal work.",107.0,Bob,8,
