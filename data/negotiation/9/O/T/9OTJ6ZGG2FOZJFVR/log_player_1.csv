Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and can greatly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial high offer helps you assess Bob's level of interest and flexibility. His response will give you valuable information for your next move. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have John willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net. You're not pressured to accept any offer below that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  I need to negotiate further to see if I can bridge this gap. I'm willing to come down in price, but not to $12,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By coming down from $20,000 to $17,000, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  I'm still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer, closer to my minimum and reflecting the product's worth to me. 
* **Encourage a Counteroffer:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to either accept or propose a counteroffer that's closer to a realistic deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob's offer of $14,000 suggests he's unlikely to go much higher. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. It makes no financial sense to accept a lower offer from Bob when I can sell to John immediately for a better price.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away entirely, while also costing me time and effort. John represents a secure and immediate deal."
