"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but not so high as to be immediately unreasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This gives us some room to negotiate in future rounds.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message sets a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation. 
* **Jhon's Offer is a Safety Net:** I have Jhon's offer as a fallback, which means there's no urgent need to accept a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I also need to make sure I get a fair price for my product.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to sell it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to see the value.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate it. Could you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal, especially since I have Jhon's offer as a backup. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and efficiently."
