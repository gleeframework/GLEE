,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. Would you be willing to consider $87.50? I think that's a fair compromise considering the original price was $100.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $89.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you are still interested, let me know.",89.0,Alice,5,
