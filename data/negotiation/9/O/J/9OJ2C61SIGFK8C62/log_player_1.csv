"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I still have 9 rounds to close the deal, and there's no need to rush into a deal that's so far below my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm counter-offering at $10,000, which is closer to my minimum value but still gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to a compromise:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal for both of us"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Reiterating my stance:** I'm reiterating that $8,000 is unacceptable, demonstrating my firm stance.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
