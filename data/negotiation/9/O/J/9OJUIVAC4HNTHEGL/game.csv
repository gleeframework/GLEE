"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  I can't go as low as $120, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not sure I'm willing to pay $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,4,
