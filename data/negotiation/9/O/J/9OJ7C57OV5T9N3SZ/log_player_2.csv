{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** $600,000 is a significant amount of money, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to sell for less. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A 33% reduction from her initial price is a significant drop, but it's still within the realm of possibility. I'm aiming to find a middle ground between our initial positions."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from her initial price, but $550,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price. My counteroffer of $450,000 is a compromise, meeting her halfway from my previous offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my seriousness in purchasing the product, while still keeping the price within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down again, $525,000 is still a bit high. We're getting closer, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get the price lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're nearing the middle ground between our initial positions. This offer of $500,000 shows a commitment to buying the product while still pushing for a more favorable price. I believe Alice might be willing to accept this as a compromise, especially with only a few rounds left."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $512,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $512,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and her offer of $512,500 is getting closer to my desired price. With only a few rounds left, I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a higher price. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product for a price significantly lower than John's, and it's within my budget."
