{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not too high that it immediately seems unreasonable. It also emphasizes the value of the product and expresses confidence in Bob's interest. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob is willing to pay the minimum price I'm willing to accept, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and avoid any further negotiation."
