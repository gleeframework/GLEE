"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value of the product to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
