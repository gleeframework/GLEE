{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. I'll also be aware of John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer because it's more than what he initially wanted to pay, it's still a loss for me.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by rejecting his offer and continuing negotiations. I also have the backup option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me more leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500? This price still leaves some room for both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $10,500 is a compromise, showing flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Staying above minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Clear communication:** The message reiterates that $9,000 is too low while emphasizing the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal. 

By offering a price in the middle, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept while still keeping a safety net of John's offer if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $15,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob and try to reach a mutually agreeable price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with $9,750.  It's getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  To make this work for me, I'd need to sell for $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying above minimum:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum of $15,000, but it's a more significant compromise than my previous offer.
* **Meeting halfway (again):**  This offer is a middle ground between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,750. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and making the offer seem more appealing.

I'm hoping that this offer will encourage Bob to accept, as it demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price. If he rejects it, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
