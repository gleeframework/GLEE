"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500? This price still leaves some room for both of us to get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with $9,750.  It's getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  To make this work for me, I'd need to sell for $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,5,
