"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This offer stands until the end of the next round.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $8,000? This is my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
