"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is not my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and it allows me to recover most of my costs.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  It's also the price John is willing to pay, so I'm not looking to waste any more time. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
