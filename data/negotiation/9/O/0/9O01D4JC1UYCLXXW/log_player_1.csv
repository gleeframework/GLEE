Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This price is fair considering your value of $1000000 and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
