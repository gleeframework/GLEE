"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This price is fair considering your value of $1000000 and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
