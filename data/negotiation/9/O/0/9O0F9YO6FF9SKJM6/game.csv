"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $10,000? It's fair to both of us and ensures a successful transaction. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
