"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to compromise, Alice, but I still think the product is overvalued. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, at $1,300,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to be reasonable about the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is steadily increasing his offer. While $1,300,000 is tempting, holding out for a slightly higher amount is strategically sound. I'm confident I can get closer to $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,325,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but I need to be convinced that this is the best deal I can get. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to my acceptable range, but I want to test his willingness to move further. His increments are getting smaller, suggesting he might be reaching his limit. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering accepting or moving to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this negotiation. I'm willing to make one final concession to seal the deal today.  Let's settle on $1,300,000. This is my absolute best offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal that this is my final offer. By framing it as a concession and my ""best offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. This offer is still a significant profit above my minimum and a fair compromise considering his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I need to be convinced that this is the final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer has dropped significantly, and he seems stuck at $1,250,000.  Furthermore, his language suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a potential $50,000 profit compared to John's offer. While there's a slim chance of squeezing a bit more from Bob, the risk of him walking away entirely is too high at this stage.  It's more prudent to take John's guaranteed offer and avoid jeopardizing the deal any further."
