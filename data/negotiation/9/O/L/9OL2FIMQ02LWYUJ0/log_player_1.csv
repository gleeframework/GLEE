"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so accepting Bob's offer of $6,500 is not a good deal.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a good option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $6,500 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,250?  I'm flexible on this, but need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. "", ""product_price"": 7250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $7,250 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $7,000?  That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise. Selling to John for $8,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $7,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $7,100?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  How about $7,050? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $8,000, I think it's a good idea to accept Bob's offer of $7,050.  This is a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether by being too stubborn.  There's a good chance that I wouldn't be able to get a better offer from John if I reject Bob's offer."
