"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $6,500 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,250?  I'm flexible on this, but need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. ",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $7,250 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $7,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $7,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $7,100?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",7100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  How about $7,050? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget.",7050.0,Bob,6,
