"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing confidence in the product and appealing to Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my desired $130. While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my target. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
I'm offering a counteroffer of $125. It's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, and allows for further negotiation in future rounds if needed.  I'm also emphasizing the value for Bob to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $115? I really think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer.  I'll try to find a middle ground that's more profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference - $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob.  I'm sticking to my desire for a price above $115 but am showing willingness to compromise. I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not sure if $120 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is close to my minimum, it's still below what I want to make.  I'm not in a rush to sell and I'm hopeful I can get closer to my desired $120. I'll make one more counter-offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. Let's meet at $115.  It's just a small difference from your last offer, and it allows me to make a fair profit. This is my final offer, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $115.  This is a compromise, but it's also the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm emphasizing this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage acceptance.  I'm also reminding Bob of the value he'll get at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $108 is very close to my minimum but still below it.  With only two rounds left, I'm not sure I can convince him to go higher, and I'm running out of time. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, although a smaller one than I was hoping for."
