{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's likely Bob will counter, and I'll be prepared to negotiate further, keeping in mind my minimum selling price of $10,000. I also have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum selling price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us. If not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $9,500 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's the lowest I can go while still making sure I get a fair price for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price, and I'm happy to sell to him at that price. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I could risk losing the sale altogether.  It's better to accept and secure the sale."
