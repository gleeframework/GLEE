"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is aggressive, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price, showing Bob the value I see in the product and my willingness to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm dropping my price slightly to show good faith and encourage Bob to come up in his offer. This counteroffer still leaves significant room for negotiation, but demonstrates that I'm serious about closing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now getting close to my desired price, and I'm confident that we can't reach a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's time to close the deal and secure a solid profit."
