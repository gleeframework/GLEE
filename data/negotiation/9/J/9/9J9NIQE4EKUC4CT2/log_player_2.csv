"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high value to you, we believe it's worth every penny of the $10,000 you're willing to pay. However, to facilitate a smoother transaction and considering the current market conditions, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a special offer that I hope will make it more accessible while still allowing us to fairly compensate for the product's quality and value. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if you have any further questions. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor you to a high initial price ($10,000) even though you never explicitly told her your budget. Her discounted offer of $9,500 is still above your maximum and John's price. Rejecting her offer might lead to a better counter-offer or you can simply buy from John for $10,000."
