"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move to meet you closer to the middle. How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to go to $1,275,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we are getting close. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.  What do you say, do we have a deal?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,300,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to close a bit lower. How about $1,285,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1285000.0,Bob,6,
