Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,300,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to close a bit lower. How about $1,285,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is steadily increasing his offers and we are getting close enough to my ideal price. Accepting at $1,285,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through entirely."
