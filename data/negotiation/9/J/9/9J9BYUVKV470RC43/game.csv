"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
