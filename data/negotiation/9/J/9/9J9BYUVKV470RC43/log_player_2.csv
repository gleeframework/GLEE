"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable piece and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal target of saving as much money as possible.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is a good price for Bob.  It's within his budget and significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away or that he'll end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price and avoid the potential risk of losing the deal."
