{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good deal, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $60, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $75. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's worth to Alice is $150."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. There's still time to make a counteroffer, and I think I can get a better deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above my ideal price point. With several rounds remaining, I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can push for a lower price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $70."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $75. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting this product, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my budget. This offer is only $5 less than Alice's last offer, and hopefully, she'll be willing to accept this middle ground."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and Alice's offer of $90 is still above my budget. It seems like we're hitting an impasse. I don't want to risk going further and potentially losing the deal entirely. At this point, buying from John for $100 is the safest option to ensure I get the product within my budget."
