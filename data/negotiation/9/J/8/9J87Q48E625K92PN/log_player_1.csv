{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, aiming to maximize my potential profit. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob and highlight the value of the product. This sets the stage for a negotiation, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me at a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my desired profit margin and below the guaranteed $1,000,000 I can get from John.  I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $800,000 is lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to complete the transaction without delay."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher on the price I'm willing to pay. How about $900000? I think that's a fair price for the product and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm still closer to my desired profit margin with John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob, as I might end up with an even lower price.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
