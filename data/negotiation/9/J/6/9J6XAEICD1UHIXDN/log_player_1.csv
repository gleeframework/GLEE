"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, knowing that Bob has a lower valuation. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and my minimum value. This shows flexibility while also trying to reach a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm hoping I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only four rounds left, and Bob's offers continually decreasing, I don't think I'll be able to reach a price that's satisfactory for me.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
