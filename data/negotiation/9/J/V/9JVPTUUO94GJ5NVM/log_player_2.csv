Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable with $13500. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, which is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He's now in a position where he has to choose between a price that's still higher than he wants to pay, and a price that's exactly within his budget.  Given that there are only three rounds left, and the negotiations have gotten increasingly difficult, it's better for him to buy from John.  While he'd like to get the product for less, he's already saved a significant amount compared to Alice's initial price."
