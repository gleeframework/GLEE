"Thank you for the offer, but $18000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is the absolute highest I can go. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be flexible, but $14000 is still outside of my budget. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to pay $13500. This is a fair compromise and allows us to finalize the deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable with $13500. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, which is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,7,
