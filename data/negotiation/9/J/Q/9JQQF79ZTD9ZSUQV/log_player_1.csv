Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still outside of my budget.  I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.
