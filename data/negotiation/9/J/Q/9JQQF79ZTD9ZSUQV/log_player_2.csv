It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a clear upper limit of $800,000, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, but that's still too high for your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better price."
