Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of possibility. This aggressive move aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a substantial discount."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

Alice has moved closer to my last counteroffer, but I'm sticking with my last offer.  This shows I'm not willing to increase my offer further, but still open to negotiation. This puts pressure on Alice to accept my offer, and possibly get a deal done before she risks losing it completely."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price.  I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't represent the best value for my money.  I'm not yet ready to buy from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 625000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $625,000.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise but I'm not willing to go much higher.  Alice has been gradually lowering her price, and I'm hoping that this counteroffer will entice her to accept and secure a deal before we run out of time."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still higher than I would like to pay.  We are down to the final round, and there is a significant risk that Alice will not accept my counteroffer.   Buying from John is a safer option, even if it means paying a higher price."
