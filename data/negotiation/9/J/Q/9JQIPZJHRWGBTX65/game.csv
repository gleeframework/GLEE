"Bob, $13,000 is closer, but still a bit low. I'm willing to go down to $14,500. Let's try to close this deal.  If we can't agree, I'll need to consider my other options.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,750 is still a little too low for me.  How about we compromise at $14,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",14250.0,Alice,7,
