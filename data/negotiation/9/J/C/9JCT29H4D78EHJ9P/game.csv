"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to secure the product for a slightly lower price. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate a good deal, but I have to consider the value of the product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to cover my costs.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
