"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is exactly $1,200,000, there's no room for a discount. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price.  There's no immediate benefit to buying from John, as he's offering the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to secure the product for a slightly lower price. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate a good deal, but I have to consider the value of the product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to cover my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a $50,000 saving compared to John's price.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer ensures a purchase at a lower price without risking losing the deal entirely."
