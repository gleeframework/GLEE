"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a minimum of $1,500,000 to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well. Let's start with a price of $1,750,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your price point. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. Let's compromise. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,600,000, which is still a fair value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise. This reflects the value I place on the product and the potential it holds for you. Let's close this deal!",1550000.0,Alice,5,
