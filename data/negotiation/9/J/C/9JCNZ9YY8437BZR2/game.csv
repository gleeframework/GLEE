"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable asset. I believe it has immense potential and I'm confident it will be worth far more in the future.  My initial offer is $1000000.  This is a significant discount from what I believe its true worth to be, but I'm eager to see this asset in the right hands. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
