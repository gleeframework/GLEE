Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  $1,150,000 is a strong opening offer. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes a willingness to discuss price, signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to counter-offer.

**Why this is better than offering $1,200,000 or more:**

* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Starting at or above your guaranteed price gives Bob no incentive to negotiate, and you might miss out on potential profit."
