Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,100,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  $1,075,000 is close to John's offer, but I don't want to sell for that low without seeing if Bob will budge."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $1,075,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows you to still get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to John's offer.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away and I'll end up with John's offer which is less than I want.  It's time to take the safe option and sell to John."
