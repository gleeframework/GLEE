"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. 
* **Reasonable Jump:**  The counteroffer is still a reasonable jump from Alice's cost ($10,000), making it more likely she'll consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message keeps the negotiation friendly and signals that we're open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $12,500 is still significantly higher than her cost and our ideal price. We have rounds to spare and should try for a better deal. 
* **Maintain Momentum:** Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation active and shows Alice we're serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** We're moving in smaller increments now, signaling that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Clear Target:** We're explicitly stating a price target ($11,500) to give Alice a clear understanding of our expectations.
* **Maintaining Positivity:**  The message remains polite and collaborative, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."
