"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $95? This would still give you a great deal, and I wouldn't have to sell to someone else.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",87.5,Bob,4,
