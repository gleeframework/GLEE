Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring you still make a profit. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. You want to maximize your profit, and selling to John at $120 is the guaranteed best option. However, rejecting Bob's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $95? This would still give you a great deal, and I wouldn't have to sell to someone else."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.50 is closer to your desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  The negotiation is becoming a bit drawn out, and it's uncertain if you'll be able to reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob.  Since John offers a guaranteed sale at your minimum price, selling to John is the most rational and profitable choice."
