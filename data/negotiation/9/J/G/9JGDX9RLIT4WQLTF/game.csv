"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a good price, and I get a quick sale.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $850000? That's still a significant saving for you, and it's a price I can work with.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above $850000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $810000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",810000.0,Bob,4,
