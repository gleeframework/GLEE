"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $100?  That's the absolute maximum I can pay, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
