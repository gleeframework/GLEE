Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
