"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product at the same price as John, there's no advantage to buying from Alice. It's better to buy from John, as the prompt states you will buy from John if you reject Alice's offer."
