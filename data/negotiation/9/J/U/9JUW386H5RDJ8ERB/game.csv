,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price.  $108 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about $110? That's a reasonable price considering the value of this product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $108. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",108.0,Bob,6,
