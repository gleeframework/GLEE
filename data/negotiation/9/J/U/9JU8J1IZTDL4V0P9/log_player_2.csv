"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. Let me know if you're interested!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's closer to his budget, Bob can still try to negotiate further.  He has a few more rounds to work with, and the possibility of buying from John for $800,000 gives him leverage. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $880000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer of $880,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He has a few more rounds to negotiate, and the possibility of buying from John for $800,000 gives him leverage to continue pushing for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $880,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $860,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $870000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $870,000 is only $70,000 more than Bob's ideal price of $800,000. Given the limited rounds remaining, the potential for a successful negotiation with Alice, and the risk of losing the product, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice.  There's a good chance that Bob won't be able to negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds, and he doesn't want to risk ending up with nothing."
