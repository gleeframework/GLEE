# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her true value, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a compromise, it's still above my budget.  I'll try to get a lower price from Alice, keeping in mind that I can always buy from John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,175,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $1175000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm offering the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, her offer is still above my budget. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit here. While I'm keen on getting this product from you, $1,300,000 is simply too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to reach your limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $1200000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm offering the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to our last few rounds.  Alice's latest offer is still above my budget. I have already pushed hard in negotiations, and while there's a chance we can get a better deal, the risk of running out of rounds and being stuck with no product is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John, who is offering a reliable price within my budget."
