"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects its worth while still offering you a competitive price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a considerable distance from what I have in mind. To settle this quickly, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair compromise considering the value this product brings.",975000.0,Alice,5,
