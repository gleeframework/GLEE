"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is well above his budget. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects its worth while still offering you a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,000,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his limit of $800,000.  He can continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a considerable distance from what I have in mind. To settle this quickly, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair compromise considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer of $975,000 is still above Bob's budget.  John offers a much better price, and there is no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a better result."
