"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you be open to $975,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.
