Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for negotiation and prevents you from immediately selling to John.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

Remember, you can adjust this offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of his potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired range.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John willing to pay $1,200,000, there's no immediate pressure to accept a lower offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain negotiating leverage:** This shows Bob you're serious about getting your desired price.
* **Potentially get a better offer:** You can make a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to move higher.
* **Secure the guaranteed sale:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you can still sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for a fair deal. Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  The offer is between your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and Bob's last offer ($950,000), showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value helps justify your counteroffer.
* **Encourage compromise:**  The message uses language that encourages Bob to meet you halfway and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stay within my budget. Would you consider $960,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While there's some room for negotiation, it's approaching a point where the potential gain from continuing the negotiation is not worth the time and effort. 

By selling to John, you ensure:

* **Guaranteed higher price:** You secure the full value of the product, avoiding a potential loss by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Time efficiency:**  You avoid further negotiation rounds and can quickly finalize the sale.

While you might be able to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the certainty and speed of selling to John outweigh the potential benefits of further negotiation."
