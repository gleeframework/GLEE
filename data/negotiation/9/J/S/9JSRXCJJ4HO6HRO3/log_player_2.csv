"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it at $140.  
* You can save money by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. 
* Even if Alice rejects your counteroffer, you have 9 more rounds to negotiate before needing to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a bit more aggressive than just splitting the difference. 
* This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* There's still room for negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $145 is higher than my initial counteroffer of $130.
* However, it's still lower than her initial offer of $140, so there's room for further negotiation.
* I'm not yet willing to pay $145, as I still have time to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. 
*  $135 is still a good deal for me, and it's closer to Alice's last offer of $145. 
* This should put some pressure on Alice to accept, knowing I have the option to buy from John for $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $150 is now equal to what John is selling the product for. 
* At this point, there's no further benefit to negotiating with Alice. 
* Buying from John saves me time and ensures I get the product without further hassle."
