"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd be willing to sell to John, as this gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm letting Bob know I'm willing to compromise, which could make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob, which could make him more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold:** While his offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough to justify selling to him right now. 
* **I have room for more negotiation:** I have 8 rounds remaining and can use them to try to reach a higher price. Selling to John immediately would be a missed opportunity to potentially maximize my profit. 
* **I'm confident I can get a better offer:**  I believe I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is still a bit below my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a fair profit. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, so let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** I'm not dropping too much from my initial offer, signaling that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Reiterate the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to him, hoping to nudge him towards a higher price.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given it some thought and am willing to consider $1,050,000 as a potential compromise. I hope this proposal is within your range and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of losing out:** With only 6 rounds remaining, there's a risk that continued negotiation could lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown in negotiations.
* **Opportunity cost:** Accepting Bob's offer means I'll get a decent profit and avoid the risk of a lower offer in future rounds or having to sell to John for a lower price.

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's crucial to balance the potential for a better offer with the risk of losing the deal altogether. In this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option."
