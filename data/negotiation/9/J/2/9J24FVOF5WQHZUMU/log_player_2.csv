"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. A $700,000 price is a good start, but I can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $650,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $675,000 is a good compromise. It's a decent price, and we're making progress in the negotiation. It's better to secure the product at this price rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price."
