"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport.
* **Direct Offer:** I'm making a clear and direct offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price.
* **Value Proposition:** I can emphasize the product's unique features and value to justify a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and my costs,  $10,500 would be a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving slightly closer to Bob's price.
* **Value Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value and my costs to explain the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion.
* **Maintain my Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I'm still aiming to stay within $10000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $10250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time is on my side:** I still have 6 rounds left, which gives me time to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by making a counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** It's important to show Bob that I'm committed to getting a fair price for my product, even if it means continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about $10,750? This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to cover my costs and you to get a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $500, demonstrating a willingness to move towards Bob's position, but not settling for his initial offer.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a fair compromise, which can make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, reinforcing why a slightly higher price is justified. 
* **Maintain Minimum:** My offer is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but I'm showing flexibility to reach a mutually agreeable price."

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value of my product. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still committed to getting a fair price. How about $11,000?

```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've been thinking about our conversation and believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. Would $10750 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While further negotiation is possible, the chance of getting a better price from Bob in the limited time remaining is not worth the risk. 

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit, avoid the potential for further negotiation delays, and reduce the risk of ending up with a lower price than I'm comfortable with."
