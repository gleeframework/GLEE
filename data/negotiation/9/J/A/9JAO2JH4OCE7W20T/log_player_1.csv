Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially counteroffer, while still ensuring I get a price significantly above my minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100, so I won't go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good offer and above my minimum, I'm willing to try negotiating a bit more. I believe there's a chance Bob might go a little higher, especially since he expressed interest. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down a little to $113. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 113
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not by the full amount. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product at a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to see how much Bob is truly willing to pay and if he'll meet me closer to my initial offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm still above my ""John price"" of $100, so I have that safety net if Bob doesn't budge much higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a little over budget.  How about $111?  That's the absolute most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Price:** $111 is a solid price, exceeding my minimum by a comfortable margin.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's message suggests he's unlikely to go any higher. Pushing further might make him walk away.
* **Not Worth the Risk:** While I could counter again, the potential gain of a few dollars isn't worth the risk of losing the sale altogether.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
