"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $16,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,5,
