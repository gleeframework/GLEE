Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still leaving me with a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll reassess the situation and adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's a bit lower than my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'm happy to secure a profit of $120,000."
