"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $10,000, so I'll offer $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,000? This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
