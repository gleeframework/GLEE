Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to the product's true value to me.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, but is still a significant profit above his perceived value. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, selling to John quickly at $12,000 might be preferable to potentially longer negotiations with other buyers."
