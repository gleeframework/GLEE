Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is offering $12,000, which is significantly more than John's offer. While I could hold out for more, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away in subsequent rounds.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and it would let us close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
