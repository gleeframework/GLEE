Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($100) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum. 

This strategy balances profit maximization with the chance of a quick sale to Bob."
