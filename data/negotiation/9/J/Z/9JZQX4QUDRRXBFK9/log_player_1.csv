Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage.  You should aim to get Bob to pay as close to his perceived value ($10,000) as possible.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by highlighting the product's value.
* **High Anchor:**  $11,500 sets a high initial point, giving you room to negotiate if needed.
* **Urgency/Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, making Bob more likely to act quickly. 

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $11,500, exceeding your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer. Depending on his offer, you can decide whether to accept, counter again, or walk away knowing you have John's offer.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $12,000."
