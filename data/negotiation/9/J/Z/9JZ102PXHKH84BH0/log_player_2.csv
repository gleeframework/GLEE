"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement today. I am offering the product to you for $9500. This price includes all features and benefits as described, and I am confident it represents a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate the gesture. However, $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer further. My counteroffer to you is $9300 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our respective positions and I believe it provides a fair value for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,300 is still above Bob's ideal price but is lower than John's price of $10,000.  Bob can secure a lower price than John offers, and this is a better option than continuing to negotiate and potentially lose time or risk Alice ending the negotiation."
