"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential of the product, the price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value I believe the product holds.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1400000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
