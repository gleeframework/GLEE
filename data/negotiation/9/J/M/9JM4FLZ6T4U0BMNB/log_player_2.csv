"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth pushing to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my budget, and I'm not sure how much further she's willing to negotiate.  Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to buy from him and avoid any further potential for price increases with Alice."
