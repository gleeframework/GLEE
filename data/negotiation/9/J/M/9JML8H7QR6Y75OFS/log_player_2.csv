"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round to counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $15000. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to come up to $13,000, but that's truly my limit.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $14000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's closer than previous offers, Bob can potentially negotiate further and get a better deal.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and sending a counteroffer is the best choice for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to work this out.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is really my final offer - I can't go any higher."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not going to go any lower than that. Can you reconsider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now repeating her previous offer of $14,000, showing a lack of willingness to budge.  With only 3 rounds remaining and Bob having already countered several times, it's likely that Alice will not go lower. Bob has reached his limit for negotiation. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000."
