Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be even more valuable. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While we start high, we don't want to be outrageously above Bob's perceived value. Offering it at $95 is a potential $15 profit, while still being in the realm of possibility for Bob to accept.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""great deal"" and ""quality"" subtly nudge Bob towards seeing the value in your offer. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, we have a guaranteed $80 sale with John.  This knowledge gives us leverage and means we shouldn't go below $80 in any potential counter-offers from Bob."
