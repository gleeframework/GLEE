"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $750000.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000 to make this deal work. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to offer $825000.  This would be a win-win for both of us, and it would allow me to proceed with the purchase.",825000.0,Bob,4,
