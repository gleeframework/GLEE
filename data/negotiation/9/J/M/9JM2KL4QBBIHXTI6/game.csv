"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. Let's meet closer to the middle ground - how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
