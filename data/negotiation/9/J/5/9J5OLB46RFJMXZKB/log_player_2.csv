"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable asset that I believe could be a game-changer for your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm prepared to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $2000000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round. I don't think the product is worth $2,000,000 to me, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1400000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This price still reflects the value I see in this opportunity, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?
