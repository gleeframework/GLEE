"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the opportunity it presents for Bob.
* **Early Negotiation:**  It's important to start the negotiation process early to see if we can find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product.  There's still room to negotiate a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable value. However, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to potentially secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but making a counteroffer to show my willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  I explain my rationale for the counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive Framing:**  I maintain a positive tone and emphasize the potential benefits of working together."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I'm still hopeful that I can secure a price closer to my ideal value. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a slightly better price from Bob, especially since we're nearing a potential deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a small decrease in my price, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize that this is a ""fair compromise"" and focuses on a positive outcome for both parties.
* **Urgency:** I add a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's finalize this deal!"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Balancing Risk:** While closer to my minimum, I'm still keeping some room for negotiation in case Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,425,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000,  it's still slightly lower.
* **Limited Negotiation Rounds:** We are down to the last few rounds, and the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential of a lower price. 
* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable value, which is a safe and secure option given the remaining negotiation rounds.  

I'm willing to sacrifice a little bit of potential gain for the certainty of securing my minimum value."
