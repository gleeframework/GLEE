Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

This is a good price point to accept.  Alice is signaling this is her final offer and while more negotiation is possible, the potential savings are unlikely to be substantial. It's better to secure the deal at $825,000 than risk the price going up or losing the opportunity."
