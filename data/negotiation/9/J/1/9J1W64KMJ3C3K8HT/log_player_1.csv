"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $13,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle at $9,500?  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've highlighted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be fair to myself as well. Let's split the difference - $10,250, and we have a deal.  This is a final offer."", ""product_price"": 10250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $10,250 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $9,750. This is my final offer, I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $9,750 offer. Taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures I get a fair price."
