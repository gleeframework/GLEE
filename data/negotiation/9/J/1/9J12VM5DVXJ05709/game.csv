"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $875,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $750,000 doesn't reflect that.  To move things forward, I could accept $825,000. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand this product means a lot to you, Alice, and I respect your final offer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  That's the best I can do.",800000.0,Bob,6,
