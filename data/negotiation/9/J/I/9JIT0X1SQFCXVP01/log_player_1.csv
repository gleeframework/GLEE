Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its potential value to me.  I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond its immediate application for you.  It represents a unique opportunity with long-term benefits. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects a significant adjustment while recognizing the true value of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. Let's aim for a more realistic price. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This shows my serious interest while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

We are still significantly below John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob closer to at least $1,300,000."

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. I'm willing to come down further, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my continued interest in the product, but we need to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough decision point. Bob is clearly getting closer to a reasonable price, but we're still under John's offer. Let's try to push him a bit further, but be ready to accept if he doesn't budge much:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to make my final offer -  $1,425,000. This is a significant compromise on my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this deal through. Let me know your decision."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is the point where it's time to cut bait. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we're still losing out on a significant amount compared to John's offer. 

```json

``` 

While it would have been ideal to secure a deal with Bob, accepting his offer at this stage would mean a loss of $200,000. It's a better business decision to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
