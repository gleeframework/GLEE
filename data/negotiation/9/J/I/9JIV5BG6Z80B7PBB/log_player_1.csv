Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap significantly. It makes more financial sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
