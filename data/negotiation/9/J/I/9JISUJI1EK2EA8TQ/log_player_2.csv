"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's a bold move, but if Alice is willing to sell at a lower price, this will encourage her to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing willingness to compromise while still trying to stay below the $1,100,000 mark. This gives Alice a reasonable option while keeping me in the game for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good deal, considering my initial counteroffer and the fact that John's price is $1,500,000. Accepting this offer means I save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. While I might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or having Alice walk away altogether is high. It's time to close the deal and secure the product at a favorable price."
