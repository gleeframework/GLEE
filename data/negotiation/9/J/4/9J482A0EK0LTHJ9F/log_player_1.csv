Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and understanding of the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair and mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

 We are still significantly above Bob's valuation and have room to negotiate. Selling to John now would be leaving money on the table."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us, and it's still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount on the table compared to John's offer. We have room to negotiate further and see if Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While your offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
