"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's a good strategy to start with a higher price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  By stating you're ""open to negotiation,"" you signal flexibility and make Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing that you believe the product is of interest to Bob can help him see its value.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer.  We'll need to see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm not desperate:** While $12,500 is not bad, it's still below my ideal selling point.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for a higher offer. I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Going:**  Rejection signals that I'm willing to continue negotiating, which could potentially lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750? This way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that appears fair and can make the buyer feel like they're getting a better deal.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on getting a ""fair deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Next Steps:**

This is a strategic counteroffer.  Depending on Bob's response, we'll need to adjust our approach. If he rejects, I may need to make a lower counteroffer, but if he accepts, I've secured a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13375. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $13,375 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below my ideal selling point.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate.  I believe there's potential to push for a higher price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the next move and make a counteroffer that might be more appealing. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my desired price, but still above Bob's current offer. This will hopefully lead to a final agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $13,375 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about we compromise at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position while showing I'm willing to come down slightly.
* **Middle Ground:** My offer is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm focusing on a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.

**Next Steps:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move that seeks to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to adjust my approach based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to assess if a lower counteroffer is necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $13400, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Desired Price:**  $13,400 is very close to my desired price point, and the negotiations have been going on for a while. 
* **Time is a Factor:** We're halfway through the rounds, and the risk of reaching the end and having to sell to John for $12,000 is significant.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a price that's close to my ideal, which is better than potentially losing out on a higher price but not getting a deal at all.

**Next Steps:**

It's important to note that I'm accepting this offer because it's the best deal available at this point, considering the time constraints and the risk of losing out entirely. I might have been able to secure a slightly higher price with continued negotiation, but the risk of getting nothing is too great."
