"Alice, your starting price is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I can't go above $1,200,000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000. If you're not willing to go that low, I might need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I also need to be mindful of the product's value. I'm willing to consider a significant price reduction, but only if it leads to a deal. My final offer is $1,600,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other opportunities, including selling to John.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000, but that's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
