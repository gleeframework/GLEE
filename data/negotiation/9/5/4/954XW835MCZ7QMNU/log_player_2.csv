"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand you may not know the full potential yet, but I'm confident it's worth significantly more than the price I'm offering. To demonstrate my faith in the product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from what I believe its true value to be.  Think of it as an investment in your future success. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to see this go to someone who can truly capitalize on its potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
