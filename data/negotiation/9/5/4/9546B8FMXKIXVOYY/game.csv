"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to move on to other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $14,500, which would be $14,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14250.0,Alice,7,
