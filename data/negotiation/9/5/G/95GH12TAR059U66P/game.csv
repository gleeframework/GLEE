,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $750,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and $850,000 is closer to where I need to be. However, I'm still working with a tight budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. ",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. $825,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $850,000, but I'm willing to make a small concession to $840,000 to seal the deal.",840000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and $840,000 is a good number.  However, I'm still working within a limited budget. To make this work, I'd need to bring the price down to $815,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget.",815000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $815,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My counteroffer is $835,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",835000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $835,000 is getting closer, but I'm still pushing my budget to make it work. I'm willing to go up to $810,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to secure a good sale and me to get the product within my budget.",810000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $810,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to get the deal done. My counteroffer is $825,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate with me.  I understand your position and I'm happy to make a final offer to close the deal. I'm willing to go up to $805,000 for the product.  This is the best I can do, and it allows both of us to come to a mutually agreeable outcome. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, as I'm running out of time.",805000.0,Bob,10,
