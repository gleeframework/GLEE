"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle at $1,025,000? ",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,025,000. How about we try $1,050,000 again, or even $1,052,500?",1052500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for sticking with me.  I'm willing to come up a bit. How about $1,037,500? ",1037500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to come up, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,045,000, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle of that and $1,037,500. How about $1,041,250?",1041250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  This is my final offer,  $1,030,000.",1030000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,030,000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot. I'm willing to meet you at $1,035,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1035000.0,Alice,9,
