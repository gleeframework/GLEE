"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is a good deal, but Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I really appreciate you considering me. However,  $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $95.**  This is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $120 to him. 
* **Rejecting and making another counteroffer risks Alice walking away.** It's possible she won't budge further.
* **Buying from John for $120 would be more expensive.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $95 is the best option for Bob, as it gets him the product at a reasonable price without risking losing the deal."
