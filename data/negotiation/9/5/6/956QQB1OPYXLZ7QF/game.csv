"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $22000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can we meet in the middle at $19500?",19500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $19500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $20500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",20500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still not quite ready to commit to $20500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle again?",18000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll propose a counteroffer of $19000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $19000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle again?",17500.0,Bob,6,
