"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
