Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

While Bob's offer is getting closer to reasonable, it's still significantly less than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to guide him closer to a more acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us, but $1,600,000 is considerably below its true value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, considering its value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below my minimum. I need to hold firm and see if I can nudge him closer to at least $1,800,000.  I'm willing to counteroffer again, but I'll need to emphasize the value proposition more strongly."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value proposition of the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product, but I'm getting close to my limit. I hope we can find a compromise.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is a tough decision point. Bob is getting very close to a reasonable offer, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to risk one more counteroffer. I need to convey a sense of urgency to encourage him to close the deal now."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

Bob has met my psychological bottom line. While I might have been able to squeeze out a bit more in a perfect world, accepting $1,800,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away altogether.  It's time to close the deal."
