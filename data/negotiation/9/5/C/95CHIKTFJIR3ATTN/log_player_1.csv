Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe I can get a better price if I negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I've already reached round 4 and there's a chance we'll keep going back and forth. I don't want to risk running out of rounds and being forced to accept a lower price. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum and saves me time."
