Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value:** This creates room for negotiation without immediately making Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This leaves room for potential concessions without jeopardizing your minimum profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It gets the negotiation going without being too aggressive or ambiguous. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to achieve my goal. It's worth risking a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $900,000?  That's a fair price that still allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about $860,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my goal than his previous one, it's still too low. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $860,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to be flexible, but we need to find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $880,000? That's a fair meeting point, and it allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about $840,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $850,000, and it's getting closer to the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob keeps going lower instead of higher.  Even though my goal is to earn as much as possible,  it's time to cut my losses.  I'm confident I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's time to end the negotiation with Bob."
