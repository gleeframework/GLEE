"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $900,000?  That's a fair price that still allows both of us to walk away happy.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $860,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to be flexible, but we need to find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $880,000? That's a fair meeting point, and it allows us to finalize this deal.",880000.0,Alice,5,
