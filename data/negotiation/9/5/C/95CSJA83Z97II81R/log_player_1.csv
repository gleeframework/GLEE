Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  You're not selling below your minimum value of $80.
* **Below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $100, so he has room to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable:** A $5 discount from Bob's value is a fair starting point.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your potential profit:** You're aiming for a high price, but you're also willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain your bargaining power:** You've given Bob a reason to negotiate, but you haven't given away too much. 
* **Be prepared for a counteroffer:** If Bob rejects your offer, you'll be ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is above your minimum of $80, it's significantly lower than your initial offer of $95. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your bargaining power:**  By rejecting, you show that you're not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Potentially get a higher price:** You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, aiming for a better deal.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** Selling to John is a backup option, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps the potential for a higher price alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. It shows you're willing to negotiate but still want a fair price.
* **Reasonable:** $90 is still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $100.
* **Pressure:** By reducing your offer only slightly, you put the pressure back on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping your profits in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is very close to my minimum value of $80 and also above John's offer of $80. Here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Minimizing risk:** Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's offer of $80. 
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting avoids further rounds of negotiation, saving time and effort.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $87 is a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial resistance and my minimum price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a decent price without risking losing the deal altogether."
