{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This initial offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for Alice. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1120000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,120,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
