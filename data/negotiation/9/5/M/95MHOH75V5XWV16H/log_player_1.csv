{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. I want to maximize my earnings, but I also want to keep Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is a fair price for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer $100, it's more beneficial to sell to Bob than to John at this point.  There's a good chance I could get a higher price from another buyer in the future, and the negotiation process is getting tiresome."
