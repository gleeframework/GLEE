"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $180 is above Bob's maximum budget of $150.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $140 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and still within Bob's budget. This is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $165 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his maximum of $150.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to get a lower price. It's worth risking another round to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $150.  This offer is Bob's maximum price, but it's also the price John is selling the product for.  If Alice accepts, Bob gets the product at his maximum price. If she rejects, Bob can always buy from John.  There is no incentive for Bob to offer a lower price at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $160 is still above Bob's maximum price of $150.  At this point, Bob has two options: continue negotiating and risk not getting the product or buy from John for a guaranteed price of $150.  It's in Bob's best interest to buy from John and secure the product at his desired price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better deal, and Bob is already within his budget by purchasing from John."
