Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm starting with a reasonable counteroffer of $110, which is still above Alice's value but below my maximum price.

* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if needed."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $115, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my budget.  How about $112?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'd get a lot of use out of this product."", ""product_price"": 112} 
```

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $112, which is a slight decrease from Alice's offer and brings us closer to a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $113 is still slightly above my target price of $150, but it's getting closer to a point where it's worth accepting.
* **Negotiation:** Alice has continued to compromise, showing a willingness to meet me halfway.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I could end up paying more, or even having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal without the risk of further negotiation."
