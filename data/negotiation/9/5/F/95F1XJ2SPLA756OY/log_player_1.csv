Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is more than Bob's initial value of $100, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm reducing my price a bit, but still remaining above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also signals that I'm not desperate to sell at a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  Since there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better price, I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of losing a sale altogether."
