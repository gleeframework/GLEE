"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of 130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 130 was a bit high, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to 115. How about we meet in the middle at 125? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
