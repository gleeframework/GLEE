"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? ",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. I can see you're willing to pay $10,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you a deal for $11,250. Let me know if that works for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on that price, but I'm still hoping to find a way to make this work.  Would you be open to $10,750? It's a fair compromise between our last offers and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11000.0,Alice,5,
