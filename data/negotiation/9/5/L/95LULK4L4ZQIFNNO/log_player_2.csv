**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. I can see you're willing to pay $10,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you a deal for $11,250. Let me know if that works for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a better price than John's $12,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a good chance that Alice will stay firm at $11,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob money and ensures he gets the product."
