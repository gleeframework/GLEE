"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our exclusive product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to maximize the value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth negotiating further with Alice to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness in making a deal. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, $1,150,000 is still above your maximum budget. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can reach a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,125,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final compromise of $1,125,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,125,000 is still above your preferred price point, Alice has clearly indicated this is her final offer.  You've already negotiated a decent discount from her initial price.  At this point, accepting her offer is the best option to secure the product and avoid the higher price from John."
