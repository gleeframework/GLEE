"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $10000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000, which would be $10000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's unique features. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $10500. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10000, and I'm not budging from that price. I'm starting to think that I should just buy the product from John for $10000 instead.",10000.0,Bob,8,
