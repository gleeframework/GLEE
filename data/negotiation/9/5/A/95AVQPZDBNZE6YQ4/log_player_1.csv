This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $14,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my counteroffer and significantly higher than selling to John.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
