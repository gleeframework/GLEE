"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's slightly above my minimum acceptable value and leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to try and negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still pushing for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate further.  However, I'm starting to get concerned about running out of rounds, so I'll be more flexible in my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. This shows my willingness to compromise, but also that I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. I'm hoping that this will be enough to secure a deal before we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Although I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, we're running out of rounds, and it's getting increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value, and ensures I don't lose out on a potential deal."
