"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject the offer. $50 is a good price, but you can likely get it lower. There are 9 more rounds, so you have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40} 
```

You're starting the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range you're willing to pay. This shows you're serious about getting a good deal, while also giving Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has lowered her price and is now offering a price that's close to your initial counteroffer. It's a good deal, and it's likely you won't get a better price with the remaining rounds.  Accepting the offer saves you time and potential further negotiation."
