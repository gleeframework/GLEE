"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $9000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $8750 at this time. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it fair.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $8750 is still a bit below what I can accept.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to drop the price to $8900. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested.",8900.0,Alice,5,
