Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150:**  This is a starting price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and open to negotiation, but also highlighting the value of the product. 

I'm aiming for a good starting point that gives me leverage in the negotiation while also being appealing to Bob. I can adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is my minimum, Bob's offer is at the absolute bottom of my acceptable range. I'm not desperate to sell and I want to see if I can get a better price. 

I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great value for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Split the difference:** This shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise, but not at the cost of my own profit.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price. 
* **Fair price:** This emphasizes that the new price is beneficial for both of us.

By offering a middle ground, I'm hoping to find a mutually acceptable solution and avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$125 is close to my minimum:**  While I'd prefer more, $125 is only $5 less than my minimum and a significant increase from Bob's initial offer of $120.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a lower price. 
* **Time is valuable:** It's more efficient to accept this offer rather than risking more rounds of negotiation that may not result in a better deal.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a price that's close to my minimum while minimizing the risk of losing the sale and having to accept John's offer of $120."
