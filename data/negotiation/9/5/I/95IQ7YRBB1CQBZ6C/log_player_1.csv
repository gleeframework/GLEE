"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am only able to offer $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value ($10,000) but still below it.**
* **I have 9 rounds left and can still potentially get closer to my desired price.**
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to maximize my profit.**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $9,250? This is a fair compromise that values both our needs."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget constraints, I am willing to go up to $9,100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is still a bit below my desired price point.**
* **I'm still within striking distance of getting closer to my target.**
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I'm hopeful of getting a better deal with Bob in the next few rounds.** 

I'm going to counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $9,150. This reflects a genuine effort to make this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I am pleased to offer $9,100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We've reached a stalemate.** Bob is unwilling to go higher, and I'm unwilling to go lower.
* **I've only got 4 rounds left.**  Time is running out, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000. 
* **John is a sure thing.** He's already committed to buying the product at my desired price. 

While I'm a bit disappointed I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, securing a sale to John is the most sensible decision at this point."
