"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer starts high, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's also significantly higher than John's offer, making it more appealing to Bob. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is a decent sum, it's still below my target price. I believe I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that is so far from my target. I believe I can still push for a better price, especially since Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

I'm countering with $1,320,000. This is another compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I believe this is a fair price, given the value of the product to both of us, and it leaves room for a final deal in the next few rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a higher price. We're close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm not ready to give in just yet. I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round and see if Bob will accept. If not, I'll sell to John."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's just above Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still securing a good profit. If Bob rejects this, I'll move on to John and secure the $1,000,000."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,180,000 is more than I initially wanted, it's still significantly less than what I was aiming for. With only one round left, I don't have time to negotiate further. I'm better off selling to John for $1,000,000. This will ensure I still earn a decent profit while minimizing the risk of ending up with no deal at all."
