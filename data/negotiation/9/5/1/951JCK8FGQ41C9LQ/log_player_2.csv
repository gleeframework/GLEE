This amount reflects the product's true worth while allowing for a fair negotiation that respects our respective interests. I believe this offer strikes a balance between maximizing my earnings and providing you with a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. Please let me know if you would like to discuss further or proceed with this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from Alice, which is $300,000 less than buying it from John.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $1,500,000, and you're getting it for $1,200,000, saving you $300,000."
