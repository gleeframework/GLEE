"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still too high for a product worth $120 to you.  It's better to reject and try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $95, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, this offer is likely to be acceptable to her, while still saving me some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is lower than Alice's first offer, it's still higher than my ideal price. I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further. I'll reject the offer and try to counter with a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $90.  This is a compromise from my previous offer of $85 and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for Alice to come down in price. Since she rejected $85,  I'm betting she'll be more likely to accept $90, especially since it's still lower than her offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still higher than my ideal price. I want to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price. I'm still confident I can get a better deal than buying from John for $120, so I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $95. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $90, and it's closer to Alice's last offer of $105. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to meet her halfway.  Since Alice rejected $90, I believe $95 might be an acceptable price for her, especially since it's closer to her perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is getting closer to my maximum price, I'm still hesitant to accept. We are only three rounds away from my maximum price, and it's still possible to get a lower price.  I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get Alice to come down further.  I'm also wary of being ""too close"" to my maximum price, as it might make it harder to secure a lower price later on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $100. This is a significant jump from my previous offer of $95, but it is still lower than Alice's offer of $110.  This shows I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm also running out of rounds.  Since Alice rejected $95, I believe that $100 might be an acceptable price for her, especially since it's closer to her perceived value of the product. With only three rounds left, I need to make a move that's likely to be accepted by Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is getting close to my maximum price of $120, I'm still hesitant to accept. It's only one round before my maximum price.  I want to see if I can negotiate one last time before buying from John. There's still a chance Alice might lower her price, so I'll try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer to $110, which is still below Alice's offer of $115, but very close to my maximum price. With only one round left, I need to make a move that is likely to be accepted by Alice. Since Alice rejected $100 in the previous round, I believe that $110 might be an acceptable price for her. This is the best I can do while still staying within my budget, and it allows me to avoid buying the product from John at a higher price."
