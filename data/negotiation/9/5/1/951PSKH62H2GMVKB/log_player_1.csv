"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I will reject Bob's offer. While I am willing to sell to John for $100, I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob. I will try to counteroffer with a price higher than $100, but still lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally like to get more, Bob has already raised his offer to $115, which is significantly better than the $100 I would get from John.  This is a good compromise and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
