"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its worth to me is $800,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $925,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 remains below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not convinced it's a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $925,000, which is $37,500 below your last offer. How about $962,500?",962500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about reaching a deal, and I respect that. While $962,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a rounder figure. Let's settle at $980,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. Please consider this my final offer.",920000.0,Bob,8,
