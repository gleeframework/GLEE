"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its worth to me is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,025,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $925,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price, but we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a price above $1,000,000, and giving up now would be premature. We'll continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 remains below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not convinced it's a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $925,000, which is $37,500 below your last offer. How about $962,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer, but his latest offer is still a significant amount away from our $1,000,000 target. We're willing to negotiate, but we need to hold firm to signal that we're serious about the value of the product. We'll counter with a smaller concession to show we're willing to move, but not drastically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about reaching a deal, and I respect that. While $962,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a rounder figure. Let's settle at $980,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still reflecting the product's inherent value."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. Please consider this my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has signaled that $920,000 is his absolute limit and he's unlikely to budge further. While we've managed to negotiate him up from his initial offers, the gap between his final offer and our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) is too significant. It's time to cut our losses and secure a guaranteed sale with John at our desired price."
