# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to negotiate further.  I want to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the best possible value.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I hope you'll find it reasonable."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $850,000 is a good deal. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John, and it's closer to my ideal price point.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a stalemate."
