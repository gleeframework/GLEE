"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  It's only round 4 and I have more rounds left to see if I can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing that we're not quite on the same page yet. I'm willing to come down a little further to $15,500. This price is still fair, considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $14800 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, we're running out of rounds.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000, I'm going to sell to John and avoid the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale than to keep negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
