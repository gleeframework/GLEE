Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price. I think it's worth taking the deal at $12,500."
