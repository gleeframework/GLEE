Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about $13,500? This would give you a good deal, and still allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I want and it's a good compromise. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
