Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum value of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob would still be getting a good deal at $1,000,000, as it's less than the $1,200,000 he values the product at.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for some potential back and forth without making you seem unreasonable. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $900,000 for the product? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good deal, we can likely get closer to our goal of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good tactic for a few reasons:

* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** You're not just sticking to your original price, showing flexibility to Bob.
* **It's still within Bob's range:**  $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum value.
* **It's closer to your goal:**  This offer gets you closer to your desired price of $1,000,000.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
