"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than $150. However, for you, we're willing to consider a special introductory price of $180. This is an excellent opportunity to experience the benefits of our product at a slightly higher value than its usual price. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the special price, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $130?  This is the absolute most I can afford at this time. ",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I propose a price of $145 for the product. This still reflects its true value while being more accessible to you. Please let me know if this works for you, or if you'd like to propose another price.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm really hoping we can make this work. How about $135? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget.",135.0,Bob,4,
