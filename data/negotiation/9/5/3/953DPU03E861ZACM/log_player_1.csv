Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this to be a fair offer considering its potential worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows us to potentially maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
    * Slightly below our guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000), leaving room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, we can still sell to John at our desired price. This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price while having a safety net."
