Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,150,000 is still significantly attractive to Bob (saving him $150,000 compared to your alternative) while giving you a substantial profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
