"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $200. It is not a good deal for Bob.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

Bob should offer the minimum he is willing to pay, which is $100. This gives Alice some room to negotiate but still keeps the price within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $180 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $100, saving him $80 compared to Alice's offer."
