Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
