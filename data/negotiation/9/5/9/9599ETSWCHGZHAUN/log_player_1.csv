"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is appealing enough to Bob while still giving me a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I believe this price is fair, reflecting both our needs, and I'm confident it will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $920,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm not desperate.  I still have several rounds left to negotiate and I believe I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm going to counter with $940,000.  This offer is closer to Bob's last offer and shows I'm willing to be flexible. I believe this price is fair and will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $915,000 is a decent price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially with several rounds left to negotiate.  I'm not desperate, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $930,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate but also not willing to budge much further. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a compromise point that will be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds left, the negotiations are getting tense.  Bob's offer of $910,000 is still below my desired price.  While I could try to counter again, there's a real risk of losing the deal altogether.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get my minimum value and a good profit, even if it means missing out on a potential deal with Bob."
