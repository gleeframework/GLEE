"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that.",850000.0,Alice,5,
