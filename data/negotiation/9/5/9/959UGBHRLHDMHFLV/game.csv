"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while still making it accessible for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to go up to $1,500,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
