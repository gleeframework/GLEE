"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a very high starting price from Alice, and you should definitely reject it.  You can do much better with a counteroffer."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $22,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go above $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $22,000 is closer to the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
