"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,900,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction and a price that ensures a win-win scenario for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the reduction. However, given my current financial situation, I am still unable to meet the $1,700,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this is within the range that you are considering.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
