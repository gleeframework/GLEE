Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $75. What do you think?,75.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $75 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $75 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $70? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a compromise.",70.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $65?  That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $65. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $72? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",72.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you value the product, but I have a budget in mind. I can do $66, but that's the best I can offer.",66.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $66. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $69? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm trying to find a middle ground.",69.0,Alice,7,
