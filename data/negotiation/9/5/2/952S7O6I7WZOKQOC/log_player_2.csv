"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to someone in your position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,500. Would you consider $13,500? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than $14,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. By rejecting, he can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target price of $12,500."
