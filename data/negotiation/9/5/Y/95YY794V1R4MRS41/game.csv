"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be happy to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to pay $9000, which is closer to my budget and feels like a fair compromise.  I'm really interested in this product, so let's see if we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget, and I'd like to offer $9250. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also being within my range. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9500 again, but I'm also willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free setup service and a 1-year warranty. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll find it's a fair price for the product and the added value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thanks for including the extras, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9000. I understand you have your minimum, but I'm also working with a budget.  How about $9250, which feels like a good compromise?  Let's see if we can make this happen.",9250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I need to make it clear that this is as low as I can go. I'm including the free setup service and 1-year warranty, and I'm willing to throw in a 10% discount on the price. This is the absolute lowest price I can offer, and I'm hoping you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,9,
