Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob is offering a price significantly lower than my initial ask, but still more than my minimum. I think there's room for negotiation.
