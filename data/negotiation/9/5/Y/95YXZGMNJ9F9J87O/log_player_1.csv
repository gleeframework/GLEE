Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Price:**  This is the minimum amount Alice is willing to accept, which is $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob believes the product is worth $1,200,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Alice has a backup offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum perceived value. This maximizes the chance Bob accepts while ensuring Alice earns more than her reservation price.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,190,000. I believe it offers tremendous value, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Price:**  $1,190,000 is just under Bob's valuation, making it highly appealing.
* **The Message:** The message is positive, highlighting ""value"" and ""confidence"" to encourage Bob's acceptance.

**Important Notes**

* There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer, but this strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit.
* Negotiation is possible. If Bob counters, Alice can slightly adjust the price, but should never go below $1,500,000."
