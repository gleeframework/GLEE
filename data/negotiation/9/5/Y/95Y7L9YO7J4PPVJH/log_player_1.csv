"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1300000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I can potentially get closer to my target price of $1,500,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I believe I can push for a bit more, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still not quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's try to get this deal finalized, as I'm confident this product will be valuable to your business."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing a final offer of $1330000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  I've been negotiating for several rounds now, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much better results. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale and avoid the risk of further rejection from Bob, which could lead to a loss of the sale.  It also allows me to avoid selling to John, who is offering my desired price, but I want to see if I can establish a relationship with Bob for future business opportunities."
