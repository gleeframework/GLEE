"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $950,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to sell this product close to its actual value, and $950,000 falls short of that.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $1,150,000?  This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
