{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value, it's still above your maximum.  You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's a chance Alice will accept a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's still attractive to Alice while staying well within my budget.  This forces Alice to make a decision: accept and make a profit, or risk losing the sale altogether."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'll try to push for a lower price by making another counter-offer. I'm hoping I can negotiate a price closer to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. It's my maximum budget and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Alice can accept this offer and get a good deal, or risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, and continuing to negotiate with her is risky. I've already made multiple counteroffers, and there's no guarantee she will accept a lower price. It's more efficient to buy the product from John for my maximum budget, guaranteeing the purchase and avoiding further potential negotiation."
