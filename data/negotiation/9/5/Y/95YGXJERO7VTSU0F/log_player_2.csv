"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget. There's potential to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $700000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your ideal price point. There is still room for negotiation to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe we can find a compromise at this price."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $650000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $675000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and $675,000 is a good deal for you. While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and the possibility of having to buy from John at a much higher price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
