"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the inherent value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part and shows my commitment to acquiring the product.  Let's find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still below the product's true value. I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,700,000 is still higher than my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product in my eyes. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
