"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth $10,000 to both of us. To start our negotiation, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you're willing to pay up to $10,000 and Alice is willing to sell for at least $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the negotiation. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for this product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
