"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000.  However, the value of this product is incredibly high, and I can't let it go for less than $925,000. This is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,3,
