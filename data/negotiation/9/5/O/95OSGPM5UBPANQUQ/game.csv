"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
