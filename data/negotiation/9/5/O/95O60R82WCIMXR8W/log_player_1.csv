Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  You still have room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It shows you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining your desired profit margin. 

Keep in mind that this is just a starting point. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and the overall negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While you want to earn as much as possible, you also want to ensure you get at least $15,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as you might be able to reach a price closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while hopefully remaining attractive to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **It's a significant increase from Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at an unreasonable price.
* **It's still below your minimum value:** You have room to lower the price if necessary, but you're not conceding too much. 
* **It's a fair compromise:** It attempts to find a middle ground between your desired price and Bob's offer.

By offering a counteroffer, you show Bob that you're serious about making a deal, but you're also not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
