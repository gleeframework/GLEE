{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $15,000 because that's the value I place on the product.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a $3,000 gap between our valuations. 
* **First Offer:** Starting at $14,000 allows for some room for negotiation and potentially secures a deal quickly. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John as a buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage in case Bob is unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's still a significant gap between our valuations.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, so there's no urgency to accept Bob's offer.
* **Counteroffer Potential:**  I can counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value, potentially leading to a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise from my initial offer of $14,000, but I still need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Midpoint Approach:**  $13,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not shutting the door on negotiations. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while keeping John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and allows me to secure a good profit.
* **John as Backup:**  I still have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not losing out on a potential better deal. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I minimize risk and secure a sale that is close to my desired price point."
