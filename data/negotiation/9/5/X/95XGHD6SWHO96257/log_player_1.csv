Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $18,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is not showing a willingness to meet near my minimum price. His offer is now significantly lower than both my initial asking price and my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in subsequent rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
