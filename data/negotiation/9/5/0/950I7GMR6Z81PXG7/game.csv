"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $1,050,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other interested parties, so I'd like to move quickly on this.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
