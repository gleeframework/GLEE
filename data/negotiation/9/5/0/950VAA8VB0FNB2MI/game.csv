"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
