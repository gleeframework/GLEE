"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110. This is above Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. I want to maximize my profit, and $110 would be a good start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I'm going to try to counter and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to accept, but I'm also ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is still too low.  I am going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to think selling to John might be the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering $100. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
