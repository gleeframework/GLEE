Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is well above your minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's space for a counteroffer that benefits both of us. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling:**  A high opening offer demonstrates your confidence in the product's value.

This strategy aims to achieve the best possible price while still keeping the negotiations open."
