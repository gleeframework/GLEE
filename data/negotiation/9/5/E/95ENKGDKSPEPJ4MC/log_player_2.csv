"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll choose to reject Alice's offer. Since I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is $200,000 more than Alice's offer, it's not worth it to buy from Alice.
