Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

At this point, Alice seems quite firm and you're getting close to your maximum budget. It's better to accept the $1,025,000 offer and secure the deal, rather than risk Alice walking away or having to buy from John at the higher price."
