Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  It's a unique item and I believe it would be of great value to you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering the product at $19,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's space to negotiate downwards, potentially still exceeding your minimum price of $15,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a potential rejection from Bob.
* You can adjust the initial offer price based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
