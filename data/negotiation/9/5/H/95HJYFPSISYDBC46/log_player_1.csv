I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'll be ready to counter any offers Bob makes, but I'll keep John's offer of $150 in mind as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'll reject his offer and counter again, hoping to get closer to a mutually agreeable price."

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I hope this counteroffer is enough to get Bob to agree."
