"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. It is worth $8,000 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I am willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get the product for less than $7,500, and it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $7,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of my product. I am unable to accept $6,500. However, I am willing to consider $7,000 as a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, Alice has shown she's willing to compromise.  At $7,000, Bob is still getting a good deal compared to John's price, and there's no guarantee he'll get a better offer from Alice."
