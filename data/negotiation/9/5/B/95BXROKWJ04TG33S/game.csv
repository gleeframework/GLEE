"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this valuable product for a price significantly lower than its true worth. While it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a substantial deal for both of us, giving you a valuable asset at a lower price and allowing me to finalize the transaction quickly. Consider this offer carefully, as it won't be available for long.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
