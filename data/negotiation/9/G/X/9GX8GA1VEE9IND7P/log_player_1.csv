"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for showing me the product Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to let it go for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a great product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $75? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and it's better to secure a guaranteed $100 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
