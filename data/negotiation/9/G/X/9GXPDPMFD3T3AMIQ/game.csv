"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $1 million. Let's start with a counteroffer of $1,100,000.  I'm open to further discussion to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle - I propose a price of $1,850,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,850,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This would be a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  However, I need to be closer to  $1,500,000 to make this work on my end. My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential this product holds.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
