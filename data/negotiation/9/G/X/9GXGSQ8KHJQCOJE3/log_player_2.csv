"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $135, which is less than your maximum budget of $150 and less than John's offer of $150. Accepting this offer saves you money."
