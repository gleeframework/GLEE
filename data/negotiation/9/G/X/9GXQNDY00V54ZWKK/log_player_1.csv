"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. I want to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay. This also gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1,100,000?  This would still be a significant deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the unique value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm going down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price above $1,000,000, which is my minimum. I believe $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I initially wanted more, $1,050,000 is a good price and significantly higher than what John is offering. There's always a risk that I could get a better offer later, but I don't want to risk losing out on this deal altogether."
