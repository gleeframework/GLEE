Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before going to John (who guarantees $150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's interested.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** This price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), but below John's guaranteed purchase price ($150), maximizing potential profit.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, it represents a strong starting point to potentially secure a higher profit than the guaranteed $150 from John."
