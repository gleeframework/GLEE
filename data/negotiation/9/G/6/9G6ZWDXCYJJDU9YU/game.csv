"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. Is $1400000 something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if $1300000 is enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about it for a moment. How about we meet at $1350000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for this unique item.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about it for a moment. How about we meet at $1280000? It's still a bit above your last offer, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price for this unique product.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
