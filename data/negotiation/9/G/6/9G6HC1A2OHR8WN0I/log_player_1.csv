Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $14,999. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price creates the perception of a deal and leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning that you're offering it to him before listing it publicly creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
