"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the value of the product for both of us, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a little too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $950,000?  That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,000,000 to $950,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, as he is getting the product for a price significantly lower than what he would pay John ($1,200,000). While there might be room for further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the potential need to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings from a lower price."
