"Hello Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline your offer. Our product has a unique value proposition that justifies a higher price point. I would like to counter with an offer of $750000. This price reflects the product's quality and the value it will bring to you. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of offering $725000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. After careful consideration, I am inclined to accept your offer of $725000, as it aligns closely with our valuation of the product. However, to ensure clarity and fairness, I would like to confirm that this offer includes all necessary services and additional benefits as previously discussed. With this understanding, I propose that we finalize the transaction at $725000.",725000.0,Alice,5,
