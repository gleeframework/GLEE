Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's split the difference. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This offer is still within a reasonable range for both of us and ensures a successful deal. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the significant value this product provides for your business.  I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need a figure closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about $975,000?  This offer is a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve our goals.  Let's work together to finalize this mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $925,000 just isn't a price that makes this deal work for me.  To find common ground, I'm offering a final compromise at $950,000. This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
