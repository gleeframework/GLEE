"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Its value to you is clear, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its significant worth.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's split the difference. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This offer is still within a reasonable range for both of us and ensures a successful deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market. I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the significant value this product provides for your business.  I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need a figure closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about $975,000?  This offer is a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve our goals.  Let's work together to finalize this mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $925,000. I believe this is the maximum I can reasonably pay for this product, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $925,000 just isn't a price that makes this deal work for me.  To find common ground, I'm offering a final compromise at $950,000. This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for your business, and I want to see us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
