{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $12,000 and brings the price closer to your maximum budget of $8,000. It's a fair starting point for further negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."
