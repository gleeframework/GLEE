"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $6,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While I do see the value in the product, $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we try $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
