"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you showing me this product. However, $9500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $8200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $7500. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm counteroffering at $8100. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
