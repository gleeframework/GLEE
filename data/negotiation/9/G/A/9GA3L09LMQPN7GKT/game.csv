"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $7500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8250. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to cover my costs. Let's find a way to make this work.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. How about $7875? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",7875.0,Bob,4,
