"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to consider buying it for $90.  Let me know if that's a possibility for you.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $105 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it and what you're willing to pay. I hope we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
