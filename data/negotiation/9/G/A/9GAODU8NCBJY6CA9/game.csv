"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's a high-quality item that truly stands out in its category. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe we can come to an agreement that suits both of us. Considering the product's worth to you is $80, I propose a price of $95. This allows for a fair transaction where you receive great value for your money while also compensating me adequately for my investment in the product. Please let me know if this proposal works for you, or if you have any suggestions for a price that would be acceptable to both of us.",95.0,Alice,1,
