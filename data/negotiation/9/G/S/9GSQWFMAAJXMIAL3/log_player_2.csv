"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price with Alice, but he shouldn't commit to anything yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $14,000 for this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $17000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay, and he has the option of buying from John for a lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $14,000. This is the most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on your offer of $14000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, to $16500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,500 is getting closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay, and he has the option of buying from John for a lower price. With only three rounds left, Bob is better off holding out for a lower price or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $16,500 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to move on to another seller."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  With only one round left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to his desired price.  He's already negotiated down significantly, and buying from John will save him $4,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
