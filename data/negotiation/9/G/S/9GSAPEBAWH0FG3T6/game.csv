"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still fair.  Let's say $12,000. That's a great deal for both of us, and it will save you from having to search for something similar elsewhere.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
