"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still fair.  Let's say $12,000. That's a great deal for both of us, and it will save you from having to search for something similar elsewhere.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
