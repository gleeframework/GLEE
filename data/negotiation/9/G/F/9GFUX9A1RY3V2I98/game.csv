"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $1,350,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a competitive offer considering I could buy it from John for $1,500,000.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and the option you have with John. However,  $1,400,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 as a final compromise. It's a fair deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk and uncertainty of you going to John. Let's make this happen.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
