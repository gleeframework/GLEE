"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I believe you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to offer $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $10,800 is closer to his target, but he can likely still get a better price. He'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still a little hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  This is a fair price considering the potential savings you'll gain by selling it to me rather than going through John.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,700. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away from the deal.  At $10,700, Bob is still saving money compared to buying from John, and the risk of a breakdown in negotiations is high. It's time to accept the offer."
