"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I believe you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to offer $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into it. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still a little hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  This is a fair price considering the potential savings you'll gain by selling it to me rather than going through John.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,700. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
