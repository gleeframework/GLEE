"I appreciate the effort to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider meeting me at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. If you're still not willing to meet me at $8000, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,5,
