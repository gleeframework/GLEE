Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're guaranteed at least $800,000 from John, so this offer is above that.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation and potential profit for both parties.

This offer gives Bob a good incentive to buy from you, while still allowing you to potentially earn more than your guaranteed amount from John.  You can always adjust the price based on Bob's response."
