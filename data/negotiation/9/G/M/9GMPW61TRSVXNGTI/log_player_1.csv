Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
