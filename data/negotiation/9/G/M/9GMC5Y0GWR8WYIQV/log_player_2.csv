(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer."

``` 
Let's continue to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  We're still quite a bit above my target of $1,300,000, so there's room to keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $1,350,000."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We are close to the target price of $1,300,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, especially since we have a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1330000}
``` 

Let's offer a price slightly higher than our last counteroffer, but still lower than Alice's last offer, aiming to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is $1,360,000. While we're still above our target of $1,300,000, we are getting close and there are only a few rounds left. It's likely that Alice won't come down further, and we risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to reject her offers. Accepting this offer allows us to secure the product for a price that is still below our initial budget."
