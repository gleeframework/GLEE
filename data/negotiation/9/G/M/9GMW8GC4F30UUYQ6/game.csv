"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than that to both of us. I could consider a price of $1,300,000.  This feels like a fairer offer reflecting the true potential of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  To be honest,  $1,300,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,000,000?  I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
