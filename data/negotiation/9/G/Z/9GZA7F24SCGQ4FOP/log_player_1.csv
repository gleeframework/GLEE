Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $170. It's worth every penny! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing that I can always adjust it depending on Bob's response. I'm also trying to pique his interest with a positive message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for that low of a price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $145? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $145, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can convince Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $130 just isn't enough for me. Let's compromise at $140. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to go up to $140, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $130. How about $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $135 is getting close to my minimum, I've only got 4 rounds left. I'm not confident I can get Bob to go higher, and I'm running the risk of him completely walking away.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
