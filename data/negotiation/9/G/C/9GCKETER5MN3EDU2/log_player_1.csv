Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it holds great value for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value of $1,500,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's why this strategy is good:

* **Strong Starting Point:** It shows you're serious about selling to Bob and establishes a clear value for the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:** You have room to lower your price if Bob counteroffers.
* **Plan B:** You have John as a backup buyer, giving you leverage if Bob doesn't meet your expectations. 

Remember, the key is to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your strategy accordingly. Good luck with the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value.  While you could accept it and get some money, it's not worth the risk.  You have John as a backup buyer who will offer you a higher price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price.  This could lead to a successful negotiation with Bob or you can still fall back on John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's unique potential and the value it could bring to your operations, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You've lowered your price from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Provides a clear reason:**  You've justified the price by highlighting the product's potential value to Bob.
* **Keeps a margin:**  $1,700,000 is still above your minimum value, ensuring you get a decent return.

This is a balanced approach that gives Bob a chance to reconsider while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its potential benefits to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now exactly at your minimum value, and while it's tempting to accept, it's time to take the guaranteed deal.  You've had a good negotiation with Bob, but ultimately John offers the same price without the risk of further negotiation or rejection.  

The key to this kind of negotiation is recognizing when to walk away, even if it seems like a good deal on the surface.  It's better to have a guaranteed outcome than to risk losing the sale altogether."
