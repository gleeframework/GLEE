"Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be closer to my budget.  How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're getting close, but $7,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
