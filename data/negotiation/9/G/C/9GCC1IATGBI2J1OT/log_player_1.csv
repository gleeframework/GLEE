Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $1500, which is better than selling to John.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so there's some wiggle room for him to counter-offer. 
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:**  This helps make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and increases the chance of a successful negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can always come down a bit, but it's best to start high and see where the negotiations lead."
