"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can you meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go that high. Can you consider $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial situation, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and it's closer to your budget.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $12,750? I think that's the highest I can go.",12750.0,Bob,6,
