{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'm also framing it positively, highlighting the value of the product to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is still below my initial asking price, it's a fair compromise and a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation.  I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale."
