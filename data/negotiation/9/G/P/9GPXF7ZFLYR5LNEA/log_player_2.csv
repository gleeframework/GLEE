"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11500. This is a special opportunity to secure a high-quality item at an exclusive price. I believe it's a fair deal considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I would like to offer you the product for $11000. It's still a premium price, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he knows he can get it for his target price from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
