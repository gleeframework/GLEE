"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it's necessary to leave room for negotiation and ensure I maximize potential profit.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $900,000 is more than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can come to a more agreeable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still a significant amount, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's getting close to the price John is offering, but I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better deal with Bob. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. It's a signal to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to settle for his current offer. This is a last attempt to see if Bob will come up to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at the minimum price I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the minimum profit I'm comfortable with."
