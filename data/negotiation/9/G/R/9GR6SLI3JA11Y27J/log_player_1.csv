{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very keen on the product, while still securing a profit for you.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John provides a safety net. This means you shouldn't go below $120 in your offer to Bob."
