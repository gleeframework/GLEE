"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not comfortable going below $10,800. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'll offer the product for $10,700. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10700.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you say that $10,700 is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to meet you there.  $10,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
