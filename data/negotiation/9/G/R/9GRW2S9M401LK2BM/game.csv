"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $80.  That's fair for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. What do you say?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. How about we meet at $81?",81.0,Alice,5,
