"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. Considering the unique benefits this product offers, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. I believe this strikes a balance and reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. It shows you recognize the value this product brings. How about we settle at $1,800,000? This allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not ready to commit to $1,800,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
