"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I'm not afraid to be bold with my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $800,000. It's significantly lower than my minimum value and I believe I can get a better price. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not convinced Bob can't go higher. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my previous offer. There are still several rounds left, so I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and only $100,000 away from my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to close the deal at this price to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $950,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not convinced he can't go higher. I'm also wary of selling for too close to my minimum, as it leaves little room for error or future opportunity cost. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that we are getting close to a deal and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We are down to the final few rounds and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to sell for more, it's not worth risking a deal completely to try and squeeze out a few more dollars.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, so I'm going to take that deal."
