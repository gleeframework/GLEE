This is a high starting price, but it allows for negotiation.  It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, while still leaving room for compromise. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low.  I need to push for a much higher price.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering the price to show a willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a significant profit. This offer is closer to Bob's initial offer, but still leaves me a good margin compared to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low. I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price. I will counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but this time by a smaller margin. This shows a willingness to compromise, but still keeps the price above John's offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is much closer to my target price, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm continuing to lower the price, but by a smaller amount than before.  I'm hoping this will be enough to sway Bob and reach a deal.  I still believe I can get a higher price than John's offer, but I'm getting close to the point where I might have to consider selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counter-offer is still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  It seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm worried that continuing to negotiate will just waste more time.  John's offer is guaranteed, and at least it gives me a solid profit.  I'll sell the product to John."
