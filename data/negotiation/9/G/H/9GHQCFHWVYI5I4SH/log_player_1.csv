"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. However, your starting price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it reflects the worth of this product."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $975,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I can do $725,000. This offer keeps us moving towards a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below the product's value to me and what John is offering. It's worth continuing the negotiation a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. To be fair to both of us, I can drop to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm making a smaller concession this time to signal that I'm reaching my limit.  By stating it's my final offer, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a more serious move if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000, which I believe is a very fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer increases are getting smaller, and he doesn't seem willing to reach a price point that's acceptable to me. It's clear that we are unlikely to bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees the full value and avoids further negotiation risk."
