"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10000 at this time.  Would you be willing to work with me on that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more, and I'm confident it'll be very valuable for you. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $13000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12500?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for your product, and I'm trying to stay within my budget.  I'm not comfortable going above $11000 at this point.  Would you be willing to consider that?  It's a good compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
