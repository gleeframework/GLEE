"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10000 at this time.  Would you be willing to work with me on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $12,000.  I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more, and I'm confident it'll be very valuable for you. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  It's closer to my minimum, but I'm going to try and push for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for your product, and I'm trying to stay within my budget.  I'm not comfortable going above $11000 at this point.  Would you be willing to consider that?  It's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been stubborn on his offer, and I'm starting to run out of time.  While I would prefer to get more, I'm not confident that Bob will budge further.  To guarantee I don't lose out, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000."
