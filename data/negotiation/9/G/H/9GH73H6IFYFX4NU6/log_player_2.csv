"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's target of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and the potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above his own target. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also emphasizing his desire to save money.  A $50,000 drop is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, but still a bit high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get an even lower price.  There are still multiple rounds left, and Bob doesn't want to settle for a price that's still above his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1260000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's last counteroffer was rejected, so he needs to increase it slightly to show a willingness to compromise. However, he's still aiming to stay below $1,280,000. A $20,000 increase is a reasonable step towards meeting Alice halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $70,000 above Bob's target. With limited rounds remaining, it's a good time to accept the offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
