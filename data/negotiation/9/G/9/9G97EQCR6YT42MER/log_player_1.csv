Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its potential return on investment for someone like you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high price.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net. Alice doesn't need to desperately sell to Bob."
