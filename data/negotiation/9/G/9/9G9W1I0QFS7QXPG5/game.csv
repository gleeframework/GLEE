"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
