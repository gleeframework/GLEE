"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $13,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,500? It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it brings.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,750 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $11,200? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11200.0,Alice,5,
