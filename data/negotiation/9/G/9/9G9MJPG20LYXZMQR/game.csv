"I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $101? That's the absolute limit for me, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",101.0,Bob,8,
