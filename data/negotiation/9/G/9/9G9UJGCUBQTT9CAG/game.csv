"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $825000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $850000? It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about we meet at $790000?",790000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. We are getting closer, but $790000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800000. This would be a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. If you're not able to reach this price, I'm happy to explore other options for selling this product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
