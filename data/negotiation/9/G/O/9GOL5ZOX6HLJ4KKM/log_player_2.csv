"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob's initial counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,025,000?  It's a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about purchasing the product."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000. This is a very competitive price, but I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily decreasing the price through counteroffers, and Alice has met him halfway.  At $1,030,000, Bob is saving a significant amount compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  While there's always a chance he could negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling through is increasing. It's a good deal for Bob, and accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures the product."
