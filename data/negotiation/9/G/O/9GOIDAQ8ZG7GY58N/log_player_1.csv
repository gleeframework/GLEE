``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal as quickly as possible while still maximizing my profit. By starting with a relatively high price, I'm giving Bob room to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of a deal in the first few rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1400000. I would like to propose an alternative offer of $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I believe there's room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. This keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but I believe I can potentially get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
