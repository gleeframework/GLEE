"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to your business as well. I'm offering it to you for $2000000.  This is a competitive price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1500000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and go with $1750000?  This still leaves some room for profit for me and is a significant investment for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1625000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
