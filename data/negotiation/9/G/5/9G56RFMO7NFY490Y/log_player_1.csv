"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe I can get a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can get closer to my goal. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer in the next round to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This shows good faith and is a significant compromise. It's still within a range I'm comfortable with, and I believe it will be enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is improving, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can push him to increase his bid in the next round.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but if his offers don't get closer to my desired price, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm further reducing my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant move towards Bob's last offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm not willing to give up on achieving a price that is closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not at a point where I'm willing to accept it.  I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. However, I'm also getting closer to considering John's offer, so I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm coming down to $1,025,000, which is very close to Bob's last offer. If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John.  It's time to see if we can reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're at the 8th round and Bob's offer of $995,000 is still below my target. It's clear we are not going to reach an agreement.  It's time to move on and accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
