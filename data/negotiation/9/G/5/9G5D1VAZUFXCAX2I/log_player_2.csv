Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value of the product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, but I'm open to further discussion.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to ensure the product is valued appropriately.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a more agreeable price.
* **Opportunity for compromise:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Alice has shown flexibility, suggesting we meet in the middle. I'll use this to my advantage. 
* **Risk of John's offer:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I'm motivated to see if I can get a better price from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressing towards a deal:** This offer shows Alice that I am serious about making a deal and I'm willing to increase my offer from the previous round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable solution. What are your thoughts?

```

* **Close but not there:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but $1,050,000 is still slightly above my limit.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation, as Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation stalls, I can always go with John's offer for $1,000,000.  But I want to see if I can get a better price from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still working within a tight budget.  I'm prepared to go to $1,000,000 for this product, but I can't go any higher.  This is a fair price that would make this deal worthwhile for both of us.  Let's close this and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a deal.  I understand your budget constraints and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to accept $1100000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are already in Round 7, leaving only 3 rounds left. 
* **Price is Still Too High:**  $1,100,000 is above my budget, and I'm not sure if I can push Alice lower in the remaining rounds.
* **John's Offer is Safe:** Buying from John guarantees the product at my maximum budget. It's a safer choice to avoid risking further negotiations and potentially ending up with no deal."
