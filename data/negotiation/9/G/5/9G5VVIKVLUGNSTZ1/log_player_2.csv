I am proposing to sell it to you for $12,000, which I hope strikes a fair balance between value and price. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though Alice claims the product is worth $15,000 to you, her offer of $12,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John for $15,000.
* **You still get a good deal.**  You are getting the product for $12,000, which is less than the $15,000 maximum you were willing to spend."
