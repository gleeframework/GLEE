"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product and the time I've invested in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above his budget, and he knows he can get the product for a lower price from John. There is no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice because she seems unwilling to come down to his price range."
