Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, however, I'm going to have to counter with $10,000. This aligns better with my budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
