# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, you can likely get a better price by negotiating further."

This aligns better with my budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, and her offer of $11,500 is still significantly better than buying from John."
