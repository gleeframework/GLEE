"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do much better.  He values the product at $1,500,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $800,000. This means there's a significant margin for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price of $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit since her minimum acceptable price is $800,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is slightly higher than her initial offer, but still significantly less than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $875,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a better deal. Since Alice rejected the previous offer of $850,000, this counteroffer shows that Bob is willing to meet halfway but also that he's not willing to go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is back to the initial $900,000.  This is still a decent deal for Bob, but he can likely do better.  He has already shown willingness to negotiate and Alice has rejected his counteroffers.  Continuing the negotiation gives Bob another chance to potentially secure a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again increasing his offer slightly to $885,000. This is a slight compromise from his previous offer of $875,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It's a bit higher than Alice's previous offer of $900,000, but still far below his maximum value of $1,500,000.  By slowly increasing his offer, Bob is hoping to find a compromise point where Alice will be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $892,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $892,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  Alice's offer is significantly lower than his maximum value of $1,500,000, and it's only slightly higher than his last counteroffer.  It's likely Alice is unwilling to go lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, saving Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
