"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to pay $13,200 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's finalize this deal.",13200.0,Bob,4,
