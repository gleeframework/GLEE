"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significant and $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $11,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
