Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'm offering for sale. I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which is a good strategy for building rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $90 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great product, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it for $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to $95, $92 is still a decent price and above my minimum.  It's not worth risking losing the deal altogether for a few more dollars."
