Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get the best possible price.  I'm aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,400,000. I want to show flexibility but still aim for a price closer to my initial asking price. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more flexible but also firm in my commitment to get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk losing a significant amount of money.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal, and I'm better off securing that than risking a lower offer from Bob."
