Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I believe it's of great value and you'll be very satisfied with it."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential to earn more than your fallback offer from John ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a profit significantly above your minimum.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While a higher price like $145 might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. $140 strikes a good balance between profit and the likelihood of acceptance."
