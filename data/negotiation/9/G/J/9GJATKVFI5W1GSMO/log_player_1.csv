I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed. It's also above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, ensuring I don't sell it for less than I'm comfortable with.  

I want to see how Bob responds to this offer before moving forward."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept $17,000 yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $18,500. This is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to accept $16,500 just yet. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $17,000. This is my final counteroffer, and it's closer to Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping that this will be a fair compromise and that Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'll go ahead and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I don't want to risk another round of negotiation and potentially getting a worse offer. John's offer is guaranteed, and it's important to me to secure the sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
