"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's settle this now.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit shy of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
