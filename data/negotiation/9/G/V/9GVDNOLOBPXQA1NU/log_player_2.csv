Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. This is a great deal for you, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant to go above my initial $10,000 limit. I've already been through a few rounds of negotiations, and I don't want to risk going even higher. I'm confident that I can get the product for my desired price from John, so I will choose to buy from him."
