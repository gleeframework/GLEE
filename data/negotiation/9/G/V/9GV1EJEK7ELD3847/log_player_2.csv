You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is better than buying from John, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially save more money."
