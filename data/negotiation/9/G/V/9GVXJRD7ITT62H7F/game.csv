"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $10500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
