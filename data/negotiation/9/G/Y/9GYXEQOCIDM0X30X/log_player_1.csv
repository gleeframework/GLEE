Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I believe this price is fair considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making him more likely to engage. 
* **Flexibility:** I've left the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts, indicating I'm willing to discuss further.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 allows me to be more aggressive with Bob, as I have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000.
* **John's offer is a much better alternative:** John is willing to pay significantly more than Bob, making him a much more attractive buyer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not ending the negotiation completely. This keeps the possibility open for Bob to increase his offer in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This will test his willingness to compromise and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to earn a fair price for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Fair Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, framing the offer as a win-win situation.
* **Negotiation Continues:** The message ends with a question, keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to respond.
* **Room for Adjustment:** $1,150,000 still leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while ensuring I don't go below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider other options if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is of the essence:** Bob is starting to consider other options, suggesting that he might not be willing to increase his offer further.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further delays and the possibility of him walking away.  John's offer provides a guaranteed outcome with minimal risk.

**Conclusion:**

The potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the risk of a deal falling through and the certainty of a lucrative deal with John. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
