,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I'm open to further discussion, but I can't go any lower than that.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is too low. How about $70? That's a fair offer considering I can buy it from someone else for $80.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $80? This seems like a fair compromise.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but $80 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. This is a fair price given the value of the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,7,
