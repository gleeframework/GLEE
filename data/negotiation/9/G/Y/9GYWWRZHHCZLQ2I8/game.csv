"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming to pay closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  I'm willing to offer you $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential profit you'll still make.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,250,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,275,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction quickly. Let me know what you think.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to accept $1,275,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,285,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1285000.0,Alice,5,
