Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving you significant costs in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm framing the offer by emphasizing the product's potential benefits to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
