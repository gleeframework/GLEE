"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $1,000,000. It's my maximum, and I'm confident this product is worth that much to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.
