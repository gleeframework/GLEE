"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at no less than $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $12000. This is my highest offer, and I'm hoping it's a good starting point for us. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14500.  This is a fair price that I think is within both of our budgets. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",14500.0,Bob,4,
