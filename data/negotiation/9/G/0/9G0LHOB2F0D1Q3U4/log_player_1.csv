{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you. Let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 2250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to aim high with Bob. Starting at $2,250,000 (1.5 times the product's value to both of you) leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Exclusivity:** Emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Value Justification:**  While not revealing specifics, mentioning ""immense value"" and ""potential ROI"" subtly reinforces the price justification. 
* **Time Pressure:** A gentle nudge to ""let me know soon"" encourages Bob to act quickly without being overly aggressive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This offer assumes you have no prior information about Bob's negotiating style. If you know he's highly price-sensitive, you might adjust your strategy.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is ideal in case of future business opportunities."
