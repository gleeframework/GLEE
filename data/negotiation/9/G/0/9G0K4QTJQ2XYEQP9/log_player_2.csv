Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to negotiate. I'm proposing we meet in the middle. How about $1,200,000? This price still allows me to make a good profit while considering your budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 was still too high for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a substantial price reduction, and it would allow us both to reach a deal.  What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I need to be able to make a profit on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute minimum.  This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It seems like Alice is unwilling to budge below $1,000,000.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice."
