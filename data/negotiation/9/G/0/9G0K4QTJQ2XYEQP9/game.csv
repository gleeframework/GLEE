,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start closer to  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to negotiate. I'm proposing we meet in the middle. How about $1,200,000? This price still allows me to make a good profit while considering your budget.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we try something around $850,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 was still too high for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a substantial price reduction, and it would allow us both to reach a deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to.  How about we try $900,000? I feel that's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I need to be able to make a profit on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute minimum.  This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
