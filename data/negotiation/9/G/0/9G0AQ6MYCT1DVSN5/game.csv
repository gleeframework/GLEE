"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
