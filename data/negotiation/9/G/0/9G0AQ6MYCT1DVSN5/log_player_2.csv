"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to him.  It's better than buying from John, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price."
