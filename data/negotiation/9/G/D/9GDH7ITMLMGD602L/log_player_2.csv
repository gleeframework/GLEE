# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is worth $1,000,000 to you.
