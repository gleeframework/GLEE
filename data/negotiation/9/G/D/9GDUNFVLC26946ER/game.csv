"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. It's a fair price that's closer to my original asking price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1100000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it also gives you a good return on your investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise.  $1075000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price within my budget.  How about $1000000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a solid investment.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still working within a tight budget.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows you to make a good profit and me to secure a valuable asset.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,8,
