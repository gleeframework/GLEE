"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,500.  Would you be open to that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
