"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12500 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $14000? It's a fair price that still allows me to cover my costs.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. $13500 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13750? This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,5,
