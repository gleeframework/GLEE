We're still leaving a lot of money on the table. While Bob is moving closer to our range, we have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose $1,230,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is clearly committed to negotiating and is now within $10,000 of our previous offer. Accepting at $1,230,000 ensures a very strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us needing to settle for John's $800,000 backup."
