"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're eager to share its benefits. For this round, let's start with a special introductory price of $100. We believe this is a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating. You are willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to pay closer to $90 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your feedback, I propose a price of $95 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise between our initial offers. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $95 is within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely you'll get much lower, and there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers or you'll run out of rounds.  Accepting the offer is the best option to get the product at a good price."
