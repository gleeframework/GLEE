Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? It's a fair price that gets us both closer to what we want."", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I've only got a few rounds left and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer or running out of time. John is a sure thing for $100, and that's a better guarantee than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
