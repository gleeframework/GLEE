You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his maximum budget while leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than his ideal price. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice is showing signs of flexibility. There's still room to bargain further, potentially getting closer to the $8,000 mark or at least securing a price lower than $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally raising his offer, showing Alice he is serious about purchasing the product while remaining within his budget.  This counteroffer is a good compromise and increases the chances of Alice accepting, especially as the negotiation progresses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a better deal. While Alice has lowered her price, it is still above Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation and Bob can aim to get closer to his $8,000 goal or at least secure a price lower than $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise but also highlights the gap between the two parties. It's a strategic move to see if Alice is ready to budge closer to Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has gone up, which is a bad sign for Bob. He's already rejected several offers, and Alice is now being more stubborn. With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob can get a better price from Alice. Buying from John is the best option at this point, as it guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price."
