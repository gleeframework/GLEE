"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm more comfortable in the $1,000,000 range. Would you consider an offer of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $1,400,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we try $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair offer, considering the market value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,150,000 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up that much margin. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make it worth my while. How about we try $1,320,000? It's a small step up from your last offer, but it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $1,320,000 is still pushing my budget. Would you consider $1,200,000? That's my best and final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to stay above $1,300,000. I'll meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,320,000, which is $1,260,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
