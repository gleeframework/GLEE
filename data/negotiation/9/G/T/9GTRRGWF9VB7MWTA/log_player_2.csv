Alice's offer is still too high, but closer to my budget.  I will reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."

While $950,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'll keep negotiating and see if I can get Alice down to a more reasonable price."

I'm going to try one more time to get Alice to come down to a price that's closer to my maximum.  $850,000 is a decent compromise and hopefully, she'll accept."

At this point, it's getting close to my maximum budget, and I'm not sure Alice is going to come down any further. Buying from John for $800,000 is the best option to save money and still get the product I need."
