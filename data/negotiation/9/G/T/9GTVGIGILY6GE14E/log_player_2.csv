**Reasoning:**

* **John's price is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $10,000 gives you leverage.

**Next Step:**  Make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your $8,000 limit."

* **Room for compromise:** This allows for potential compromise in future rounds.
* **Leverage:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $10,000 adds weight to your counteroffer.

* **Time is running out:** You only have 3 rounds remaining, and continuing to reject Alice's offers could lead to a situation where you're forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Need to compromise:** You need to find a price that both parties are comfortable with, and this might require making a counteroffer close to Alice's last offer.

**Next Step:**  Make a final counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price close to $9,800 to see if you can reach an agreement.  You need to weigh the risk of buying from John at a higher price against potentially getting a slightly better deal from Alice."
