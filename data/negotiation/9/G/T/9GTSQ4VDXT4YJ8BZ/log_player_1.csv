Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $19,500.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."",
""product_price"": 19500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, we don't know his absolute upper limit. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation or acceptance if his perceived value is higher.
* **Justification:** The message implies scarcity and value, which might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counter-offers."
