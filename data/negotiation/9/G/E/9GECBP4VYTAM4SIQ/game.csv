"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $680000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $720000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",720000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I've already compromised multiple times, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $690000. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at this price, but if not, I'll have to consider other options.",690000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I understand you've compromised a lot, but I'm still not comfortable with $690000. I'm willing to meet you at $680000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options.",680000.0,Bob,10,
