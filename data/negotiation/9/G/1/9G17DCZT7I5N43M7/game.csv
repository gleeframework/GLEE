"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $120 for it to make this worthwhile. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you and a fair price for me.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your budget, but I'm still unable to go below $110. It's a fantastic product and worth every penny. Let's see if we can find a compromise at $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $100. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
