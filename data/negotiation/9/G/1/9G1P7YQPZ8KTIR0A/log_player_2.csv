"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. I have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Targeting Below Value:**  My goal is to pay less than Alice values the product for, increasing the chance of her accepting.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm prepared to go higher if Alice rejects this initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room:** Alice came down from her initial offer, which is good. However, $85 is still closer to her value than mine.  There's room for further negotiation.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no rush to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between our last offers. This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Just Below Alice's Value:** Offering $78 keeps the price slightly below Alice's perceived value of $80, increasing the chances of her accepting. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will give me a better read on Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $82. It's still a good price for you, and it's the closest I can come to my minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $82 is a solid price, well below John's offer and a significant saving from Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited Upside:** While I might be able to negotiate a dollar or two less, the potential gain is small. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing too hard could lead Alice to walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
