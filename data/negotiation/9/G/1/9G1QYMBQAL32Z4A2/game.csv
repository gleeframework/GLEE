"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range.  To be honest, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $825,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'll counteroffer at $950,000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive support package and a 1-year warranty. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
