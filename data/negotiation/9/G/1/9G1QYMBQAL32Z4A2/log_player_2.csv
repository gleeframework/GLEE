"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both her value and my maximum price. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for this product."", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Not Too Low:**  While low, my offer is still above Alice's perceived value of the product, making it potentially appealing to her.
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves space for counter-offers and a potential compromise we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $950,000 is still too high. I'll aim to guide the negotiation closer to my desired range.  Alice seems motivated to sell, so I'm not overly concerned about scaring her off by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range.  To be honest, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $825,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 825000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump:** I've increased my offer by $125,000, demonstrating willingness to compromise and move towards a deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $825,000 is just above the midpoint between our last two offers, making it a strong negotiating position. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While I'm getting closer to my maximum, I don't want to concede too quickly. Alice might be willing to go even lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'll counteroffer at $950,000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive support package and a 1-year warranty. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's unwilling to budge from $950,000.  While the added extras are nice, they don't justify the price difference for me. I'm better off taking John's offer at $1,200,000.  It's higher than I wanted to spend, but still within my limit and avoids further unsuccessful negotiation with Alice."
