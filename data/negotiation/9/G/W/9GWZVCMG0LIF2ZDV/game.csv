"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's a fair price that's closer to both of our expectations.",12500.0,Alice,5,
