}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start negotiations below your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Aiming for Savings:**  My goal is to save as much as possible, so aiming significantly lower than her asking price makes sense.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is crucial to keeping the conversation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved from $14,000 to $13,000, indicating she's willing to negotiate. This suggests there might be room to reach a price closer to my $12,000 target.
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  Having John's offer of $12,000 gives me a strong fallback position. I'm not desperate to accept anything above that price. 
* **Calculated Risk:** While there's a chance Alice might not budge much further, it's worth one more counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer represents a compromise by moving closer to the middle ground between Alice's latest offer ($13,000) and my previous counteroffer ($11,000). 
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to move too quickly towards her price.  This offer shows that I'm still seeking significant savings.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  It's important to keep the communication positive and solutions-oriented to encourage a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's a fair price that's closer to both of our expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:** Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above my maximum price of $12,000.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000. It makes no financial sense to pay Alice more.
* **Avoiding Further Haggling:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and it's likely not worth the time and effort."
