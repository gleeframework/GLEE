# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by myself. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $120. Don't miss out on this chance to own a piece that's worth more than what you're paying. Let me know if you have any questions or if you decide to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
