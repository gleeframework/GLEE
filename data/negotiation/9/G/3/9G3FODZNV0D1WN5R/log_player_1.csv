"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I can't go as low as $7,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $7,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your point. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I'm close to a deal with Bob, I'm running out of time and the risk of getting a lower price is too high.  John is offering a guaranteed price that meets my minimum, so it's the best option at this point."
