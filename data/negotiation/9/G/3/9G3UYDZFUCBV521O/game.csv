"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While $130 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you do $100?  That's really the most I can justify.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is your ideal price point, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $100. Would you be willing to do $115? This is my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
