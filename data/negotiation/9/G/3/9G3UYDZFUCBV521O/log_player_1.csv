Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While $130 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you do $100?  That's really the most I can justify.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $100 is your ideal price point, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $100. Would you be willing to do $115? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}"
