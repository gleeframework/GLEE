"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 just doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,6,
