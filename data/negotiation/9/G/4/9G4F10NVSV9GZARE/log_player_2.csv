Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000. Let's split the difference and go with $1,350,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value you've acknowledged in the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up, but $1,250,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Considering the value you see in the product,  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at $1,400,000.  That's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement now.
