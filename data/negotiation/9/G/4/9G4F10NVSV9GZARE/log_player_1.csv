"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting high, but still within a range that could be appealing to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price with Bob. Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000. Let's split the difference and go with $1,350,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value you've acknowledged in the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from $1,350,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate further. I'm not willing to sell below $1,500,000 unless Bob makes a significant increase in his offer. Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up, but $1,250,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Considering the value you see in the product,  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at $1,400,000.  That's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement now."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've tried to negotiate with him, but he's not willing to go higher. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer is too high.  I'm going to sell to John and ensure I get my minimum profit."
