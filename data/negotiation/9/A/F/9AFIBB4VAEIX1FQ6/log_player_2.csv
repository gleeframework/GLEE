"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you and align with your needs and goals. This exceptional item is valued at $1,200,000 to you, and I am excited to offer it to you today. Considering its high value and unique features, I propose a purchase price of $1,100,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents an opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you have any questions or require further information to make an informed decision. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to facilitate this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, stating you value it at $1,200,000 when your maximum is $1,200,000. While her offer of $1,100,000 is less than your absolute limit, you can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer.  This opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or you can simply purchase from John at your maximum price."
