"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand the value, $8,500 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you consider $7,200?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,200 is still too far from what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",8000.0,Alice,5,
