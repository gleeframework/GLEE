Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1400000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,400,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1500000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I initially hoped for a higher price, Bob's offer matches the value John is willing to pay, and it ensures a quick and easy sale.  It's important to be pragmatic and recognize a good deal when it's presented."
