Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer and the potential value of the product, $15000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in exploring a price closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $9000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
