# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

This is a clear rejection of Alice's offer.  It's much higher than Bob's limit, so it makes sense to reject and counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Bob still wants to save as much as possible.  Alice's offer is still above his limit, so it makes sense to reject and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

While Alice has come down in price, she's still above Bob's maximum. At this point, it's clear that Alice won't go lower, so Bob is better off buying from John for his maximum price."
