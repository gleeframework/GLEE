"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $200?",200.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,180.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though! Would you be willing to pay $180 for the product?",180.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $150, which is a fair middle ground. Let's try to close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,170.0
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $30 yet. I'm willing to come down to $170, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, $170 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $160. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",160.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,165.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $160 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $165?",165.0,Alice,7,,
