Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. How about we agree on $1,325,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1325000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we make it work at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is the most strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  You're still making a $250,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob is clearly interested and incrementally increasing his offers. Holding out for more might push him away.
* **John as Backup:** While John offers $1,000,000, it's better to secure the higher profit now rather than risk losing Bob completely.
