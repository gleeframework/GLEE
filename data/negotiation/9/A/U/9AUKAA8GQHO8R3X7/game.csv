"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $675,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the market value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product for $660,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the market value.",660000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not convinced that $660,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $625,000 and $650,000, which is $637,500. However, I can go a bit lower than that and offer $620,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value.",620000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer the product for $640,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the market value. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",640000.0,Alice,7,
