Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to find a middle ground.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $1,250,000.  Let's split the difference and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

* **Close to your target:** $1,290,000 is only $40,000 above your desired $1,250,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions from Alice, but it also carries the risk of her becoming less flexible or the negotiation dragging on.
* **Time is a factor:** You only have three rounds left.  Accepting ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking losing the opportunity to a potentially better deal in the remaining rounds."
