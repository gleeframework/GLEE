"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1100000. It's a significant investment with a potential for high return, and I believe this price is fair considering its value to you.  Let me know your decision.  If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can secure the product from John for $1,000,000, saving him $100,000."
