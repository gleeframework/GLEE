Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential, I'm setting the price at $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is a strong offer that:
    * Offers Bob a substantial discount ($50,000) from your minimum.
    * Creates a sense of urgency with the ""limited-time"" element.
* **John as Leverage:** You don't explicitly mention John, keeping your fallback option confidential. 

This approach balances maximizing your potential profit from Bob while still ensuring you get your minimum price."
