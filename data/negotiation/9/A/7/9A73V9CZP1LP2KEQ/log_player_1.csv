"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, $900,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price close to my desired value. It's important to remember that Bob is willing to pay $800,000, so he may be interested in negotiating.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target price, I think I can still get a better deal. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and it's worth pushing for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $875,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering he's already offered $850,000. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's stuck at $850,000, and while that's better than John's offer, I still have time to try and get a higher price.  I have 6 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 865000}
```

I'm going to offer $865,000 to Bob. This is a smaller compromise than my previous counter-offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer. Hopefully, he'll see that I'm willing to negotiate and we can finally reach an agreement."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's lower than my previous counter-offer, I'm not desperate to sell and still have some rounds left.  I'm going to hold out for a better price, hoping Bob will eventually come back with a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to offer $850,000 to Bob.  It's a lower price than I'd like, but it's a compromise.  I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  I'm running out of time and Bob isn't willing to budge on his price.  While I'd prefer to get more, John's offer is at least close to my minimum value and guarantees me a sale.  I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it's clear we're not going to agree on a price.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John than risk losing out completely."
