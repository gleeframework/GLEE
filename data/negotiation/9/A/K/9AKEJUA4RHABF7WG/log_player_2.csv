While Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down a little more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is within my budget, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or I'll end up buying from John at a higher price. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
