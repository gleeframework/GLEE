"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $160, we're trying to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. This might make him more receptive to a slightly lower price later on. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer is also about gauging Bob's interest. His response will give us a better idea of his willingness to pay and how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($120).  We have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle. Selling to John right now would be the safe option, but we might be able to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm motivated to sell, $100 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're showing Bob that we're willing to negotiate by significantly dropping our price from $160 to $130.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering a price directly in the middle of our previous ask and his offer makes it seem like a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $130 is still above our minimum acceptable price, ensuring we make a profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $110. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's still interested.  While $110 is still below our ideal price, we're only $10 away from a price we'd accept.  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can bridge that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Bob. Let's make this easy for both of us - how about $120 and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're making it clear that this is our bottom line and we're not willing to go any lower.
* **Meeting Our Minimum:**  $120 represents the lowest price at which we're comfortable selling the product. 
* **Urgency:**  By proposing a price and saying ""we have a deal,"" we're introducing a sense of urgency, which might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still want the product. I'm willing to meet you at $115. Can you accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $115 is only $5 less than our ideal price. It's unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for the extra $5 risks losing the sale entirely. Bob might walk away, and we'd be left with the $120 offer from John, which is the same as our current option. 
* **Time Investment:**  We've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting a reasonable offer now saves time and allows us to move on."
