{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,150,000.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, offering $1,050,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This allows for a potential compromise that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's still some wiggle room. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,100,000. Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, you can try to meet her halfway. This counteroffer of $1,075,000 shows your willingness to compromise, but still leaves some room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,090,000, which is a good price for you, considering you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate may lead to a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price."
