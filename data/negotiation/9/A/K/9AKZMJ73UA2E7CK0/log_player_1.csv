Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a good price but also leaving room for negotiation.  $1,150,000 is a significant amount for Bob, but it's still below his estimated value, giving him an incentive to negotiate. I'm also keeping in mind the ""John"" option,  as a fallback in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While it's tempting to sell to him, I'm confident I can get closer to my goal through further negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."

I'm adjusting my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This counteroffer should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can get a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to close the remaining gap."
