""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's guaranteed price might entice Bob.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning she has another buyer, Alice subtly creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While aiming high, Alice leaves room for negotiation, which could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
