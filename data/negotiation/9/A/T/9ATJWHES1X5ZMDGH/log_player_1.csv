"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential benefit of the deal.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm prompting Bob to respond and start the conversation. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a back-and-forth negotiation. It also keeps the option of selling to John open if Bob's counteroffer isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Bob has indicated a willingness to negotiate, leaving room for a counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially reach a higher price. 

I'll proceed to round 3 with a counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise and keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness and win-win potential of the proposed deal.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm using language that invites further dialogue and negotiation.

This approach aims to continue the negotiation process and increase the chances of finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has again demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, suggesting there's still room for a higher offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a strong backup option, but I'm choosing to continue the negotiation with Bob to potentially reach a more favorable price. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in round 5 to see if we can bridge the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm proposing a small increase from Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still seeking a higher price.
* **Fair middle ground:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and seeking a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm again using an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially lead to a quicker agreement. 

This counteroffer maintains my leverage while also showing flexibility and potentially leading to a successful negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 is still a bit too far from where I need to be. Let's split the difference and settle on $10,150.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates a genuine effort to find common ground and reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm again emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of equity and encouraging a positive outcome for both parties.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm prompting Bob to respond and potentially move the negotiation forward.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $10,150, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm getting closer to my limit of 10 rounds.
* **Insufficient progress:**  While Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, his offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit for me and ensures that I won't lose out on a potentially better deal. 

It's important to remember that my goal is to earn as much as possible, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. Selling to John provides a reliable and profitable solution."
