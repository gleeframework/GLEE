"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I can do $85, which is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $77?",77.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $77. I can do $82.50, which is a bit closer to the original price, but still a fair compromise.",82.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting a bit drawn out.  I'm willing to offer $79, but that's my final offer.",79.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $82, but that's as low as I can go.",82.0,Alice,7,
