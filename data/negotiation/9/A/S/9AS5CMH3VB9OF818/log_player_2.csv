"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm looking to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll appreciate its value and I look forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better price by counteroffering.  There's room to negotiate since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him and only $800,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's a good deal for him, allowing him to save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's still room for negotiation, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of Alice walking away and him having to buy from John at a much higher price."
