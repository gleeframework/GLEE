"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a significant value, and it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $775,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your effort.  However, $775,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To show you my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to go down to $825,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
