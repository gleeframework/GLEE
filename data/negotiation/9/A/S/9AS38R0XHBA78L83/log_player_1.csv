{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially offering it at $750,000. Let me know what you think, this offer won't be on the table for long."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, it's always good to start negotiations a bit higher to allow room for negotiation. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning that the offer won't last long adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value, we give the impression of a deal while still leaving room for potential counter-offers that could land us closer to $800,000.

**Important Note:**  Even though we have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's always better to try and secure the highest possible price from Bob first."
