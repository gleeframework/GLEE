I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm confident that I can negotiate down if necessary, and I'm always prepared to sell to John for $15,000 as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum, so I'm not willing to accept it yet. I will try to get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is higher than my minimum value and a good compromise considering the back-and-forth.  It's worth accepting to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
