"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a fair price considering the value to both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000? This would be a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
