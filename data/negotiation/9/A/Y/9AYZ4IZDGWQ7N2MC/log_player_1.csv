{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price point that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This allows for some room for negotiation and potentially finding a price that satisfies both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $80 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $95? "", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my $120 threshold.  I'm confident that John will buy it for the full price, so it's better to move on and avoid further negotiation."
