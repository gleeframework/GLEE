{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He wants to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is still too high. He has time to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate lower. He's already shown a willingness to pay close to $10,000, so there's room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering your desire to sell and my budget limitations. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's very close to his desired price point, and there's still room for negotiation. He's shown a willingness to pay $10,000, so he can likely push for a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go to $10,250. This is really pushing my budget, but I'm confident this product is worth it to me. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're willing to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for less than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. He's already gone back and forth with Alice multiple times, and Alice is unwilling to budge below $11,000. This price is still too high for Bob, and he's already made it clear that he's willing to pay $10,250.  There's no guarantee that he'll be able to get a better deal with Alice in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the product from John at a price he's comfortable with."
