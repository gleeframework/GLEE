"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a relatively high starting point, but it allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product. However, if he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer and potentially even sell to John for $150 if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $180. While it's closer to my minimum value of $150, I believe I can still secure a better price. I'm going to counter-offer in the next round and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter-offer with $190. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a profit margin for myself. I hope this will be agreeable to Bob, as it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential of selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $185. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $185
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $185.  While I was hoping for a bit more, this is a good price and I'm getting closer to my goal of maximizing profit. It's also risky to keep negotiating, as I might end up selling to John for less.  It's time to close the deal!"
