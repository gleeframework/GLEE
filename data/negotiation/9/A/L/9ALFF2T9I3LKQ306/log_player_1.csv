It's getting close to the end of the negotiations and while I am hopeful that I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable value, and I can't risk going below that.  Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John."
