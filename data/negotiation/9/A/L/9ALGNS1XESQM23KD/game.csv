"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
