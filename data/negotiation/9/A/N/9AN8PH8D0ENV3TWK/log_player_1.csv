Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price, especially since we have a few rounds left.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate it. However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a good opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a great price. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with $12,250, it's getting close to my minimum price and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and being stuck with John's offer of $10,000. I'll take the $12,250 and consider it a win."
