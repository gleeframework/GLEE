"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $75?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85?  Let's meet in the middle.",85.0,Alice,3,
