"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and you'll be getting it for a significant markup. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $1,350,000 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to drop to $1,400,000 as a final compromise.  This price still leaves some room for you to benefit from the product's value, and it allows me to secure a fair return. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is the highest price I can reasonably pay and still get a good return on my investment.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
