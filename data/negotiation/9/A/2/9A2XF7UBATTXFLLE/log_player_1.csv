We're still a ways off from a desirable price. Let's see if Bob is willing to move closer to $1 million."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It seems unlikely Bob will budge much beyond $980,000.  While that's a decent price, accepting a lower offer now sets a precedent for future negotiations. It's time to move on to John who is offering a full $1,200,000."
