"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be motivated to buy at this price as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $100 is too low for me, as it's below my minimum value.  I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130. It's a compromise,  higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. I believe this might be a good middle ground for us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I would like, it's only $5 below my minimum value, and we are already halfway through our negotiation rounds. It's better to accept this offer than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for my minimum value."
