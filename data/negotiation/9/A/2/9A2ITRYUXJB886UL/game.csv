"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value, considering my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above this price. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Considering its potential and long-term value, I'm proposing $1,650,000. I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still feel that $1,650,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
