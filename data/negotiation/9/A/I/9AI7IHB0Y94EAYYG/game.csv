"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $107.50? Can you do that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $109? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $108? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there.",108.0,Bob,6,
