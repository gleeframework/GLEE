We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room to negotiate with Bob.  Let's see if we can push a bit further."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.

Bob is clearly hesitant to go higher, and while we could try to push for a bit more,  $880,000 is a strong offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us having to settle for John's offer later."
