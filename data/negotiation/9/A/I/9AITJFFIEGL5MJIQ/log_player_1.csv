"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000, which reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's work together to find a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I want to maximize my profit and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to negotiate further."

Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
