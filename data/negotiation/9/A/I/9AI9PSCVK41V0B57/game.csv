"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! While I understand your offer, $200 is quite a drop.  How about we meet in the middle at $170? That's a much fairer price.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $170 is still a bit high for me. How about $110? I'm trying to stick to a budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $110 is still a bit low for what I can do, but I'm happy to come down a bit more. How about $150 and we have a deal?",150.0,Alice,5,
