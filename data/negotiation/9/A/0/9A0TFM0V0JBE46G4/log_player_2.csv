"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price that's still fair for both of us. Would you be interested in paying $120 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer is significantly higher than her perceived value of the product ($80).  You have some bargaining power here."
