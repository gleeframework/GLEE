Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at this price point ensures you earn substantially more than your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay.  It aims for a strong opening offer based on the available information."
