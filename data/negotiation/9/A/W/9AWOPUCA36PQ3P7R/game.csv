"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $980000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm now offering the product to you for $1060000, which is actually my previous offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I hope you can see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price.",1060000.0,Alice,7,,
