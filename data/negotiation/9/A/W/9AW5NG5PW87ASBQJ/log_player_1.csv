Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.

I'm aiming for a higher price, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
