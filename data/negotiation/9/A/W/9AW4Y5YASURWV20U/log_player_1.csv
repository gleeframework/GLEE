Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $900,000. This aligns more closely with what I can afford. I hope we can reach an agreement.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, we still have room to negotiate and time before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We're getting close, but I think there's still room to encourage Bob to go a bit higher. It's worth another counter-offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to make this deal happen. How about we settle at $1,160,000?  That's a strong show of good faith on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $1,140,000. This is my final offer, as it is still within my budget constraints while acknowledging the value of the product. I hope we can reach a mutual agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,140,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob has signaled that $1,140,000 is his final offer. While we've made progress in the negotiation, it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. I'm confident in John's offer and selling for $1,500,000 is a better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob."
