``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $2,000 above your maximum budget. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're confident in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  $10,500 is my best price, considering the value of the product.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. 
* There's still room for negotiation, and you want to see if you can get a better deal.
* Buying from John would be a safe option, but you might be able to save a little more by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's be realistic - this product is worth $10,000 to you, and it's worth $10,000 to me. It's a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 10000}
