"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're confident in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's be realistic - this product is worth $10,000 to you, and it's worth $10,000 to me. It's a win-win situation.",10000.0,Bob,4,
