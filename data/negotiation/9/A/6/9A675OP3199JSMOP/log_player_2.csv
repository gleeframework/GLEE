"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $90, which is still more than your maximum budget.
* You can get the same product from John for $100.

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John and stay within your budget."
