"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $700,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to budge.  $650,000 is still a good price for the product, and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $675,000, which is a good price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John is high.  I'm happy to accept this offer and save $125,000."
