"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $12,000. Considering this, I propose a special introductory offer of $10,500 for you. This price reflects the significant discount compared to its market value while still allowing me to earn a fair profit. I trust this offer will be mutually beneficial and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,500 is still significantly higher than her own valuation of $8,000. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price.
* While you'll likely end up buying from John for $12,000, there's a chance Alice might counter-offer with a lower price to avoid losing the sale completely. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Alice closer to her own valuation. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation."
