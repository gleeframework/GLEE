"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so you can likely get it for less than $9,500. It is worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than her estimated value for the product, and you can likely negotiate a lower price.  It's worth trying to push for a price closer to your ideal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $10,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and my original offer of $10,000. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you can keep negotiating, Alice's offer of $9,750 is a reasonable compromise and gets you the product for a price that's still lower than John's offer of $12,000. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
