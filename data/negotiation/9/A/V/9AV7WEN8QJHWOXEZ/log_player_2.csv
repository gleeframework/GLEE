Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $145. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $145 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to come down a bit more. I can offer the product to you for $130. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?
