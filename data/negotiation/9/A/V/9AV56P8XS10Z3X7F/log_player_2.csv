It's time to cut bait and switch to John.  Alice is clearly not budging towards a reasonable price.  She's gone backwards in the negotiation, and with only one round left, it's highly unlikely she'll suddenly drop to a price I'm willing to accept.  While buying from John means spending more than I hoped, it's better than risking a stalemate with Alice and potentially ending up with nothing."
