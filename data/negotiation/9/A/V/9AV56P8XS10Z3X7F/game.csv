"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. Could we settle on $775,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to drop the price to $825,000, which is closer to your desired range. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something under $800,000.  Would you consider $790,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $815,000, which is still a bit above your desired range, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",815000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close.  I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to budge a bit more. How about $805,000? That's a significant compromise on my end, and I think it represents a good deal for both of us.",805000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $805,000 and my original price of $900,000. I'm offering the product to you for $852,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",852500.0,Alice,9,
