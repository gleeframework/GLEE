"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You know you can get the product from John for $100, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price.  Rejecting her offer doesn't mean you're giving up on getting a deal, it just means you're holding out for a better price."
