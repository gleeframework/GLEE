"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I think this price is more reasonable considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $950000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your final decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
