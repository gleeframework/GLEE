Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit. Bob gets a small discount, motivating him to buy, and you make a significant profit above your minimum.

**Why not other prices?**

* **Lower Prices (e.g., $100-$139):**  While ensuring a sale, you leave potential profit on the table. 
* **Higher Prices (e.g., $141-$150):** You risk Bob rejecting the offer and you having to settle for $100 from John. 
 
Let's see what Bob says!"
