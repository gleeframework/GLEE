"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is too low for me at this point, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,750. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's split the difference and settle at $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and it's my final offer.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'm counteroffering at $8,750. This is my last offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a price closer to my desired value. It seems like Bob is unwilling to go higher. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
