"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price. It's possible Alice is willing to go lower to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 17.6% discount from Alice's initial price. This aggressive approach is meant to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially push her to a more reasonable price. The $700,000 offer still leaves room for further negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is better than her initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to try and get an even lower price, aiming for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $700,000. It's worth trying another counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway by offering a price slightly higher than his previous counteroffer. This shows that he's willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price. The $725,000 offer is a reasonable compromise, leaving space for Alice to accept or counter with a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $735,000 is only $10,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  It's unlikely Alice will go lower at this point, and continuing to negotiate could risk her walking away from the deal completely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a significantly lower price than John's offer, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the back-and-forth negotiation."
