"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me.  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $82 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy the product at that price.",80.0,Bob,4,
