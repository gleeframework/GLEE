"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10000? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to work within your budget. In light of this, I am prepared to consider a compromise. I would like to offer the product at a price of $10500. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your financial constraints.
