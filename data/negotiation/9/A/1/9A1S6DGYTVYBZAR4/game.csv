"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $13,500 for this product.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be.  How about $13,250?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay.  What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,
