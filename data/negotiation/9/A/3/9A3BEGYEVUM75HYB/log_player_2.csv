You can do better than $1,000,000.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a good price for you, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While $950,000 is closer to your target, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I understand your need to stay under $900,000, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000? This is a fair price that considers both our positions and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

Alice is now at $975,000, and you're looking to stay under $900,000. There's likely not enough wiggle room to reach an agreement that works for both of you. It's better to go with John at this point, as he's offering a price within your budget."
