,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a good price for you, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000.  However, I'm still looking to stay under $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I understand your need to stay under $900,000, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000? This is a fair price that considers both our positions and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen!",975000.0,Alice,5,
