Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** My message highlights the value of the product to both of us. This can build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A $1,000,000 offer gives Bob room to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer, always keeping my minimum price in mind. 
* **If the negotiation drags on:** I'll  consider selling to John, as he offers my minimum price and ensures a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is showing interest and acknowledges the product's value, indicating a potential for a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed option:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is safe, I want to explore if I can get closer to that price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my target price, but still leaving room for compromise. I'll aim for a price between $950,000 and $1,000,000.
* **Closely Monitor the Negotiation:**  I'll track how far Bob is willing to go and be prepared to either accept a reasonable offer or move on to John if the negotiation stalls."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a good price for you, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  My counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, signaling my willingness to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter again, always keeping my minimum price in mind.
* **Selling to John:** If negotiations stall, I'll consider selling to John to avoid further delays and secure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000.  However, I'm still looking to stay under $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  The negotiation is showing progress, with Bob coming up in his offer. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, costing me time and potentially a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll be more firm. I'll aim for a price between $975,000 and $1,000,000.  This shows I'm serious about getting closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John:**  I'm prepared to sell to John if this counteroffer is rejected.  The potential gains from further negotiation are diminishing, and I don't want to risk losing the guaranteed sale to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand your need to stay under $900,000, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000?
