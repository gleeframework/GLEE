"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below my expectations for this product.  It represents a considerable investment on my part, and I need to see a return that reflects its true worth. How about we settle on $1,700,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
