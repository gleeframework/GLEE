"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $600,000 is lower than my initial price, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and provides you with a significant opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm eager to work with you, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?",750000.0,Alice,5,
