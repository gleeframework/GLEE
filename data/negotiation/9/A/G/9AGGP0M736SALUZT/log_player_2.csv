"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really like. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  Would you be interested in buying it for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Buying from Alice for $90 is a better deal than buying from John for $100.  Even though it's closer to your maximum price point, you still save $10."
