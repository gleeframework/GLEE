Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""What do you think?"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just giving a flat rejection. 

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice still has John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000."
