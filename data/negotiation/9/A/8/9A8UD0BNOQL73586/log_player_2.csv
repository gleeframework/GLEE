Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you think it's impressive. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from this product and is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is likely very attached to getting at least $1,300,000 and is unlikely to budge much further.  We have a guaranteed option with John for $1,200,000 which meets our needs and saves us money."
