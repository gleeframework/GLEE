This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum, but I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer.  I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below $1,500,000 as that's my minimum."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
