Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $11,500 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It clearly states the price and leaves the door open for further discussion. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations.  Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if you don't get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below your desired price point.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to your goal of $11,500.  You should make a counteroffer to see if you can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about $10,800?  That's a decent compromise, and it would allow me to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to your desired price point of $11,000. Accepting this offer allows you to maximize your profit while still getting a good deal for yourself.  It's also worth noting that further negotiation might not get you a significantly higher price, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
