Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would theoretically benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a balanced approach:

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value proposition"" to emphasize its desirability.
* **Confident Price:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **No Justification:** Avoid justifying the price upfront. Let Bob respond and reveal his hand first.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be ready with alternative prices or potential compromises. 
* **Don't Reveal Your Hand:** Never tell Bob your minimum price or about your deal with John.
* **Consider Bob's Perspective:**  Think about why this product is valuable to Bob and tailor your message accordingly.

This strategy maximizes your chances of a profitable sale while maintaining a professional and respectful negotiation with Bob."
