{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you. I'm offering it for $150. It's worth every penny and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate downwards.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value to entice Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still significantly higher than your minimum value, so there's room to negotiate further.  It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? This is still a great deal for such a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $135 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $5 below your previous offer, and it's still significantly higher than your minimum value. It's a good deal, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether. Accepting his offer is the best choice in this situation."
