Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $1,100,000 given its value proposition.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Negotiation Space:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
