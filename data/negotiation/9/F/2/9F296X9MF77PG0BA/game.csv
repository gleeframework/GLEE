"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $170 for it. Can you consider my offer?",170.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $170 is still a bit low for me.  How about $185?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",185.0,Alice,3,

I understand that $185 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $177.50. Can you consider this compromise?,177.5,Bob,4,
