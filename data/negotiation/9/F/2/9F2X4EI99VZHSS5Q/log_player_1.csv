Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise. It's lower than my minimum value of $15,000 but still higher than Bob's value of $10,000. This gives Bob a good incentive to buy while still ensuring I make a profit if he doesn't.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
