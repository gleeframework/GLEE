"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,000,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and willing to increase his offer.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but I'm hoping for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has offered $850,000, which is significantly closer to my desired price point than his previous offers.  It's also more than I would get from John. Accepting this offer means I'm securing a good deal and ending the negotiation successfully."
