Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($120) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $80, so you need to offer a price that's attractive but still profitable for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, acting as your safety net.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested while still securing a significant profit for you."
