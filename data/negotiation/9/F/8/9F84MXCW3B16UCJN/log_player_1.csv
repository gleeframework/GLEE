"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also highlights the value of the product to create some urgency. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a price that is closer to my minimum value, aiming to secure a good deal early on. However, I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob counteroffers. I'll also keep in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000, and I'm confident I can get it through further negotiation.  It's also too early to sell to John, as I might be able to get a better price from Bob with a little more negotiating. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to meet halfway. I'll still be willing to negotiate but will be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be well worth it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a compromise price, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still higher than his perceived value but gives him a chance to get the product for a price that's closer to his expectations.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and reinforces the value of the product. I'm trying to make him feel like we're working together to find a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to reach an agreement quickly. While $12,000 is lower than my ideal, it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
