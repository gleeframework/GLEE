"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for us both to gain from the transaction. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
