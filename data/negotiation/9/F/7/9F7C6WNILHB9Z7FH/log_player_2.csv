"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to open with a counteroffer significantly below your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important for a positive outcome. 
* **Leaving Room to Move Up:** While my counteroffer is substantially lower, it's crucial to remember that I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000. I've left myself plenty of room to negotiate upwards if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for us both to gain from the transaction. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $1,300,000 is still a considerable distance from my target price. I want to see if I can negotiate further before settling. There's still a decent margin between this offer and John's price, so I'm comfortable continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price directly in the middle of our previous offers. This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Targeting My Ideal Price:**  My offer of $1,200,000 aligns with my goal of securing the best possible price.  
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  While this is my target, I'm still open to slight adjustments if necessary to close the deal."
