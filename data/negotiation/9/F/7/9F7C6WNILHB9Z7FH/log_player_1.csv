{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,450,000 is comfortably above your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a decent profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him some room to negotiate if he wants to. This could lead to a faster agreement.
* **It sets a strong initial position:** By starting higher, you establish a baseline that Bob will have to come down from if he wants to make a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, and it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price. You should reject the offer and send a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for us both to gain from the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
