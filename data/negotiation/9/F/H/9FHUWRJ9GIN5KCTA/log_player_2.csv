Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $122. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is offering a price that's a good deal below your maximum. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
