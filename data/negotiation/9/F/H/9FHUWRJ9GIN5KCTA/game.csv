"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down a bit on the price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $122. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.",122.0,Alice,5,
