"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob is trying to save money, it's logical to reject Alice's initial offer and see if he can get a lower price.  There's no immediate advantage to buying from Alice or John at this point, as both are offering the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiation and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  This counteroffer is also within Bob's budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to John's offer.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price, and the risk of losing the product to another buyer is increasing."
