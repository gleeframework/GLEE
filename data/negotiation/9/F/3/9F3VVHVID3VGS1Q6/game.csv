"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. Considering the product's value to me is no less than $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $11000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the research you've done and the value you see in the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
