"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to Alice, so she's willing to take a lower price. It's worth $150 to me, but I can try to negotiate a better price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the quality of the product, but $145 is a bit steep for me. How about $135? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 is too low for me. Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $140, which is still within my budget and a better price than John's offer. It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept."
