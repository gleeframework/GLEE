"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my maximum budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident that this price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's make a deal!",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal!",1025000.0,Alice,5,
