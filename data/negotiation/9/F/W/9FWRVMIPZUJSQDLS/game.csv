"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the effort I've put into it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would allow me to purchase the product within my budget and give you a fair price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,075,000? I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
