Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $12,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John). 
* **Confident but not Greedy:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value while still acknowledging Bob's perspective and inviting a discussion. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
