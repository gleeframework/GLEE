,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need to stay closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's compromise at $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle at $870,000.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",870000.0,Alice,5,
