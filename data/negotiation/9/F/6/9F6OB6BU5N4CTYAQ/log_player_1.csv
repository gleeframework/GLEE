"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that can significantly benefit your business. This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value before accepting.  Selling to John is always an option if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen, I believe it can be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, and I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  However, if Bob doesn't budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise, considering the value of this product. I'm confident this deal can be mutually beneficial. Let's find common ground and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $940,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiations have stalled. Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and his offer of $920,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  With only four rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob.  It's best to take the guaranteed offer from John and secure a price that meets my needs."
