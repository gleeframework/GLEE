"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as it aligns with my maximum spending limit. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. I could be willing to let it go for $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
