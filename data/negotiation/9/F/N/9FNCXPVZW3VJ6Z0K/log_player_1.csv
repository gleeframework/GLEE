Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.

* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter-offer.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll closely analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself. I'll also consider the time remaining and whether it's more beneficial to close the deal with John or continue negotiations with Bob."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiations. I need to make a decision, and I only have two options: accept Bob's offer or sell to John.
* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $20,000 below my minimum acceptable price. While not ideal, it's still a significant profit.
* **Uncertainty with John:** There's no guarantee that John will still be interested in buying the product, especially if he knows I'm negotiating with Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, even if it's slightly below my desired price. Rejecting it might lead to no sale at all. 

**Conclusion:** Given the limited time and the risk of losing the deal altogether, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale for $1,320,000."
