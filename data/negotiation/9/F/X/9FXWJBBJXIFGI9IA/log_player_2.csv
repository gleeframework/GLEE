# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to you ($130 vs. $150 maximum).**  
* **There's potential for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
