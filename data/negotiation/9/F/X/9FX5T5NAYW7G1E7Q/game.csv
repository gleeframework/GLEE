"Alice,  I appreciate you offering the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
