"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to get a deal done."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you offering the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price:** $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000 than his previous offer of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While further negotiations are possible, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves $200,000 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice at this point, as it secures a good deal with minimal risk of losing the opportunity."
