"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $800000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true potential. Let's work together to make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
