I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me some room to negotiate while still making more than my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise and meets my minimum goal of making at least $150. I'll accept it."
