"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at a price that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and still above my minimum price.  I hope this shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I've already had two rounds of negotiation. It seems like Bob is not willing to pay significantly more.  Given that I have John as a guaranteed buyer at this price, it's safer to sell to him now and avoid further risk of getting a lower price from Bob."
