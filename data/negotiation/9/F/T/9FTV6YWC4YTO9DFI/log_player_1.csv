Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (But Not Too Much):** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price from John ($1,500,000) leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still ensuring you get a great deal.
* **Maximizing Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the $1,400,000 offer, you make a significant profit over his perceived value and exceed what John would pay.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price enticing to Bob and one that secures a substantial profit for you."
