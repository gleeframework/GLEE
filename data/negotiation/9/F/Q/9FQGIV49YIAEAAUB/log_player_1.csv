Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This is a starting point for the negotiation.  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential compromise and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the gap and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate, while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's just slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but higher than Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's fair for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation has reached a point where the gap between our prices is too wide to bridge in a reasonable number of rounds.  Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate would likely result in a lower price for me. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's the best option to maximize my earnings."
