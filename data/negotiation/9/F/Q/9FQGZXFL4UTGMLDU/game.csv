I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make a deal at $150?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to come down to that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you in the middle at $125. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $125 is closer, but I'm still a bit tight on my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go that low, Bob. I can offer you a compromise at $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $130 is still a bit too much for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $115? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can offer you $128, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think we can make it work.",128.0,Alice,7,
