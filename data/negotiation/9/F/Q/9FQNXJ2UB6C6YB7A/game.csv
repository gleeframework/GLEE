"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe it's worth that price. Can we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 undervalues the product's true worth, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $10,500? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. I'm thinking $9,000 is a fair price for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your business and want to find an agreement. Let's split the difference between our last offers and settle at $9,750. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from $9,750. I'm willing to pay $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,6,
