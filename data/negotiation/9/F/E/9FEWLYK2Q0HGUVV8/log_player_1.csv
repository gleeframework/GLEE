Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."

I'm counteroffering with $840,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to persuade him to close the deal. I'm also aware that we are approaching the final rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."

With only 2 rounds left and Bob refusing to budge much further, I'm going to sell to John. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely with Bob. Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
