"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $10000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  He can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. I believe this price is fair considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price point.  While it's a step in the right direction, Bob still has some room to negotiate. It's better to try to get a lower price rather than accepting an offer that is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,500. This offer reflects the value I place on the product and represents a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. There is still room to negotiate further, and Bob wants to continue exploring the possibility of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my last offer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to try to get a deal done. I'm now offering the product to you for $10250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still a bit higher than what Bob wants to pay. It's a good sign that Alice is willing to keep negotiating, so Bob should continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Let's split the difference and meet at $9,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round of negotiation with Alice, and while Bob prefers a lower price, $10,000 is a good deal considering his maximum budget of $12,000.  He's already rejected a lower offer of $9,750 from Alice, and there's a risk that if he rejects this offer, Alice will stick to her price, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John for $12,000.  Therefore, it's wiser to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's still within his budget."
