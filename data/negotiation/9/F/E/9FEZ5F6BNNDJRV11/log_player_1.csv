Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good deal.  I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than my minimum, it's still below my initial target. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000, which is still above Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This price gives Bob a good reason to accept, while still getting me a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my desired price range, and I'm confident that I can't get a much better deal.  It's getting close to my minimum value, and I'm willing to settle for this offer rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price or having to sell to John."
