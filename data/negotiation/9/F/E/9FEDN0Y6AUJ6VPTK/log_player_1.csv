{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I've also added a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $12,000, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's too far below my desired value.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,500 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'd like to make a deal that works for both of us. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000, it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept this offer since it's within a reasonable range and avoids the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer. It's also a good compromise that allows for a quick close."
