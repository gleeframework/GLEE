"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer it to you for $13,250. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still potential to get a better price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $12,875?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer it to you for $13,187.50. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,187.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,187.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,187.50 is still slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $12,875. However, considering that Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and John is selling the product for that amount, it's a good deal for Bob.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but it risks losing the deal to John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price significantly lower than John's, saving him a considerable amount of money."
