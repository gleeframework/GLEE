Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $12,000 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $3,000) while allowing you to earn a significant profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and a price that maximizes your potential earnings."
