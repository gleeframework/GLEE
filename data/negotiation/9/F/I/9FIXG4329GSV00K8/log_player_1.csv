"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. My price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) but still within a range that Bob might consider, considering the product is worth $80 to him. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price, which allows for flexibility and potential compromise in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $85 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is above my minimum acceptable price, I'm aiming for a higher return.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob before considering selling to John.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price.  
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive to maintain a good relationship with Bob.
* **Meeting in the middle:** $95 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $90.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and represents a good compromise.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and there's a chance Bob might walk away if I reject his offer.  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I'm comfortable closing the deal with Bob at this price."
