"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to start at $140. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should aim to get closer to our $120 limit.  Buying from John right away is possible, but we might get a better deal with Alice if we negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a polite and interested tone to keep the negotiation amicable.  
* **Not Too Low:** While we start low, $100 is still a reasonable amount and shows we're serious about purchasing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to our desired price, but it's still above what John offers. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to $120 before considering Alice's offer or John's alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I have a strict budget. Could we make it work at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also holding our ground.
* **""Strict Budget""**: Mentioning a budget can sometimes encourage the seller to be more flexible.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us in the negotiation while still aiming for a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. Let's try $120 as the final price for the product. This still gives us some room for future transactions if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched John's price of $120. There's no further benefit to negotiating, as we've reached the best possible deal. Accepting now secures the product at the desired price."
