"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I don't want to immediately sell to John, I need to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is far below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1200000, which is $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price,  $950,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can close the deal this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still not in line with the value of this product. I'm willing to make one last concession.  Let's settle on $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to acquire a truly valuable asset. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $980000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're running out of rounds. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  John is a safe option at $1,000,000."
