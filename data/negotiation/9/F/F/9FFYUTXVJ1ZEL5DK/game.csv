"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product right now. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal, but I'm not ready to let it go that cheap. Considering our initial conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not ready to let it go. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,800. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
