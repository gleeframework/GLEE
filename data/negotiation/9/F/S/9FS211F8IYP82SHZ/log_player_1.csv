{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $110.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

While $110 is more than what John would pay, it's still less than what I'd ideally like to get.  I'll try to counteroffer Bob and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  That way we're both getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
