"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too high for me. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $860,000, which is closer to your value of $800,000 and also closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $880,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $870,000, which is a fair compromise.
