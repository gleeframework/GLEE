The product is too expensive at $1,500,000, exceeding your budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, and hopefully, it will encourage her to negotiate seriously."

While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target."

I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm serious about buying but still trying to get a better price."

Alice is getting closer to my price, but it's still a bit higher than my desired price. I'm going to go ahead and buy from John for $1,200,000.  While it's not the absolute best deal, it's within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
