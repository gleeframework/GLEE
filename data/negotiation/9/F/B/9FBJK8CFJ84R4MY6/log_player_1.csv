This is a starting point, and I'm aiming for a significantly higher profit than my minimum acceptable price. It's a bold offer, but I'm confident in the product's value. Let's see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than John's offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but still want to ensure a profit.  $1,300,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's low offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what John is offering. I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer but still above John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway to secure this deal. $1,175,000 is a reasonable compromise and still above what I can get from John.  Let's see if this is acceptable to Bob."
