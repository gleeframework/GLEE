Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find the value to him to be high enough to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $12,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my original offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000,  $11,000 is still a good price and more than what I could get from John.  There's a chance Bob might reject a further counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing him completely."
