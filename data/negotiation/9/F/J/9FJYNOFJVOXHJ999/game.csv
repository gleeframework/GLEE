"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price.  How about we split the difference and go with $10000?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, so I'm counteroffering $11000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,5,
