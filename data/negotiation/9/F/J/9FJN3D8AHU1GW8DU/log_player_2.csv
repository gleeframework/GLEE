Considering its high value and quality, I propose a special introductory price of $140 for you. This is an excellent opportunity to experience the benefits of our product at a competitive rate. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $150. Alice's offer is $140, which is less than your maximum but still more than the product is worth to Alice ($120).  Since you can get the product from John for $150, it's more beneficial to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This way, you pay the most you're willing to pay and still get the product."
