"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you at a price I believe is fair, considering its potential.  While I can't disclose the details of the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is an opportunity you won't want to miss.  Let me know if you're interested in learning more, and we can discuss the price further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is asking for $1,500,000, which is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, this doesn't necessarily reflect its true market value.  It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget."
