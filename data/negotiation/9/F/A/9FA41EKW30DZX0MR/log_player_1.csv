"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's better to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still room for a better price.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we try $7,000? That's a significant step up from my last offer and puts us closer to a win-win. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired outcome.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my valuation of $8,000.  There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that feels too low just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer of $7,000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $8,000.  How about we settle on $7,500?  This would split the difference and ensure both of us get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $7,250?  It seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,250 is tempting, I'm running out of rounds.  With only four rounds remaining, I'm concerned that further negotiation might not lead to a significantly higher price.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a quick and secure transaction."
