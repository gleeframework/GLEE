"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and what I'm looking for.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $700000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $750000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
