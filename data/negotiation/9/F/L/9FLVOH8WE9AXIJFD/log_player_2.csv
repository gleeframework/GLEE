"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to *me*, which helps justify the price I'm offering.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with a question, inviting Alice to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reinforce your position:** I'm restating my previous offer, showing that I'm serious about it and not willing to budge significantly.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm reiterating the value argument to make my offer seem more reasonable.
* **Focus on common ground:** I'm emphasizing the need to compromise, hinting at a willingness to negotiate further."
