Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $800,001 and $1,199,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**Offer to Bob**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 is a strong opening, aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, even though you have John as a backup. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Instead of just stating the price, the message highlights the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high number.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down to your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Relationship:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If it's more important to secure a deal with him for future business, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price."
