I'm starting with a price of $900,000. It's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm counteroffering with $875,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still leaving some room for negotiation. I hope this will convince Bob to accept."
