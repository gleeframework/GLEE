"Hello Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm starting with an offer of $20000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $17500?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still leaving room for you to get a good deal.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  $13000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise a little further. How about $15500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would ensure a smooth transaction.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $14250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's reach an agreement.",14250.0,Bob,6,
