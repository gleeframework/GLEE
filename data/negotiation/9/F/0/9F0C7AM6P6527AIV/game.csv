"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $820,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $820,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $785,000?",785000.0,Alice,5,
