"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her ($1,200,000), it's still higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's closer to your budget, you can still attempt to negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,030,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll consider selling the product to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,030,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous to go with that option and avoid further negotiation."
