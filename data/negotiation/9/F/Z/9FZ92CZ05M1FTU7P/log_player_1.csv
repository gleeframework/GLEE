"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $180 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob away right away. This gives us room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to entice him with the value of the product and leave some room for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $180 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'd only be able to pay $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not going to sell it for that low of a price. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to work with you. I'd be happy to accept $140.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm still aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm also trying to be flexible and find a middle ground with Bob. I've dropped the price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not giving up on getting a better price yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? That would be a good deal for both of us, and I think it's fair given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more to show I'm serious about finding an agreement, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired range.  I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob to accept."
