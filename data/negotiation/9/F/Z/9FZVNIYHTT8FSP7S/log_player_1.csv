Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll have room to negotiate down in subsequent rounds."

```

This is a tough decision, as $16,000 is still a decent amount of money. However,  I've reached my limit for negotiating with Bob.  The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, so I'm better off selling it to John and ensuring I get my minimum value."
