"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  This price reflects the product's quality and the benefits you'll experience."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John right now would be a safe choice, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is the lowest I can go.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I understand the product's value, I'm aiming for a price closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I believe I can squeeze out a bit more during the negotiation.  John is a safety net, but I'm determined to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers and settle on $8,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still not willing to drop below $9,000, and I believe Bob is willing to go a little higher.  John is always an option, but I'm committed to squeezing out the best possible price from Bob.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $8,875?
