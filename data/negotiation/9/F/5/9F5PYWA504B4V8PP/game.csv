"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  This price reflects the product's quality and the benefits you'll experience.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is the lowest I can go.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's work towards a deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I understand the product's value, I'm aiming for a price closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers and settle on $8,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $8,875?  This is a small compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal.",8875.0,Alice,7,
