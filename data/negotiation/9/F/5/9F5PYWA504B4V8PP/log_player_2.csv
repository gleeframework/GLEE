Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is the lowest I can go.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's work towards a deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $8,875?  This is a small compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly committed to getting a price above $8,500 and is willing to make small concessions.  At $8,875, you're getting a $1,125 discount from John's price and further haggling has a high chance of failing. This is a good deal and it makes sense to accept."
