It's time to cut bait.  Alice is clearly comfortable in the $910,000+ range, and we're unlikely to get her below our $900,000 threshold with only one round left. John offers a sure thing at $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the product at that price than to risk getting stuck with nothing and having to restart with a new seller."
