Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to part with it for $120.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you have leverage. Starting higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Creating a sense of value:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting your belief in the product's worth aim to make Bob perceive the value as exceeding $100.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While aiming for $120, the message leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price agreeable to both parties.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
