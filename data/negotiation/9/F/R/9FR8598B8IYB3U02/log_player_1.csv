{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that is above Bob's perceived value but still allows for some negotiation space.  I'm also keeping in mind the potential sale to John at $15,000, giving me a good baseline to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop the price that low. I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired value, but still leaves room for a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  How about $11,000? This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,500? This is the best I can do, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll aim for a price closer to $12,000 in my next counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still not quite there for me. I'm prepared to go down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
