{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John,  it's always advantageous to try for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **Bob's Perspective:**  He gains a product worth $1,000,000 to him for $100,000 less.
    * **Alice's Perspective:** She earns an extra $100,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob's feedback to encourage negotiation."
