"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,750 is closer to my budget, I still can't go above $8,500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm getting close to accepting John's offer, but I'm willing to give you one more chance.  $8,500 is still a bit low, but I'll come down to $8,600. This is my final offer.",8600.0,Alice,5,
