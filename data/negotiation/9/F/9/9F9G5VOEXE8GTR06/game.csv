"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I value it at, and still allows you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm aiming to stay under $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's meet in the middle, how about we close this deal at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and agree on $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
