"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's the best I can do at the moment.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're set on $8,500.  While I can appreciate that, I do have other potential buyers. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000, but that's my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to go to $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.  If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
