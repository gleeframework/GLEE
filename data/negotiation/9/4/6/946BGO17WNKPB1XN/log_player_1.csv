"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a strategic move to see if he's willing to pay more than his perceived value. If he rejects, it gives me room to negotiate downwards in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still staying above what I know Bob is willing to pay. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to $100, especially since I have a backup option with John. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm dropping the price again, but only slightly. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, while still holding out for a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now lower than what John is willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
