"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe the value it offers justifies the price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a positive opportunity for Bob, emphasizing the value the product holds. This helps to build rapport and encourages a response. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground that allows me to maximize my profit while still keeping Bob interested. I'm hoping this initial offer will encourage him to make a counteroffer, allowing us to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $1,250,000. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal quickly, I'm confident in the value of my product and believe I can secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, aiming for a deal somewhere between $1,500,000 and $1,250,000. I need to keep in mind that if I reject too many offers, I risk losing Bob and being forced to sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000,  which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while also emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to compromise. I'm trying to find a price point that Bob might find acceptable while still remaining profitable for me.

**Strategy:**

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price for me.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I will make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down further to $1,450,000.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

* **Message:** I am emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the fairness of my offer. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that this might be the last chance to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, $1,425,000 is still just a bit short of what I need.

We're close to a deal, let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1437500}
```

* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of my offer and highlighting that we are close to reaching an agreement. I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed it carefully and would like to counter with an offer of $1,430,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product and I hope we can agree on this amount.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. While Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, it's very close.  Considering the limited time and the risk of losing Bob, I'm choosing to accept this offer to secure a sale.

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm weighing the risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price versus the potential reward of securing a slightly higher price in the next round.  
* **Time Constraint:** With only two rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited. I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision.

Even though I'm accepting a price lower than my desired minimum, it's still a significant profit, and it allows me to close the deal and move on to other opportunities."
