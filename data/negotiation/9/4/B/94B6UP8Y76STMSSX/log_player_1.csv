{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not too far off. This gives him some room to negotiate, but also sets the bar high to ensure I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues it. I'll counteroffer him and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $65 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe the product's worth justifies a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your budget concerns. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
