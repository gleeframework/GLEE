"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price you're asking is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is appealing, I must confess $700,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be realistic with my budget. $1,900,000 is still too far out of my range. If you're willing to come down closer to $800,000, I'm still very interested.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your budget constraints, but I need to be upfront â€“  $800,000 is far below the product's worth. It represents a significant investment on my part, and I can't justify going that low. I'm willing to consider $1,650,000. This is my final offer; I hope you understand.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
