"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to sell for less.  Since you have a fallback option with John, there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount of 25% from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also that I believe the product is worth less than her asking price. It's a strong opening move that will give me a good understanding of how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but $900,000 is still a significant amount. I want to see if I can get her even lower, especially since I have John as a backup. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  $800,000 is still a good deal for me, and it's a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Alice's most recent offer. This helps me gauge how far she's willing to go and how close we are to a deal."
