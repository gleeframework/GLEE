Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested, as the product is worth $800,000 to him. If he rejects, I'll see what kind of counteroffer he makes and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, so I'm rejecting it.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my original offer, but still leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $780,000 is still above my minimum of $800,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, I'm accepting his offer.  Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower price or a delay, and ultimately, I want to sell the product."
