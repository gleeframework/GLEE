"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the value I've invested in it, and $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14000 for it. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $13000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,6,

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $13000 for the product. However, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price to sweeten the deal. I'll meet you at $12500.

"I'm disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement at $12500, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to sell the product to you. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I hope you can meet me at this point. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,9,
