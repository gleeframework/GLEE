"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. However, it establishes a starting point and demonstrates my confidence in the product's value. I want to see if Bob is willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still holding out for a significant profit. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still staying firm on a price that's reasonable for me while also showing flexibility in the negotiation.  I believe this offer might be more appealing to Bob, and it's still well above his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below what I consider a fair price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price. I'll keep that in mind as I continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm making a final attempt to meet Bob halfway. This offer is still well above his last offer, but it also shows him I'm willing to compromise. If he rejects this offer, I'm going to sell to John."
