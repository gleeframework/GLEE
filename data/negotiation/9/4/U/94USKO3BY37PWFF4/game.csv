"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $7,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7000.0,Alice,3,
