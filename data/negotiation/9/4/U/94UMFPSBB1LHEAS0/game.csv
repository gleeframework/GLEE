"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,200,000 for the product. I think it's a bit steep at $1,700,000. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap this time.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,350,000.  Would you consider $1,325,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. ",1325000.0,Alice,7,
