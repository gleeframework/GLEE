"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price gives us room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a high offer and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  I'm also keeping the option of selling to John for my minimum price in mind. If Bob isn't willing to negotiate, I can always go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,200,000 for the product. I think it's a bit steep at $1,700,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a compromise that benefits us both."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping to persuade him that this price is still fair.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the need for a ""middle ground,"" suggesting a willingness to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my minimum price while still being appealing to Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely have to make a difficult decision between accepting a lower price or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. Can we meet in the middle again?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still below my comfort zone. I'm not eager to close the deal at this price, but I'm also not ready to abandon the negotiation entirely. I believe there's still room for a higher counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counteroffer, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount.  However, I'm also starting to consider selling to John if Bob remains insistent on a lower price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap this time."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

* **Urgency:** I'm hinting at urgency by stating ""Let's see if we can bridge the gap this time,"" suggesting that I may be willing to walk away if we don't find common ground.

**Strategy:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm not ready to settle for $1,300,000 yet. 

**Strategy:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,350,000.  Would you consider $1,325,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. Can we find a way to make it work?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the final few rounds, and Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm tempted to try one more counteroffer, I'm also wary of the risk of losing out entirely.  

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time remaining and the likelihood of further negotiation, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  It's a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and it's the safest option to ensure I don't walk away with less than I'm comfortable with."
