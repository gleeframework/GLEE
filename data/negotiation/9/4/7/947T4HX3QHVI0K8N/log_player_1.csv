Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I've carefully considered its worth to both of us, and I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from owning it."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have a significant advantage knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message implies you've considered Bob's potential gain, making the offer seem more reasonable and appealing.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
