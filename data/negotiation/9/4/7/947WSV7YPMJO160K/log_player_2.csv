"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  You should reject the offer and start a counter-negotiation. There's a lot of room for bargaining before you have to resort to buying from John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is still above my limit. I'll reject her offer and try to get a lower price with another counteroffer. There's still some negotiating room, and I don't want to buy from John yet unless I absolutely have to."
