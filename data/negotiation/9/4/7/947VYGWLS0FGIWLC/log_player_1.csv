{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for compromise. It also provides a positive and encouraging tone to the message, aiming to encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know if that's a possibility for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a far cry from my ideal price, it's still worth continuing the negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I can potentially achieve a better outcome by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
