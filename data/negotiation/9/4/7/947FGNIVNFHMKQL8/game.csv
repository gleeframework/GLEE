"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to the right buyer is significantly higher than the market average.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,030,000.",1030000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, this product offers significant long-term value that I'm confident justifies a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to accept $980,000 - it's my final offer.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone above my budget, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll make one more offer: $920,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",920000.0,Bob,6,
