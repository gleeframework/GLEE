"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This is a bold opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  It also signals that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for less than what it's worth to me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. This is a good compromise, demonstrating flexibility while staying above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for me. It exceeds my minimum value of $1,000,000 and is a good profit. I'm going to accept it and close the deal."
