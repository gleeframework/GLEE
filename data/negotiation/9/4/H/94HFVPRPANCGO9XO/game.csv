"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000?  That's still a fair price for a product worth $10,000 to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $9,500. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll consider buying it from John.",9500.0,Bob,4,
