"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm happy to discuss further, but I'd like to start with an offer of $1,050,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and I believe my initial offer reflects that fairly. To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This feels like a strong compromise. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $1,080,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to engage in this negotiation. I've considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for a product of this caliber.  Does this work for you?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my ideal range. I'm ready to close the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,090,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
