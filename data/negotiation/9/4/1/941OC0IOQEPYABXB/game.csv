"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to commit to the full $1100000. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'll counter with a price of $1025000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, and $975000 is not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, which was $1025000. I'll counter with a price of $1012500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I've made a significant concession, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $990000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1007500. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1007500.0,Alice,7,
