"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has potential value, I'm not comfortable with that price point. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still offering you substantial value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
