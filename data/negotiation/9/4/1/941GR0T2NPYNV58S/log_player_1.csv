Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has potential value, I'm not comfortable with that price point. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still offering you substantial value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below my minimum. John's offer of $800,000 guarantees I meet my bottom line.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale."
