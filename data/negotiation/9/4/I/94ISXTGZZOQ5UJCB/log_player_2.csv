"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $15,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's valuation.  Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  It's also worth noting that Alice's initial offer is a little aggressive and doesn't leave much room for Bob to counter with a lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $12,000.  However, I'm looking to get a better price for the product.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This is still a good deal for you as you value the product at $8,000, and it's significantly lower than the $15,000 I would pay elsewhere. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than the initial offer, Bob can still negotiate a lower price. Alice's offer is still above her valuation, and there's room for further compromise. It's also worth noting that Bob has a significant amount of bargaining power due to the fact that he can buy from John for a higher price if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a little too high for me. Considering your valuation and my willingness to pay up to $15,000, I think $11,000 is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $12,200. This is a fair price, taking into account your willingness to pay up to $15,000. I believe this is a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still a little high.  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  The $15,000 option with John provides a safety net, making Bob more willing to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $12,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $11,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $12,000. I'll offer you the product for $12,100. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to get closer to Bob's ideal price, but there's still some room for negotiation.  Bob is within striking distance of a good deal, and there's no need to rush into accepting Alice's offer.  It's better to continue negotiating to see if Alice is willing to go lower.  The option to buy from John for $15,000 provides Bob with a safety net and strengthens his negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $12,100 is still above my target. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's closer to your minimum value and a much better price than I'd get elsewhere. Let's close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $12,000. I'll offer you the product for $12,300. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is very close to her minimum value, and Bob is very close to his maximum value. It's likely that further negotiation will result in very small concessions from both sides. There is only one round left, and there is a high risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer, leading to a deal with John. Since John's price is still lower than Bob's maximum, it makes sense to buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
