"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing your budget constraints.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
