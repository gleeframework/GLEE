{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's max:** You're leaving room for negotiation and giving Bob a sense of a good deal. 
* **It's assertive:** You're confident in the product's value and are not afraid to ask for a good price.

Keep in mind that you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can potentially get closer to the $1,400,000 price I initially offered.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing your budget constraints.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
