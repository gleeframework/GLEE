"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my target price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which would still be a very good deal for both of us. I believe this price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price is $850,000, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my part and is a fair offer considering the value I place on the product.  I believe this price is a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go a bit lower. I'm offering the product to you for $925,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you place on it.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $925,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects a significant compromise on both sides, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and then I'll have to reconsider selling to John. I'm offering the product to you for $915,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",915000.0,Alice,7,
