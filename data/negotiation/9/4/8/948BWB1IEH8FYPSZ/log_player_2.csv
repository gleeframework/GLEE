"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something worth significantly more. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially do better. You have a higher budget than Alice's valuation, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1300000. This is a great deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer keeps the bargaining process going, potentially leading to a lower price for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,300,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1275000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will counter with a higher price or reject your offer altogether.  Accepting the offer guarantees you get the product at a reasonable price."
