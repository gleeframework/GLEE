"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something worth significantly more. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  This would give us both a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1300000. This is a great deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction quickly.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1300000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1250000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1275000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
