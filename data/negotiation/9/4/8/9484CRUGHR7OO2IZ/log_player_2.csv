# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can save more money by rejecting it. You know John will sell it for $12,000, and you're aiming to spend no more than that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, getting you closer to your goal of maximum savings."
