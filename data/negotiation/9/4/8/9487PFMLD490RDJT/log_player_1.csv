"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm aiming to get the best price possible while leaving room for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I still have 8 rounds left, and there's a chance I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it's still a respectable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to settle for too little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is equal to John's offer, and I have a good chance of getting a better price if I keep negotiating. However, there are only 6 rounds remaining, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether. I'll take the $8,000 and move on."
