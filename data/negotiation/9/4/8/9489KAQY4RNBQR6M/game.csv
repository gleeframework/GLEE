"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $7,000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $12,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you a bit closer to the middle, how about $8,500?  I'm really keen on this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
