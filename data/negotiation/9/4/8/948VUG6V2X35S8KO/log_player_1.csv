Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,350,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's also likely that further negotiation with Bob will only result in smaller increments, and the risk of him walking away entirely is increasing. I'm going to accept his offer to secure the sale."
