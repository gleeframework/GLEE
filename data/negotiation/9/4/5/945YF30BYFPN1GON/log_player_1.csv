"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't proceed with a purchase at $15,000. Could we discuss a price closer to my budget, perhaps around $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  I need to negotiate further.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is just too low for me to consider. I could be flexible, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $13,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $13,000 is quite high for my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $11,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a decent offer, and significantly better than John's.  I'll accept it.
