"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can see that you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,100,000, so I'll offer it to you for $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?  It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $1,062,500?  ",1062500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, as I mentioned earlier, but I can see that you're close to your target. I'll make a slight concession and offer it to you for $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to hear back from you.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
