"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own needs. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still give you a significant advantage over the value you've placed on the product, and it allows me to get closer to the price I need.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, which would be $1,025,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
