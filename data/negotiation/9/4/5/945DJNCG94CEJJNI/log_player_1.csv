Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?

How about $1,050,000?  This would still give you a significant advantage over the value you've placed on the product, and it allows me to get closer to the price I need.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
