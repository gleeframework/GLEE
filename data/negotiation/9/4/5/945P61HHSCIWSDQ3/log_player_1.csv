Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a deal that's fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
