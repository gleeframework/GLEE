"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a deal that's fair.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
