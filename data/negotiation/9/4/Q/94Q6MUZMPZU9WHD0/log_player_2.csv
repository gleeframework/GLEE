Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my budget.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I need to lower the price significantly.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my valuation and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and reflects the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal fairly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still outside my budget. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to see a lower price to consider accepting. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally close this deal.  But I'm running out of time, and if we can't reach an agreement soon, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price, but $950,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go a little higher, but I want to see if we can bridge the gap with a final counteroffer in the next round.  If we can't find common ground, I'm prepared to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a good compromise for both of us. I believe this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 925000}
