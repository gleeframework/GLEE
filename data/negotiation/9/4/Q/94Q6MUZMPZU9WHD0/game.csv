"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my valuation and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and reflects the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal fairly.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally close this deal.  But I'm running out of time, and if we can't reach an agreement soon, I'll need to consider other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a good compromise for both of us. I believe this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",925000.0,Bob,6,
