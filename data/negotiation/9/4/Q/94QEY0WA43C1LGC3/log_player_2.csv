"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $9,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8500. I'm willing to consider $9250, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is now offering $9,250, which is closer to your ideal price but still higher than what you want to pay.
* Since there's still some room to negotiate, rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price you're more comfortable with."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we split the difference and settle on $8875? This would be a fair deal for both of us and get this transaction moving."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $8875. How about we meet at $9000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the sale moving.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $9,000. This is the same as her initial offer, but it is still within your budget of $10,000. 
* While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely. 
* Accepting this offer is the safest option as it saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
