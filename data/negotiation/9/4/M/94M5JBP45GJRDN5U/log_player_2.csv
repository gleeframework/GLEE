"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It makes more sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds left to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget of $10,000. This is a strong opening move that clearly signals my willingness to buy but establishes my price limit. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I have 7 rounds left, and I believe I can continue to negotiate a lower price. It's important to be patient and not give in too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show flexibility and willingness to compromise. $12,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price given my budget.  I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us, and this offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I have 5 rounds remaining and believe I can negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already made some concessions. I'm not going to rush into a deal when I can continue to push for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again to $13,000, which is a compromise between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a better price. With only 4 rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure to reach a deal."
