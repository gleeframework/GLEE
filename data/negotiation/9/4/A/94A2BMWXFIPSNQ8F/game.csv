"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $950,000. This price reflects both our needs, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
