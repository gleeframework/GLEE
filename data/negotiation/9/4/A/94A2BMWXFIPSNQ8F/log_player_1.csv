"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value ($800,000), but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial deal. It also encourages Bob to respond and participate in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below the value you've set for the product. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $950,000. This price reflects both our needs, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than your initial offer. This shows flexibility while ensuring you're not giving away too much value."
