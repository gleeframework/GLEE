"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better deal.  I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $950,000. This price reflects both our needs, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's below my maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly closer to my target price.  I'm happy to accept this offer and move forward with the purchase."
