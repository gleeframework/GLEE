"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a budget of around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it's worth a considerable investment. How about meeting halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. Would that be acceptable?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you moving closer to the asking price.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value this opportunity with you and I'm willing to come down slightly to $14,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand you have other offers, but $14,000 is still pushing my budget. How about we settle at $12,500? This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",12500.0,Bob,6,
