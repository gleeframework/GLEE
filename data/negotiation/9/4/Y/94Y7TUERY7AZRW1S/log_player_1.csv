{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.  It's important to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for $9,500. The product is worth significantly more to him, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my target price. I'm not sure I can push him much higher, and it's still well above my minimum of $8,000.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
