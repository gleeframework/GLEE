,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to offer you $900,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $950,000 is still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle again - I'm offering $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids us both having to go through more rounds of negotiations. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
