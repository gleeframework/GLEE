"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can meet you in the middle at $11500. It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to go up to $11000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you at $11000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet at $11250. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, as I mentioned before. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we meet at that price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
