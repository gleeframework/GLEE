Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while also leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum goal of $800,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I want to explore those options before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $900,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for a price that low yet. I still believe I can get closer to my target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's acceptable to me. I'm hoping this will push us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000. Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and we're running out of time. It's clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum price, and I'm not willing to drop below my minimum.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price point, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
