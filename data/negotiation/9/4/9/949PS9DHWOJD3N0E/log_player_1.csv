Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic but Realistic:** This price allows me to potentially get a good deal while still considering Bob's perspective.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, which encourages Bob to counter-offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to:

* **Accept a counteroffer:** If Bob offers a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, I'll consider it.
* **Make a counter-offer:** If Bob's counter-offer is too low, I'll make a counter-offer to get closer to my desired price.
* **Walk away:** If the negotiation drags on or Bob doesn't come close to my minimum, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's $11,000 but still lower than my minimum of $15,000, aiming for a price that is more favorable to me. I'll also be prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $11,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** My message maintains a positive tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept Counteroffer:** If Bob accepts my offer, I'll sell the product for $11,500.
* **Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John.
* **Walking Away:** If the negotiation becomes unproductive or Bob's offers consistently fall short of my minimum, I'll sell to John."
