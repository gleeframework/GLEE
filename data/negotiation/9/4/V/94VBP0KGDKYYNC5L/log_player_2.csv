Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
