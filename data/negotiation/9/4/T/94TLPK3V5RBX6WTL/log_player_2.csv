"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above your maximum acceptable price. It's a starting point for negotiation. You're hoping that Alice will be willing to meet you halfway, but you're also prepared to walk away if she doesn't come down enough."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. While it's closer to your maximum budget, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing your offer slightly from the previous round while still remaining below your maximum budget. It shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate but also signals that you're firm on your price range.  You're hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to accept the offer, but you're also prepared to walk away and buy from John if she rejects it again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to your maximum budget, it's getting into a range where you're not saving much compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance that continued negotiation with Alice would drag on and you might not be able to get a significantly better price.  It's more efficient to buy from John and secure the product at your maximum acceptable price."
