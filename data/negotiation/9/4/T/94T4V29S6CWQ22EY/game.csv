,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is still a little low for me.  How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it's a great value.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my absolute limit.  Let's close this deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
