Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This price is still a good profit for you considering my maximum budget and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum requirement without significant further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which, at this point, outweighs the potential for a higher profit with Bob but with the risk of it going even lower.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
