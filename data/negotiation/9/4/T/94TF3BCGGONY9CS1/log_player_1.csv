Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Compromise:** If Bob rejects, there's still room to negotiate down to a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Keeping John in mind as a potential buyer keeps the pressure on Bob to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that's a bit steep for my budget.  Could you do $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Counter-Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested. This gives me an opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $150 is my safety net. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $125 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  While I'm coming down, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
