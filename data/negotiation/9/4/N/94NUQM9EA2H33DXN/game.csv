"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,500?  I'm confident you'll still get a good value at that price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far off from that price. Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,500 is still too low.  Let's try $8,250. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a good deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $7,750? That's halfway between our last two offers and seems like a reasonable compromise.",7750.0,Bob,6,
