"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, the price of $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desired selling price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This way, we can both feel comfortable with the price and move forward with the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
