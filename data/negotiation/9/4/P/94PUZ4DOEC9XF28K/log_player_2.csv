"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it presents significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This considers the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above the product's worth to Bob, but it's significantly lower than John's offer of $10,000.  At this point, it's a reasonable compromise to secure the product and avoid further negotiation."
