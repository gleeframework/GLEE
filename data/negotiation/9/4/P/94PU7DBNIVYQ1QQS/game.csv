"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see it at a lower price.  How about $14,000? ",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a good home for the product, $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you do $17,000? I'm confident it's a fair price given its value.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $17,000 is still a little out of my range. Let's meet in the middle at $15,500. This would be a good deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
