Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. While his offer is increasing, we are still in a strong position to negotiate, especially with John as a guaranteed backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now made the same offer twice, indicating he may not be willing to move much higher. We are still significantly below our minimum, and we risk losing a guaranteed sale to John at our desired price.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the sure deal."
