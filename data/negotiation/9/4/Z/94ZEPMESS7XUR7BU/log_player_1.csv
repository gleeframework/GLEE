{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation, recognizing that Bob values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is above your minimum, you can likely do better. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but I'm on a tight budget. How about $75? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering $75, which is close to your minimum of $80. However, John is a guaranteed buyer at $80. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, especially since he's already shown a tendency to push for lower prices."
