Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000.

Alice has come down a bit again, and we're now very close to my target price. It's likely she won't go lower, and I'm comfortable with this deal. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without risking losing it to another seller or facing further negotiations."
