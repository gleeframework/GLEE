Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I do see its value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This reflects the value to me and allows for some profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.
