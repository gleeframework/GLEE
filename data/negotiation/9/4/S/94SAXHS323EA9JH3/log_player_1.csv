"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is based on the assumption that Bob is likely to have a higher value for the product than my minimum of $8,000. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but also want to leave room for negotiation.  I'll be ready to counter-offer if Bob rejects this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it'll be appealing enough for Bob to consider.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal. This ensures a good profit while avoiding the risk of losing the deal entirely."
