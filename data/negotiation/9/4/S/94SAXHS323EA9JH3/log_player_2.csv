"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm offering $7,000 for the product. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget and leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, I'm still willing to try to negotiate further. $9,000 is still more than I want to spend.  I'll try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500 for the product. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties."
