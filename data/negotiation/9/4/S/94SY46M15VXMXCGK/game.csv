"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that starting price is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd need to see something closer to $10,000 to make this make sense.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer for now.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To be completely honest, I'm ready to buy this today, but only if we can agree on $12,000.  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $13,000 and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make a new offer, but it will be a compromise. I'll meet you at $13,000, but I want a commitment from you to buy the product within the next 24 hours. If you're not ready to make a deal today, I'll have to explore other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
