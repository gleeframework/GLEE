Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a very fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business, and it will allow us both to walk away from this deal satisfied. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.
