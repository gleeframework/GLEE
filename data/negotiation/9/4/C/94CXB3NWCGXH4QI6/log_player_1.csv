"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone sets a positive atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning that the product is ""amazing"" and that I think Bob would ""love"" it subtly emphasizes its worth.

This strategy aims to:

* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is willing to pay a higher price. 
* **Establish a starting point:** Gives Bob a clear understanding of my expectations. 
* **Encourage counteroffers:**  Bob is likely to counteroffer, allowing me to see his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a similar product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider reducing the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Testing Bob's interest:** By rejecting his offer, I can assess his level of interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to my value.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to close the gap while staying above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? I'm confident you won't find a better deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Reiterating value:**  I remind Bob of the product's quality and value to reinforce my asking price. 
* **Closing the deal:** This offer presents a clear opportunity for Bob to get a good deal while still allowing me to meet my minimum.

This approach aims to:

* **Find a mutually agreeable price:**  It's a fair compromise that might be acceptable to Bob. 
* **Increase pressure:** By stating that he won't find a better deal, I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
