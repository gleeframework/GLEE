"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I could do $900,000.  That's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
