"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,400,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, but I can't go any higher than that.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
