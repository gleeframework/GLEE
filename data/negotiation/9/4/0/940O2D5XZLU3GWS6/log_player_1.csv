Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my needs. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is a strong outcome. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of negotiations breaking down.  It's always possible to leave some money on the table in a negotiation, and this offer seems reasonable."
