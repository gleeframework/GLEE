Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than your ideal price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120. Offering it at $100 gives him a significant discount while still earning you a profit well above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit from Bob, we have a safety net with John. If Bob rejects the offer, we can still sell it for $80."
