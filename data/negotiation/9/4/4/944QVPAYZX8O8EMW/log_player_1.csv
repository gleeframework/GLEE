Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategic aspects:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to aim high with Bob.  A starting price of $1,200,000 leaves significant room for negotiation while still potentially securing a substantial profit.
* **Justification of value:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly emphasizes that the product is worth the higher price, encouraging Bob to consider its benefits beyond just the base worth of $800,000.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is polite and invites discussion (""Let me know your thoughts""). This signals that you're willing to negotiate, which might be necessary to secure a deal with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, you might adjust the starting price slightly lower.
* **Market dynamics:**  If similar products are selling for significantly more than $800,000 in the current market, you could justify an even higher initial offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
