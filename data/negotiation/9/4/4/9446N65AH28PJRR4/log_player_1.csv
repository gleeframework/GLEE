"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. My initial offer is $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is a significant amount above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob to make him more motivated to negotiate.
* **Open-ended question:** I ask for Bob's opinion to encourage him to engage and potentially counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong while leaving room for compromise and ensuring Bob is actively involved."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a little more.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $100 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer to show I'm listening and engaging in the negotiation.
* **Counter-argument:** I explain why $100 is too low for me, highlighting that $110 is still a good deal for him.
* **Compromise:** I offer a compromise with a price in the middle of our two previous offers. 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" aspect to make the offer more attractive.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum of $80 and represents a decent profit.  Considering that I have already rejected his previous offer, it's likely he won't budge further.  Accepting his offer is a good compromise and ensures a sale."
