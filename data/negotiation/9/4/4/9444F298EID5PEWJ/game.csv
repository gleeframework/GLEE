"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am not able to meet the price of $1,600,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,550,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that the product's value could be reflected at a lower price. Would you consider $1,450,000 as a reasonable offer?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  However,  $1,450,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $1,525,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered your proposal, and I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000. This is the highest I can go, given my budget constraints. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to understand the value this product represents. My absolute floor is $1,500,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, as I have another interested buyer. I believe this is more than fair considering its potential.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
