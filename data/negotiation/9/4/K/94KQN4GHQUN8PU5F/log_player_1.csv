"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with my minimum price.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, I'm not willing to go lower.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to lose $3,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm willing to lower my price a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal.  $11,000 is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm starting to run out of rounds, but I'm not willing to lose $2,500. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this is my final offer.  $10,500 is a fair price for both of us.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'm going to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price, but we're running out of time.  I'd rather sell to John and get the $12,000."
