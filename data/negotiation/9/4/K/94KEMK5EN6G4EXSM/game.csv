"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I've done some research and I believe it's a bit overpriced at $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't accept $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but I really need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $775000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
