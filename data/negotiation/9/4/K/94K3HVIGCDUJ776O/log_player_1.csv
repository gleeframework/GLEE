"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I want to try to get a better price. I'll counteroffer him and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $15000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and $13,500 is not quite there yet. I'll counteroffer one more time and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $14,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for you. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $13875?  That's a fair compromise for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,875 is close to my desired price, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's better to secure this deal now than risk losing him and having to settle with John for a lower price."
