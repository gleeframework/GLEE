Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially gain an extra $400,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity while still being significantly beneficial for Bob (saving him $400,000 compared to our fallback option).
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning other interested parties encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the offer."
