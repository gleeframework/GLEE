Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale and still offer you a fair price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a price under $8,000, but I'm not comfortable going below $9,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe it would be a great asset for you.  Is there any wiggle room for you to go a little higher?  Perhaps we can find a solution that works for both of us.

It seems Alice is unwilling to budge below $9,000.  At this point, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and secure the product from John for $8,000."
