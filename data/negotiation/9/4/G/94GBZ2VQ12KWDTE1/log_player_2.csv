Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth every penny of $80. Would you like to make this investment in enhancing your experience?

You've already stated that the product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $80.  There's no benefit to buying from Alice.  You're better off waiting and buying from John, as that's your stated fallback option."
