"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be closer to $900,000 for this deal to work.  This price still leaves room for both of us to gain value, and it's a far better deal than you'll find elsewhere. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
