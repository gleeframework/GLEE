"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be closer to $900,000 for this deal to work.  This price still leaves room for both of us to gain value, and it's a far better deal than you'll find elsewhere. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
