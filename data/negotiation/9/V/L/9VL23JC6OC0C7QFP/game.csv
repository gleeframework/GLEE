"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's a high-quality item worth a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $10000. This price is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $8500? This price still represents a fantastic deal for you, given the value of the product.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a sense that we're not too far apart.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $7800. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $7800 is a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $7500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,6,
