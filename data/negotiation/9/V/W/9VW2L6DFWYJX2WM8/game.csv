"Bob, I understand you're looking for a more affordable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1050000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, but $850000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $980000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.
