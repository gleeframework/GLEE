"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Considering its worth, I propose an initial offer of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $850,000 is below its true worth.  Would you consider $900,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $900,000 is a better price than John's, it's still higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to try and lower the price even further."
