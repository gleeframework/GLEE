"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $850,000 is below its true worth.  Would you consider $900,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. Let's try to close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
