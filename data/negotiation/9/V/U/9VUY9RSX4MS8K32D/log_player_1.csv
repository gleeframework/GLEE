Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $600,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the current market and my specific needs for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised price strikes a more balanced compromise while reflecting the significant value this product offers.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. This product would need to fit within a tighter budget for it to make sense for me. I could consider a price closer to $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
