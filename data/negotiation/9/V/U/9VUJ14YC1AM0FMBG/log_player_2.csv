"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000, would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I really think this product will bring you a lot of value in the long run. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price and $13,500 is still above his ideal price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's still a potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  I'm confident we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $13,750? I think it's a great value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, Bob needs to consider the potential of not reaching a deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Value Trade-off:**  $13,750 is still a good price for Bob, especially considering the potential of not finding a better deal with Alice. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice becoming unwilling to sell or to a situation where Bob runs out of rounds and is forced to buy from John.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer at $13,750 is the most prudent decision for Bob at this stage of the negotiation."
