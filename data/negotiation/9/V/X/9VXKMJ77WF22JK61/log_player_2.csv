"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is $100,000 lower than the value of the product to Bob ($1,200,000). Accepting the offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for Bob, even if there's potential to negotiate further."
