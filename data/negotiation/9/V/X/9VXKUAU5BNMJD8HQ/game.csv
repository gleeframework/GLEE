"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is much lower.  How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $12,000 is still quite a way from where I need to be.  I'd be willing to accept $14,500.  This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $14,500 is still out of my budget. I can go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
