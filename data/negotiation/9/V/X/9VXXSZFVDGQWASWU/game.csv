"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price. How about we try $85? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm trying to find a compromise.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  To be honest, $80 is about as high as I'm willing to go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to buy.",80.0,Bob,6,
