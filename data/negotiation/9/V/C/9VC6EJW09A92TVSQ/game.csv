"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we meet at $150? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,6,
