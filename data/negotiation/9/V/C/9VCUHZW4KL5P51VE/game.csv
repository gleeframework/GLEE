"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $9,500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet at $9,200? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
