"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $8,500. I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, as I can easily get the product from John for $8,000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is bluffing. He claims he can get the product from John for $8,000, but we know John is buying it for $10,000. 
* Bob's final offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than John's offer.
* It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk a lower offer from Bob in the next round."
