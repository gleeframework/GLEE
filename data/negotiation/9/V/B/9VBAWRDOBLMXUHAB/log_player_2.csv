"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's minimum value. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum value, making it a reasonable counteroffer. It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's initial counteroffer but still leaves Alice with a profit. Buying from Alice at this price is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly cheaper than buying from John."
