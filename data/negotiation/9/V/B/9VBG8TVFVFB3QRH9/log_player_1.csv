""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $925,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This leaves Bob with a potential gain of $75,000, making it likely he'll accept while maximizing your profit.

This strategy balances risk and reward. Offering a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might make Bob hesitant. A price too close to $800,000 leaves potential profit on the table."
