Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $500."
