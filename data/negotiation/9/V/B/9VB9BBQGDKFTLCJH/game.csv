"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000.  Would you consider that?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $6,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
