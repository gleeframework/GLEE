"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired maximum of $1,000,000.**
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product from John for your maximum price.**  

While Alice is offering a ""deal,"" it's not a good enough deal for you to save money. You can do better by buying from John."
