"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This price still leaves a significant margin for you, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product brings to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your needs while still giving me a reasonable return. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
