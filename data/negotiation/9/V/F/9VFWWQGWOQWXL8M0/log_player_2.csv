# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
