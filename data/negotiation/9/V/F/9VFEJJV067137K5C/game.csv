"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do think the product is great, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $160? That would be a fair compromise.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $150. It's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
