Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I would like to counteroffer at $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price, I know John will buy it for $120 without further negotiation. It's better to take the guaranteed sale and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer further in subsequent rounds."
