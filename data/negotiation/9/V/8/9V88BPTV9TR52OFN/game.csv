"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. Given the product's value and my investment, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would give you a substantial saving and still allow me a fair profit. Let's meet halfway.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
