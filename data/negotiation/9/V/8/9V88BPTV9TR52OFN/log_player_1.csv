Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're making sure you're earning at least $800,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate but leaves room for you to make a profit.
* **It opens the door for negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond and participate in the process. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You can adjust your price and messaging based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob ($1,200,000). There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. Given the product's value and my investment, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would give you a substantial saving and still allow me a fair profit. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant amount closer to your desired price and still leaves Bob with a substantial profit margin considering the product's value to him.  It's also important to remember that you can always choose to sell to John later if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
