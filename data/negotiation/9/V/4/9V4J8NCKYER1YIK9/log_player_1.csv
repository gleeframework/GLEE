Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  My initial offer is $1,750,000. This reflects the value I place on it, while also acknowledging your potential interest. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I have 10 rounds, and I believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation. Selling to John right now would be a safe bet, but I'm aiming for the best possible outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, considering your interest in the product.  This reflects the value I place on it while acknowledging your potential interest.  Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I have 6 rounds left, and I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. Selling to John right now would be a safe bet, but I'm aiming for the best possible outcome.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. Given your interest in the product, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm confident this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering $1,450,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better offer are slim, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 

It's time to secure the deal with John and avoid potentially prolonging the negotiation with Bob."
