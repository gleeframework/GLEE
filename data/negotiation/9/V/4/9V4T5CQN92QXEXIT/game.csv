"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $900,000. This would still be a good profit for you and a significant saving for me. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to invest less, but I have to consider my own bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This would be a significant savings for me, while still allowing you a good profit. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
