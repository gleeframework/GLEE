"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his $10,000 limit, he can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $11,500, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  This offer is still within Bob's budget and might be attractive to Alice, especially since she has room to make a profit even at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still within his budget and has several rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price. There's a chance Alice will lower her price further, especially if she wants to close the deal before Bob decides to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer slightly to $10,750. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.  This offer is a good middle ground, demonstrating that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price. It's likely Alice will consider this offer as she's already reduced her price twice, and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price, but there are still 5 rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal.  Alice has shown a willingness to come down, and Bob might be able to secure a price closer to $10,500 or even lower in the remaining rounds.  Buying from John at this point would mean missing out on potentially saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to be persistent in his negotiation. He's now willing to offer $10,600. This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his target. Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price, and Bob believes he can secure a deal within his budget with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is now offering a price that is only $800 above Bob's desired price, Bob is still pushing for a better deal. There are only 3 rounds left, and Bob believes that he can still push Alice to come down further. This is especially true if Alice wants to close the deal before Bob chooses to buy from John. Additionally, if Bob were to accept, he would miss out on the potential to get a better deal in the next round, risking ending up with a price that is closer to $10,900 than his desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10550}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a final push for a deal that's just slightly above Bob's target price of $10,000. With only two rounds left, it's a calculated risk, but Bob believes that Alice may be willing to accept a price that's closer to his desired amount to avoid the possibility of losing the deal altogether. It also demonstrates a continued commitment to negotiation, showing Alice that Bob is serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, Bob is now facing a difficult decision. While $10,700 is closer to his target price, he has already made a counteroffer that Alice rejected in the previous round. It's unlikely she will accept a lower offer in the final round, especially since she has consistently lowered her price throughout the negotiation.  Therefore, it's more strategically advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees he gets the product within his budget, and he saves $700 compared to Alice's final offer."
