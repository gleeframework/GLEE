"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
