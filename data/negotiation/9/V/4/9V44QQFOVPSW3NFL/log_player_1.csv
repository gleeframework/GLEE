"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,400,000. It's worth a lot to you, and I believe this price is fair considering its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than you think. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I have 8 rounds left and can still potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I have 6 rounds left and can still potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,275,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1275000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has not moved from his previous offer of $1,250,000. While this is above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth, and I only have 4 rounds remaining. With John offering $1,000,000, it's safer to secure this sale than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
