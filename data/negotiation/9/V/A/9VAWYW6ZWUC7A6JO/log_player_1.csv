``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for some bargaining.  I'm confident Bob will find it attractive, but it also gives me room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $1050000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,100,000?  This price reflects the product's value to both of us, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1075000.  This price is fair to both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering I could sell to John for $1,000,000. I'm going to accept his offer."
