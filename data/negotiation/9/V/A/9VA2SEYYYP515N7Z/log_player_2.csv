"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that this product holds a significant importance to me, reflecting my investment of over $1,200,000 in its development and refinement. Considering its immense worth to you, I am extending a special offer to purchase it for $950,000. This price encapsulates not only the cost of production but also the strategic value it could bring to your endeavors. I believe this is a mutually beneficial proposition, allowing us to reach a fair agreement while respecting the product's true market value. Should you require any further information or have questions about the product, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's story is irrelevant.**  Her investment or the product's supposed ""strategic value"" shouldn't influence your decision. Focus on your maximum price and the alternatives.
* **You have a better alternative.** John offers the product for $1,200,000. While Alice's offer of $950,000 is tempting, you can still try to negotiate a better price with her before resorting to John. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. There's room for negotiation before you have to accept John's offer."
