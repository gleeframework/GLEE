"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This allows for room to negotiate and hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept rather than immediately making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's still above my minimum.  I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $10,500. This is still a good price for me, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this encourages Bob to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already on round 4.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn.  It's better to take the $9,500 than to risk getting a lower price or selling to John for $8,000."
