"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $950,000. This allows you to gain significant value while ensuring I get a good return on my investment.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
