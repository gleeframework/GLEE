"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'll start with an offer of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counteroffer at $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $13500? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not ready to meet you at $13500 just yet. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to stay closer to my minimum price. Let's try $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still too high for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $14500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14500, Bob, but I'm still not sure that's enough for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll try to meet you in the middle. Let's say... $15750. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my minimum price. What do you think?",15750.0,Alice,7,
