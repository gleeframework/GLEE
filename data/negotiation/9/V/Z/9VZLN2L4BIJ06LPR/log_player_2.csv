Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do think it's a great product, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,500?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $5,500 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This would still give you a great deal on the product and allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal."
