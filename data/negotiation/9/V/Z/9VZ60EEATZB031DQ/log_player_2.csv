Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $950,000. This reflects a significant discount for you, while still allowing me to make a fair profit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $875,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $912,500?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle.  $895,000 is still a bit below my desired price point, but I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle at $903,750. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $903,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $903,750

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is consistently meeting in the middle and the price difference is getting smaller.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price and there's a risk Alice will stop negotiating altogether. Accepting the $903,750 offer secures a significant discount while avoiding the risk of paying the full $1,000,000 to John."
