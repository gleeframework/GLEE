Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for compromise. It also expresses a willingness to negotiate and emphasizes fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
