"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to make a profit.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
