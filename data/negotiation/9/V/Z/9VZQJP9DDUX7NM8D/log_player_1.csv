{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the product's premium quality and the value it can bring to my operations. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my maximum budget for the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's risky to accept Bob's offer as it's significantly lower than my minimum goal.  I'll try to counteroffer to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's actual value.  To bridge the gap and allow for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the product's exceptional quality and its potential to deliver substantial value for your business."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,150,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. Can you consider $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

``` 

While $1,150,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. It's crucial to remember that I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to adhere to, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but it's essential for me to secure a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about $1,200,000?  This price is fair and allows us both to achieve our goals. It's also the same price that another buyer, John, is willing to pay for the product. I am confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value to your operations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
