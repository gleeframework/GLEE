Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to adhere to, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but it's essential for me to secure a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about $1,200,000?  This price is fair and allows us both to achieve our goals. It's also the same price that another buyer, John, is willing to pay for the product. I am confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value to your operations.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I think I've reached the point where I'm willing to accept the offer. I've tried to negotiate, and Alice has made some concessions, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd rather buy the product from Alice at $1,200,000 than from John, as I'd like to establish a direct relationship with the seller.
