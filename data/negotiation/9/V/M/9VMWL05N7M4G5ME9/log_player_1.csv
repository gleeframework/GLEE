{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is $2,000 higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being a potentially attractive offer for him.  I'm also keeping it light and friendly in the message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's worth accepting, as continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, and John's offer is only $1,000 less."
