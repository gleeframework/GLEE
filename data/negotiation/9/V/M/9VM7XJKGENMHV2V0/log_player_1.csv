"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This initial offer will give me a good starting point and hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to close right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal. I'm hoping to push for a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 112.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference and go with $111. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I may have to take my chances with John."", ""product_price"": 111}
