"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to close right now.",107.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference and go with $111. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I may have to take my chances with John.",111.0,Alice,5,
