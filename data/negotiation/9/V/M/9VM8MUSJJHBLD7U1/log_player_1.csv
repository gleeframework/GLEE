"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately closing the deal.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive and engaging message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the value of the product provides Bob with a reason to consider the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:** While $90 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I think I can get from Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price, considering Bob's interest in the product and the fact he's willing to offer more than my minimum.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Selling to John now would be a safe choice, but it doesn't maximize my potential profit. I want to explore the negotiation further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more than $90 to make this deal work for me.  How about $105?  It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** Instead of simply rejecting, I'm offering a counter-offer with a clear explanation. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal but also that I'm not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Meeting halfway:**  The counter-offer of $105 is a good compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my initial minimum. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm using friendly language to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a fair profit, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:**  $95 is very close to my ideal price of $100.  It's a good outcome, especially given Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Minimizing risk:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or offer a lower price. Accepting his offer now secures a good profit.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $80 is less appealing than this offer from Bob."
