Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $145. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 
 
This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation, but still provides a decent profit for me. It's a starting point to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is far too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to compromise, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
