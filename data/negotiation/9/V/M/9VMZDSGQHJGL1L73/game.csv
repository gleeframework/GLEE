"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is far too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to compromise, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
