``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully earn more than my minimum of $1,200,000. I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I think I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a smaller step down from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my desired price. I'm happy to accept his offer of $1,420,000 and secure the deal. It's better than my fallback option with John and it minimizes the risk of further negotiations."
