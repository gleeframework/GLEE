{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

* I'm starting with my maximum acceptable price, which is the price John is offering. 
* This sets a clear boundary and allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, I'll know I'm likely not going to get a better price from her and should switch to John."
