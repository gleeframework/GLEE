Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $9,500 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($10,000), giving him an incentive to accept. 

This approach leaves room for negotiation, maximizing your chances of getting a price closer to Bob's value while still ensuring you earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get a price closer to $9,500.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,250.  This is a compromise: it's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility while still achieving a profitable price for me."
