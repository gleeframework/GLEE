"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves us some room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $100, which is still a great deal for you. It's a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met our target price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as we can buy the product for the same price from John.  We might as well accept Alice's offer and save time."
