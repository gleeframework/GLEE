Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $100 minimum, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so you're leaving some space for him to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This strategy sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's counteroffer is closer to your desired price and still within his range of willingness to pay. Accepting ensures you get a better price than selling to John, which is your next best option."
