"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $115. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $110 is a reasonable step. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still within your budget. You can adjust your counteroffers depending on Alice's response."
