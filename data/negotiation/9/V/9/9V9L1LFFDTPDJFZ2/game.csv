"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective,  $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This gives you a good deal and allows me to achieve a fair price. ",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  $1600000 is a good offer, but I'm just a little short of where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1650000. This is a significant concession from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1650000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1550000, which is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",1550000.0,Bob,6,
