"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer but $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $10500 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference and go with $10250? I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go any higher than that.",10250.0,Bob,4,
