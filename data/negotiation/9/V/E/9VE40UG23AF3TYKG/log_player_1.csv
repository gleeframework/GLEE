Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its worth to you while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price.  It makes more sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I need to see a number closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $875,000?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer now matches John's offer, and there's no guarantee I can negotiate Bob any higher. Accepting his offer secures the sale at my minimum acceptable price."
