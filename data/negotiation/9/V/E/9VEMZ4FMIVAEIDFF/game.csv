"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
