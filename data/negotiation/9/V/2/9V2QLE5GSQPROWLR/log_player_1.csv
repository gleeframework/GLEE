Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly unique and I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm confident it will bring you immense value.  I'm asking for $1,100,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's worth and potential value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of desire.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to counter.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining open to finding a mutually agreeable deal. It also sets the stage for a negotiation process, allowing me to assess Bob's willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** While Bob is interested, his offer is too far off. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **John is a Backup:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for that yet.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, keeping the negotiation moving towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's a fair value considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Fairness and Value:** I highlight the potential value for Bob, emphasizing that the price is fair considering the benefits he will receive.
* **Moving Forward:** I reiterate my desire to reach an agreement, showing I'm still invested in the negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to:
*  Show Bob I'm open to negotiation.
*  Keep the price close to my minimum while leaving room for further negotiation.
*  Keep Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Upside:** There's limited potential to increase the price further, and continued negotiation might risk losing Bob altogether.
* **Secure Option:** John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum.

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I believe it's more prudent to take the secure option and sell to John.  This ensures I meet my minimum profit goal and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a lower price."
