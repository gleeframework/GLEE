"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly unique and I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm confident it will bring you immense value.  I'm asking for $1,100,000 for it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's a fair value considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
