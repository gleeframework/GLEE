"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's far below my minimum price of $15,000 and even below what I'm willing to accept in the first round. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $10,000. It's still a good amount for me, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal.  There are still a few rounds left, and I want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway. I believe this might be a good compromise and we can close the deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is stuck at $9,000. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I've already lost a few rounds. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob, as I could run out of rounds. Selling to John guarantees me the best price, so I'll go with that option."
