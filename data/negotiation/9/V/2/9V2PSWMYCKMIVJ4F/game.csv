"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm happy to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and allows you to still get it for less than its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
