Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation of the product ($8,000), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).  This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I make a good profit ($11,000 - $8,000 = $3,000)
* **Minimize my risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price ($12,000)."
