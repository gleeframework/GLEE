"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in paying a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my ideal price point. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price of $11,500 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,250.  I'm hoping that this compromise will be enough to entice Bob to accept the offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my initial target than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I have more rounds left and don't want to settle for a price I'm not happy with just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm sticking to my guns and hoping to get closer to my target.  My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise, but I believe I can still get a price that's good for me while also giving Bob a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  I'm holding out for a slightly better price. I'm not sure if Bob will come up in his next offer, but I'm willing to risk it and see what happens."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm making a small compromise by lowering my price to $10,800. This is still above Bob's last offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. This is the last chance to get a better price from Bob, and if it doesn't work, I'm likely to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob has made several counteroffers that are below my minimum price. I've only got two rounds left and don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000."
