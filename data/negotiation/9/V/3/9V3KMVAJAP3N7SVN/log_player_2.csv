"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer to you. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with my minimum requirements. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. After reconsidering the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer to you. I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is consistently moving towards a middle ground. It's unlikely I'll secure a price significantly lower than $825,000, and risking John's $1,000,000 offer isn't worth the potential savings at this point."
