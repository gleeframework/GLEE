Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Let me know if this is something you can work with.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
