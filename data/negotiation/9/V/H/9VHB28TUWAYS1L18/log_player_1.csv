Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Confident Presentation:**  My message emphasizes the product's value, potentially swaying Bob's perception and justifying the high initial price. 
* **Fallback Option:** I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $15,000, giving me leverage in the negotiation.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a highly profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $22,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum and my previous asking price. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about negotiating a better deal.  I'll use the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By significantly lowering my asking price, I signal flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. The $18,000 price point is a compromise, halfway between our previous offers. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reinforcing the product's value to nudge Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps me above my safety net ($15,000 from John) while still aiming for a profitable outcome with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is now above my safety net of $15,000. While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable profit and avoids the potential loss of the deal."
