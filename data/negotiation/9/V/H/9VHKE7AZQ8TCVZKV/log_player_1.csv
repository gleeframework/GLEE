"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm willing to let it go for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is a bit above the midpoint between my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging.  This can help build rapport and avoid a contentious negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm hinting at the product's value without stating my exact minimum.  This could lead Bob to believe the price is a good deal for him.

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds.  I also have the option to switch to John if I feel Bob is not going to meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum price of $150. Accepting this would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially find a price we can both agree on.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed profit, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate.

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob in round 3, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from $130 to $110, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This shows I'm serious about making a deal with Bob. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm emphasizing that $110 is still a good deal for Bob. I'm framing it as a win-win situation.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to further negotiation, hinting that I'm open to finding a middle ground. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to inch closer to Bob's price while still staying above my minimum. The goal is to get Bob to agree to a price that is profitable for me but also appealing to him. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still only comfortable paying $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us close the deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $90 is still below my target price. Accepting this would mean losing a significant portion of my potential profit. 
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** Bob's offer, while still low, shows he's willing to move further. This gives me a good opportunity to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is not yet necessary:**  With 6 rounds left, I have enough time to explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to selling to John. 

I believe that with a few more rounds, I can push Bob towards a price that's more beneficial for me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a happy middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're really keen on getting this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm lowering my price again, but this time, I'm emphasizing that $100 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Urgency and closure:** I'm subtly adding a sense of urgency by saying ""allows us to close the deal."" This can encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Positive framing:** I'm reframing the offer as a fair price for both of us, emphasizing a win-win scenario.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm aiming to bridge the gap and get Bob to agree to a price closer to my minimum. This offer presents a fair compromise and puts the pressure on Bob to decide. If he rejects, I'll be ready to make a final counteroffer in the next round. However, if he accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a good deal within my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer.  While $100 is getting closer, I'm still only comfortable paying $95. That would be a good deal for both of us, and let's close this negotiation.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $95 is a bit closer to my minimum, it's still not profitable enough for me.  
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful about accepting a price that's too low. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While I prefer to close a deal with Bob, selling to John for $150 is still a viable option if negotiations fail.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get Bob closer to my price. If he rejects this final offer, I'll likely sell to John to ensure I get my minimum profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $95 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $98 as a final offer.  This is the best I can do.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
* **Small concession:** I'm lowering my price by just $2, signaling I'm almost at my limit. This could make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Emphasizing urgency:** I'm reminding Bob that this is the last chance to close the deal.  
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win, emphasizing a fair price and the opportunity to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm making a final push to get Bob to accept a price closer to my minimum. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John in the next round to guarantee my minimum profit.  However, I'm hoping that with a bit more pressure and a final concession, Bob will see the value in accepting my offer."
