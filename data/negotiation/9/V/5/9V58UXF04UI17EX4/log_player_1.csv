Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still attractive compared to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message's tone leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. If he's completely unwilling to budge, I can always fall back on my deal with John."
