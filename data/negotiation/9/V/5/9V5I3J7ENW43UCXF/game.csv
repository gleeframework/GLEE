"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in acquiring this product but need a price closer to $1200000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate further. While $1200000 is a significant price, it's below the true value of this product.  I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1500000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. I'm open to further discussion if you have any questions or concerns.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1350000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
