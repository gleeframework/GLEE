Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my assessment of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm lowering my price to $9,500. This is still a decent profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful sale."

Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his $8,000 offer.  Since I can sell to John for the same price, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
