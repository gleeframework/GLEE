"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within his budget. This is a strong opening move that shows Bob is serious about negotiating a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a little closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $105 counteroffer. While $110 is closer to his budget, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a potential lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $108. That's a fair compromise, considering we're both looking for a good deal."", ""product_price"": 108} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but still below Alice's latest offer.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect,  putting pressure on Alice to accept."
