"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob by mentioning his perceived value.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

I'm confident this approach will maximize my chances of securing a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $9,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for $9,000 just yet. I believe I can still get a better price through further negotiation. 

I'm rejecting his offer to keep the negotiation going and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This would still leave you a decent profit margin, and it's a fair compromise considering my own investment in this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired price, but still appealing to Bob. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation helps maintain a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to counteroffer at $10,000. I believe this price strikes a good balance between fairness and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is very close to my desired price point, and I believe further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and clean sale, and it's still a much better price than selling to John for $15,000."
