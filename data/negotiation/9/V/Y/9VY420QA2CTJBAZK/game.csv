"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're working within a budget, but considering the value of this product, I'd be willing to go down to $13,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to meet my own needs.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $11,500 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $12,250? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",12250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,250 is still a bit too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but this product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. I'm willing to come down to $12,750, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not comfortable going above $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,
