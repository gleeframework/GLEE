"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $100? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90. This would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $95? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",95.0,Alice,5,
