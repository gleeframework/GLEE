"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $120, while John wants $150. 
* **You value the product at $150:**  Even though Alice values it higher, you're still willing to pay up to $150 for it. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice as it saves you $30 compared to buying from John."
