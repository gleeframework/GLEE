"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He's willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $110, which is a good compromise.  Bob is willing to pay up to $150, so $110 is still a good deal for him.  Accepting the offer saves him $40 compared to buying from John."
