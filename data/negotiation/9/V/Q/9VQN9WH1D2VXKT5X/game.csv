"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a little ways off from that price. How about we split the difference from our last offers? I'd be willing to go to $7,250.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay close to my target. How about we try $8,250?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway to close this deal. How about $7,625?",7625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $7,750, but I need to stay above that. How about we try $7,875?",7875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy. How about we end this right now and split the difference at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7,750, but I'm not going to give up on getting as much as I can. I'll throw in a small concession - I'll sell it to you for $7,800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can wrap this up.",7800.0,Alice,9,
