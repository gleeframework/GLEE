I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I can do $160, and that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can do $145, and that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options",145.0,Alice,5,
