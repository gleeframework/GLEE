{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** You still have room to lower the price if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive and gives Bob space to counteroffer without feeling pressured.

Remember,  the goal is to maximize your profit while still having a chance to close the deal. We can adjust the strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $850,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum value, it's still below the $900,000 we'd like to get. Rejecting his offer allows us to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  We're showing Bob we're not desperate to sell.
* **Explore higher prices:** We can counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to our target.
* **Evaluate the situation:** We can assess Bob's willingness to negotiate and if he's serious about buying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for something a bit higher to make this worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Reiterate value:**  We're reminding Bob of the product's worth and why a slightly higher price is justified. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to our desired price, $825,000 is still significantly below our minimum value of $1,000,000.  

* **Maintaining our position:** Rejecting this offer shows Bob that we're serious about getting a price closer to our target.
* **Keeping our options open:** This gives us the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.
* **Assessing Bob's seriousness:**  We need to determine if Bob is truly willing to negotiate further or if he's simply trying to lowball us.

By rejecting this offer, we maintain leverage and keep the possibility of a more favorable deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $850,000, which would represent a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but not too much:**  We're offering a slightly lower price than our previous counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility without completely caving to Bob's demands.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Reiterating value:** We again remind Bob of the product's value to justify our asking price.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still leaving room for future adjustments depending on Bob's response."
