You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the $11,000 offer is just too far off from what I have in mind.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, but that's my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her lowest price of $15,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. You can secure the product for $12,000 from John, which is the best option in this scenario."
