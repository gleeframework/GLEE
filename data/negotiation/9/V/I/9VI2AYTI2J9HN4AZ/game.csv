"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for my budget, though. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $11,000? I feel that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the $11,000 offer is just too far off from what I have in mind.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, but that's my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",15000.0,Alice,5,
