"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high to me.  How about we start the negotiations at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things forward, I can go down to $900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer!  I can see we're both motivated to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price acknowledges the value you're gaining while fairly compensating me for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I think we can close this deal now.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're a tough negotiator, I'll give you that!  Let's wrap this up.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, my final offer. This is a fantastic deal for you considering what you'll gain.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While your final offer is tempting, I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  To be fair to us both, I propose a final offer of $775,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,8,
