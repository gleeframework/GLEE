Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Let's try to bridge the gap further.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and makes this a worthwhile purchase for both of us.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, the offers are escalating too slowly. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies me before his offers become too low to consider. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price."
