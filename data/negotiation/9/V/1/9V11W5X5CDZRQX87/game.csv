"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a better price for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,150,000?  That's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,125,000? I think this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. I'm confident in the value of this product, and I'm willing to go a little further to make this work for both of us. How about we settle on $1,140,000? This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal, and I believe it represents a good value for both parties. Let me know what you think.",1140000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still holding out for a higher price, Alice, but I'm getting close to my maximum budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,120,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1120000.0,Bob,6,
