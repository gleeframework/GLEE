"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $700,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land closer to my budget. Could we agree on $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",650000.0,Alice,5,
