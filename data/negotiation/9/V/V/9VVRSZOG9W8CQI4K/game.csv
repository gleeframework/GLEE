"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product and believe it has real value, but I'm only able to offer $900000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this price is still a good deal for you, considering the potential benefits of owning this product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value and my budget. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire this valuable product while ensuring you receive a reasonable sale.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is still a bit below my minimum asking price. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000, which is the closest I can get to my minimum asking price. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
