It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a backup option with John, you can afford to be a bit more aggressive in your negotiation with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $80. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal."

While $97 is tempting, I'm still within my budget with John's offer. I'll see if I can push Alice a bit lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on her last offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay more than $90."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $98.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting stubborn, and I'm running out of rounds. At this point, it's better to buy from John, who's offering a consistent price, to avoid risking getting stuck with a higher price."
