"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential profit.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, this offer is still attractive to him.  However, it leaves room for negotiation if he wants to push for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500.  This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer once more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $12,750. This is a significant concession,  showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but it still allows me to get a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a higher price.  The negotiation is getting tense, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll counteroffer one more time before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $12,000.  This is getting very close to Bob's last offer and my minimum price.  I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to accept. However, if he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation is not going in my favor.  Bob's latest offer is only $1,000 above my minimum, and with only two rounds left, I doubt we'll reach a better agreement.  I'm better off accepting John's offer and securing a guaranteed $10,000."
