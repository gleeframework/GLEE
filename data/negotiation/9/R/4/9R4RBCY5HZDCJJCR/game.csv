"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $160 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $150. I'm really interested in this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet at $155? It's a small compromise, but I'm willing to consider it.",155.0,Alice,5,
