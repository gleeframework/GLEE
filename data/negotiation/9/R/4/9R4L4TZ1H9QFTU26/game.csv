"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting with an offer of $1200000. This reflects the product's unique value and potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  Considering its unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is still well within a reasonable range and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the unique features and potential of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm offering $1000000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value.  I hope you'll agree to this final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
