"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. This is a fantastic deal considering what you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high. Rejecting her offer opens the door to counter-offering or seeing if she'll come down in price. You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000 if needed."
