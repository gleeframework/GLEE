"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I value this product, $11,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price that allows for a profit for you while staying within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is a good compromise. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,750 is tempting, it's still a bit above what I can comfortably pay right now.  I'm prepared to pay $10,250.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will allow us both to walk away satisfied.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500 again, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll include a free upgrade that's worth $500. So, the total price would be $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
