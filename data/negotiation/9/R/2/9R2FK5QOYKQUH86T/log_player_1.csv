I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I hope this will be attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his price, and I've already lowered my offer once. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.  It's time to move on and sell to John, securing my minimum value."
