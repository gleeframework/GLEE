"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000 to you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves a comfortable margin for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise that lets us both walk away happy. What do you say?",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,280,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,220,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget and make this deal work, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product to me.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
