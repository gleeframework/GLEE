"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 simply isn't a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for what I'm offering.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $975,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,012,500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's the best deal we can both get.  What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
