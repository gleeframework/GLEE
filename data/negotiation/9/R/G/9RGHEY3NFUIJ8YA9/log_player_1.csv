"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is still a profit, I'm aiming for a higher price. I will counteroffer and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.  This offer is still a good profit for me and is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and Bob seems to be willing to pay close to my minimum. Accepting his offer of $11,500 guarantees a sale and a decent profit.  Selling to John for $12,000 might be a bit more, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
