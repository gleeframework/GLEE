"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe it holds great value for you, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. My initial price is $900,000. This reflects the product's unique features and the benefits it offers. I'm open to discussing this further, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $850,000, which reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $850,000 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer.  While $775,000 is still a bit below my desired price, I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product, and it's a great opportunity for you.  Let's close this deal!",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate the movement you've made on the price.  To be honest, my absolute top end is $800,000.  If you can do that, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
