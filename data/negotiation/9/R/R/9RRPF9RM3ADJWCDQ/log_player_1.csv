"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By setting the initial price at $175, it gives Bob room to counter-offer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($150).**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I can counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can find a middle ground.
* **I'm not in a hurry to sell.** I have the option to sell to John, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is just too low for me. How about $155? That's a significant discount from my original offer and still a fair price for this valuable product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  I'm lowering my price to $155, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to remind Bob that $155 is still a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $145 as my offer for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($150).** Even though he's gotten closer, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.
* **There are only 6 rounds left.**  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement, and I'll be left with no sale.
* **John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price.**  This is the safer option, ensuring I get my desired amount for the product."
