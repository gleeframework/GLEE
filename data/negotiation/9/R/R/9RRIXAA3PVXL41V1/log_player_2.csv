"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is way above his budget and he can get the same product from John for $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but Bob needs to be prepared to walk away if the price doesn't come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1000000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1750000.  This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant decrease from the initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, making it a better deal.  There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and he should continue to try to get the price down."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and he should continue to try to get the price down.  He can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.
