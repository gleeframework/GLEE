"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high with $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate and also allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can make a smaller counteroffer, but if he accepts, I've already made a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't sell for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum. This is the best outcome for me without risking further negotiation."
