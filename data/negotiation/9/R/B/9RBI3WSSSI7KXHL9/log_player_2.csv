"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's worth more than that to you, and it's definitely worth more than the $10,000 I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still higher than what you could get the product for from John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with purchasing from John at a lower cost."
