"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $95 is above Bob's maximum of $80.  While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, it's always better to have a backup plan.  

By rejecting the offer and going to the next round, Bob can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down closer to his price point. However, if Alice doesn't budge, Bob can always buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's still above his absolute maximum, but closer to his desired price.  This approach allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate without risking a complete deal breakdown.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can still walk away and buy from John, but there's a chance Alice will see $85 as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still above Bob's maximum of $80, and while it's closer, it's not worth accepting. Bob has a guaranteed alternative at $80 with John.  It's better to continue negotiating to try and get a better price, knowing that he can always go to John if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still capped at $85.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal now.  Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $85. He's reiterating that this is his limit, but he's also leaving the door open for a quick deal. If Alice is willing to accept, it saves both of them time and effort. However, he's still prepared to go to John if Alice doesn't budge. This strategy keeps the pressure on Alice to make a concession while maintaining Bob's fallback option."
