Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a little in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500. It's a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $15,500 is a good price, and it's closer to my goal than John's offer.  It's important to remember that I have limited rounds and need to strike a balance between maximizing profit and avoiding losing the deal completely."
