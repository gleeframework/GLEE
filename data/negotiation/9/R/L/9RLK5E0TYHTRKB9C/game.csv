"Hi Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500. It's a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
