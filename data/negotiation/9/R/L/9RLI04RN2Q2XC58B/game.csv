,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1750000? This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while showing you some flexibility.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my financial situation, $1750000 is still beyond my budget. I am willing to offer $1600000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more within your range.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
