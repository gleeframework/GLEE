Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, starting high gives me leverage. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold, and I still have the option to sell to John for $800,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering $900,000, which is still above my minimum threshold but shows flexibility.  This counteroffer  shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to drop below my target price just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and is a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk losing Bob entirely. It's a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it."
