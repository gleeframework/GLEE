"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's budget, although closer. Bob can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's no need to rush into buying from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still $500 higher than what John is offering.  It's worth seeing if Bob can negotiate further down before buying from John.  There's still a chance Alice might drop her price to $10,000 or less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get the product for $10,000. That would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the product for $10000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10200. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still $200 higher than John's offer. With only three rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiations is high.  It's likely that Alice won't drop her price further, and Bob could end up paying more than John's offer.  Buying from John at $10,000 is the safest and most cost-effective choice at this point."
