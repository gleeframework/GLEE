"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is less than the $1,500,000 Jhon is asking, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive while still remaining within a reasonable range. He knows Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so this offer leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a lower price but recognizes the need to compromise. This offer is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still higher than he'd like to pay.  At this point, Bob has to decide if the potential savings from further negotiation are worth the risk of Alice rejecting his next offer. 

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, it's more prudent for him to buy from John at that price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice. This ensures he gets the product and avoids the risk of a deal falling through."
