{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above your minimum ($80) but still lower than what Bob is willing to pay. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially lead to a negotiation that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell it for less than $80. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $85? I think this is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to get a decent price for the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $70 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $77 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $77 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81? That way we both get a fair deal, and I can still make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 81}
