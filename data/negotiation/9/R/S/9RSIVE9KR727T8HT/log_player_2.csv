Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and this counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum acceptable price.  This makes it a reasonable offer that Alice might be willing to consider."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,000,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price."
