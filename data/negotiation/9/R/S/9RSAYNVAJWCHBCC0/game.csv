"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it seems nice, $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $90 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. How about we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $85. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
