"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is way over his budget. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice, and if that fails, he can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I have in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit too high. Bob should try to negotiate further and potentially get the price closer to his desired $8,500 before considering buying from John."
