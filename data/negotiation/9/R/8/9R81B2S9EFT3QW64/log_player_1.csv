Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's low initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his low offer.  While I could continue to counteroffer, there's no guarantee he'll change his mind.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get a reasonable price and don't risk wasting more time on a fruitless negotiation."
