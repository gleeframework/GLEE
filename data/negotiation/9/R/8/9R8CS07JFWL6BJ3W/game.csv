"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer on this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think $11000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $11500. I'm willing to offer $9000 again, but this time it's not a negotiable price. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
