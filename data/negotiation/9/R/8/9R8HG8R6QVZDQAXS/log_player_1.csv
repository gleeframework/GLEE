Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't sell for less than that.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so I want to get as close to my value as possible while still being attractive to him.
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $14,000 leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can still make a counteroffer or choose to sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can still try to get a better price by counteroffering, as I have the option to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I am not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My previous offer of $14,000 was rejected, so I'm willing to compromise a little bit.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $12,500 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation if Bob rejects it, while still being significantly higher than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:**  We've been going back and forth, and Bob's offer of $11,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and energy, potentially lowering my potential earnings.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoids any further risk of a lower offer from Bob."
