Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little further and offer you the product for $890,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 890000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We're very close to my target price, and there's a chance he'll walk away if I counteroffer again. It's better to secure the deal and get $885,000 than risk losing him and having to settle with John for $800,000."
