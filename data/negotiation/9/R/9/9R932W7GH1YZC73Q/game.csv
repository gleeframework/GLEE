"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $11,000?  That's about the most I can justify spending.",11000.0,Bob,4,
