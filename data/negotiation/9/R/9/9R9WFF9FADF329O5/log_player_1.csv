"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic opportunity and I'm confident it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum value, I'm still within the negotiation phase and there's potential to get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can get a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,250 is getting close to my desired price and the negotiation is moving in the right direction. I'm not guaranteed a better offer in the next round, so I'll take this deal."
