I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price from him.  I'm hoping to close the deal at $110 or $115 in the next round.  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I want to maximize my profits."

I'm choosing to sell to John for $120.  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, the potential gains are getting smaller.  I've already gone through five rounds and I don't want to risk running out of time and ending up with a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's above my minimum."
