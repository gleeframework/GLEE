"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  While the price is high, I'm framing it as fair considering the product's value, which may encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. Considering the value to me, I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to reach a deal. 
* **Seeking a better outcome:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm aiming to maximize my profit. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially secure a better deal in the upcoming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but staying engaged in the negotiation.
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The offer aims to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer, potentially leading to a faster agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, there's a risk of losing the deal if I keep rejecting offers. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in round 4, and each rejection increases the chance of the deal falling through.
* **Safe Option:** Accepting this offer secures a sale that is just slightly below my minimum, and still significantly more profitable than selling to John.

**By accepting Bob's offer, I'm balancing the need for a good price with the urgency of securing a deal within the allotted rounds.**"
