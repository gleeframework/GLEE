Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly above the midpoint between your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's valuation leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob might reject the offer if he perceives it as too high. However, the potential gain from a successful sale at $1,150,000 outweighs settling for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
