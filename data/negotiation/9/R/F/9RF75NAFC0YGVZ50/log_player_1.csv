As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the market value and my budget, I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
