Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $150 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still remaining above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  By highlighting the ""value"" of the product, we might persuade Bob even though his perceived value is lower than our asking price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a sale above our minimum."
