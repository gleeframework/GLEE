"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product is worth a lot more based on its features and benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a little bit.  While I agree the product has value, $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I'm trying my best to make this work, but $9,000 is still a bit beyond what I budgeted for.  Could we settle on $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
