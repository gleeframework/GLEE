"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. He has a clear goal to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there is still room for negotiation and potential savings. By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the value of the product to me, $850,000 would be a fair price.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to pay less, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still gives you a great deal, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget of $1,000,000 and the fact that he can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  By accepting, Bob saves $100,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, accepting this offer ensures a purchase at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially falling apart."
