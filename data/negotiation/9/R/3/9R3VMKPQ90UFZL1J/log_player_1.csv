Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum of $120.
* **It's within Bob's range:** Bob values the product at $100, so he might be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There is space for both of you to adjust the price. 

This strategy balances getting a good price with keeping the negotiation open. You'll see how Bob responds and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is below your minimum of $120. While it's tempting to take the offer since it's close to Bob's valuation, you're better off rejecting and trying to get a better price.  

**Reasoning:**

* **You have a better option:** John is willing to pay $120, so accepting Bob's offer would leave money on the table.
* **You can still get a higher price:** Bob is interested in the product and has made a counteroffer, indicating he's willing to negotiate further.
* **You have leverage:**  You can leverage John's offer as a way to encourage Bob to increase his bid. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain your position and have the potential to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I can't go as low as $105, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110?  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $105. It's fair to both of us and allows us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has repeated his offer of $105.  While he's clearly interested in the product, he's not willing to budge on his price. You've already tried to meet him halfway with your counteroffer, and it appears he's firm on his position. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks prolonging the process, potentially losing valuable time.
* **John offers a better deal:** John is guaranteed to pay $120, providing a more profitable outcome compared to Bob's offer. 
* **Minimizing risk:** While there's a chance you could convince Bob to increase his offer, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with him outweighs the potential reward.

By selling to John, you ensure a quick and profitable transaction, maximizing your earnings in this scenario."
