Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup over my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it gives Bob room to negotiate if he's interested.  If he rejects the offer, I'll sell it to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000.  This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving room for a successful transaction with Bob."
