Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and become a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's more than double my maximum budget.  I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000.  I'd like to start with a counteroffer of $600,000, a price that reflects a significant discount and leaves room for negotiation.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and for countering. While I understand your perspective, the $600,000 offer significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised price better reflects the inherent value and the substantial returns you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still way too high. While she's come down a bit, it's still significantly above my budget. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a significant distance from what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a much more realistic price point for me.  This would be a considerable gain for you compared to selling to John, and it would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but $750,000 is still too low.  How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?  This reflects my effort to reach a deal while still acknowledging the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to pay over $800,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This offer is a win-win â€“ you'd still be making a profit, and I'd be acquiring the product at a price I can comfortably afford. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
