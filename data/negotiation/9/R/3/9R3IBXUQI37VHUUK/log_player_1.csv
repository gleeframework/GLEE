{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, giving me room to negotiate downwards.  It's also important to be friendly and encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.  If Bob rejects, I can analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on his willingness to pay and the value of continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. Bob clearly thinks the product is worth something, but he's trying to get a great deal. By rejecting his offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000? This would allow me to make the sale while still getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to get a very low price. While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying this product, let's see if we can reach an agreement.  "", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $8500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $7750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly pushing for a low price, and I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I don't want to risk going lower.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price, and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price."
