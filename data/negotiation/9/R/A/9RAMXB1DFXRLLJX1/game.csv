"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers and land at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer.  However, $775,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise and keeps this negotiation moving forward.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",825000.0,Alice,5,
