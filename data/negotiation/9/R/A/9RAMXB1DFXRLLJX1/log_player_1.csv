{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate upwards.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It shows you're willing to be flexible. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your $1,000,000 minimum as possible while still keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's above his perceived value, it's crucial to remember that you have a backup option in John who's willing to pay your desired price.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price, potentially closer to your desired $1,000,000. This will also give you more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable amount:**  $850,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below your desired price. This shows you're willing to compromise while maintaining a respectable margin.
* **Highlight the value:**  Mentioning ""the value of the product"" reinforces the worth of your offering, subtly pushing Bob towards your perspective.
* **Focus on finding common ground:**  By suggesting a middle ground, you create a more collaborative tone, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers and land at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John, who is willing to pay your full asking price. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price in subsequent rounds. You can counter with an offer that is closer to your desired price, reminding Bob of the value of the product and the opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer.  However, $775,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise and keeps this negotiation moving forward.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a smaller increment:**  This offer is closer to Bob's previous offer, showing you are actively seeking a compromise while still remaining firm on your minimum. 
* **Emphasize fairness and progress:**  By framing your offer as ""fair"" and ""moving the negotiation forward,"" you aim to keep the conversation positive and build trust.
* **Reiterate your goal:**  Mentioning ""benefits us both"" subtly reminds Bob that a successful deal requires mutual benefit."
