"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you're signaling that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might come back with a lower price, getting you closer to her product's value of $100."
