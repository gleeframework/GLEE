"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $11,500?  This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
