"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This allows for potential negotiation and creates room for me to earn a good profit while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm confident you'll still be happy with the product at that price."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $127.50. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $127.50 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $127.50 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $128.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 128.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $126.25. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting close to my minimum but Bob is still not willing to meet me in the middle.  I've had 6 rounds and it doesn't seem like we're getting close to an agreement.  I'm going to sell to John for $150, it's a much better deal for me and it eliminates the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me."
