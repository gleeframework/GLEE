"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm confident you'll still be happy with the product at that price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $127.50. Can you meet me there?,127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $127.50 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $128.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",128.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $126.25. Can you consider that?,126.25,Bob,6,
