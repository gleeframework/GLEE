Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $11,500?  It's a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $11,200?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I need, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might lose him as a buyer.  Plus, I'm running out of rounds."
