"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's under your $1,000,000 limit, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Potential for savings:**  There are 9 rounds left, allowing for multiple counteroffers. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Buying from John right away is a guaranteed deal but leaves no room for negotiation. 

By rejecting the initial offer, you open the possibility of securing the product for a lower price without the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still acknowledges the value of the product to her.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $850,000, there's still room for Alice to make a counteroffer that would leave both of us satisfied.
* **Strategic Play:**  This strong counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal and sets the tone for a negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Although she's come down from her initial price, $920,000 is still above my target.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** There are still 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. This means there's potential to secure a better price.
* **Buying from John is not a good option yet:** While I'm approaching my limit, it's better to continue negotiating for a lower price with Alice rather than settle for the full price with John.

By rejecting Alice's offer, I maintain the leverage to continue pushing for a more favorable deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's latest offer of $920,000. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Increasing Pressure:** With each round, the pressure on Alice to close the deal increases. This offer puts her on notice that I'm not willing to go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  $900,000 is still above my target price, and with 5 rounds left, there's still room for improvement.
* **Alice is showing flexibility:**  She's consistently lowering her price, indicating that she's motivated to close the deal. This increases my confidence that I can push for a lower price.
* **Risk of buying from John:**  While the pressure to close is mounting, I'm not yet willing to settle for the full $1,000,000 with John. There's a good chance I can get a better deal with Alice.

By rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation, I maintain my position of leverage and increase the chances of getting the product at a price closer to my desired target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to a deal:** Alice has lowered her price consistently, and we're nearing a price that's acceptable for both of us. 
* **Testing the waters:** Offering $890,000 is a small increase from my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a slightly lower price. 
* **Time pressure:** We are at round 6, and the pressure to reach an agreement is increasing. This small increment in my offer indicates that I am getting close to my limit.

By offering a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially close the deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $885,000 is very close to my ideal price range and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is high.  There's a chance Alice may become more stubborn or the deal could fall apart.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While I could try to push for $880,000 or $882,000, it's not guaranteed that Alice would accept a lower offer. The risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for small additional savings.

Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and still achieves a substantial discount compared to the alternative."
