"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.**
* **Your maximum price is $150.**
* **You can get the product from John for $150.** 

Since you can get the product from John for your maximum price, rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with John or find another seller."
