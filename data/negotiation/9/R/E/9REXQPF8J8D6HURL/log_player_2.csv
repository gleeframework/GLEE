# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I can sell the product to you for $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice is consistently meeting in the middle, and the difference is now quite small. It's unlikely further haggling will result in significant savings, and it risks alienating Alice. Accepting at $1,012,500 secures a good deal."
