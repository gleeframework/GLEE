Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value and the interest I've had in it, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  However, I'm open to discussing a figure that works well for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and even your minimum ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.  If he immediately balks, you know he's price-sensitive. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique value"" and ""interest from others"" creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Expressing willingness to discuss the price shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counter-offer.
* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  While aiming for more than your minimum is ideal, setting the initial price too high might discourage Bob from engaging altogether.

**Important Note:**  You have a strong fallback position with John ($15,000 guaranteed), so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your negotiation with Bob."
