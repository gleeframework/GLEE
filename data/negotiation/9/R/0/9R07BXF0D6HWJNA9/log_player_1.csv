Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I won't go below $12,000, as I can always sell to John for that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I would prefer to sell to Bob and avoid dealing with John, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $9,500. This is still a good price for me, as it's closer to my desired price point. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects my offer again. I'm hoping that he will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my ideal price point. While I would prefer to get $9,500, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  The potential for further negotiations is low, and selling to John is still an option if Bob continues to decline."
