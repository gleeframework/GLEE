Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,300,000 to make it worth my while. Can we discuss this further?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price. Although she has moved closer to my counteroffer, I still believe there is room for negotiation.  I'll continue to try and lower the price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need $1,200,000 to be able to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $1,220,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still above my preferred range.  I'm determined to save as much money as possible, so I'll try to negotiate further in the next round.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to buy from John if the price remains too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but  $1,220,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,160,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this, I'm eager to get this product."", ""product_price"": 1160000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,160,000 is enough to justify the sale. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,180,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, and her offer is now within my acceptable range. While I would prefer a lower price, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product for me at a price that is still within my budget."
