"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,300,000 to make it worth my while. Can we discuss this further?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's get this deal done.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need $1,200,000 to be able to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $1,220,000?",1220000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but  $1,220,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,160,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this, I'm eager to get this product.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,160,000 is enough to justify the sale. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,180,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
