Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting high allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum. A price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still netting you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Exclusivity:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" to make the offer more enticing. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential reward of a much higher sale price justifies aiming high in this scenario."
