"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would allow for a fair price for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
