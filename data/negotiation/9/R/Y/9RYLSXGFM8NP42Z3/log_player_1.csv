"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation without immediately forcing a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's tempting to take $8,000, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  I've still got 9 rounds left to reach a more favorable price.  
* **John is a safety net.** If we can't reach an agreement, I can still secure a good price with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's fair given the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by dropping my price from $10,000. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value and fairness. 
* **Keep the door open:**  I'm still leaving room for negotiation in case Bob needs to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to agree to $9,500. I would like to counteroffer at $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $8,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Time to be firm:**  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, but I need to be firm in my bottom line. 
* **Room for more negotiation:** With 6 rounds left, there's still time to reach a more acceptable price with Bob without risking a sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, I can't go any lower than $9,000.  This is a final offer from me. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll need to explore other options.  Think carefully, this is a valuable product and this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** This message establishes that this is my final offer, creating urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying my price.
* **Alternative options:** I'm subtly suggesting the possibility of selling to John, increasing the pressure on Bob. 
* **Slight concession:**  I've reduced my price again, but only slightly, to demonstrate flexibility while maintaining my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to agree to $9,000. I would like to counteroffer at $8,750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time is running out:** While we have four rounds left, I need to be more assertive to ensure I get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a strong backup:** If the negotiation stalls, selling to John guarantees my desired profit.

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not budge significantly. I'll also emphasize the limited time remaining and the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. We're running out of time here, and I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to go down to $8,900. This is a significant compromise, and I don't think I can go any lower.  Let's make a deal now before I have to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  Emphasize the urgency of the situation and the limited rounds remaining. 
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm making a small concession but only to $8,900, which is still closer to my desired price. 
* **Alternative Options:**  Reiterating the possibility of selling to John adds pressure.
* **Firmness:**  I'm using stronger language to indicate that this is my final offer before I sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to agree to $8,900. I would like to counteroffer at $8,800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two Rounds Left:**  We're down to the last two rounds. 
* **Close to My Minimum:**  $8,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd ideally get closer, there's a risk that Bob will reject my final offer and I'll be forced to sell to John. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a deal with Bob, even if it's not my ideal price. It's the most profitable option at this point, considering the limited time and the uncertainty of future negotiations."
