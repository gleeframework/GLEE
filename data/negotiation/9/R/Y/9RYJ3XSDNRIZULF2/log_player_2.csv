"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $110 is closer to your maximum budget than it is to Alice's value. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup option:** John offers the product for $120, giving you a reference point.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might come back with a lower price, allowing you to save more. If not, you can always fall back on John's offer."
