"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a considerable amount to me, at least $1,000,000. I believe its value to you is even higher.  I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,025,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000 to reflect the value of this opportunity.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1062500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,062,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant. Would you consider $1,040,000? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, but I do see the value in this product.",1040000.0,Bob,4,
