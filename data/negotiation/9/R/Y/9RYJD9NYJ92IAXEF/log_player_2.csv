"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is worse:**  If you reject, you'll have to buy from John for $120, which is more expensive."
