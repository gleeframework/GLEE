Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $100.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $170.  I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 170}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $170 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to $150, but I'm still only comfortable going up to $125.  Let's meet in the middle.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $150.  You have a guaranteed offer from John, so it's more profitable to sell to John at this point."
