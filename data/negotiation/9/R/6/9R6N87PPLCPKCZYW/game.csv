"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $500000 to $1000000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $750000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to facilitate this deal.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to recoup a portion of the value. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my financial situation, I am comfortable moving forward with a purchase price of $900000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still significantly below the value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1000000 for the product. This represents a compromise on both our ends and allows us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
