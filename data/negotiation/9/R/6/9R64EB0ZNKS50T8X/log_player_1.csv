{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's still advantageous to me, but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe $115 is a fair starting point, and hopefully Bob will see the value in the product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still far from my desired price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and see if we can find a more suitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $108 is not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum threshold of $120. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $108."
