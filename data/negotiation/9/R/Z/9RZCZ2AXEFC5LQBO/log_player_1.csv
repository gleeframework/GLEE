Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can potentially lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out.  A good strategy is to start high but leave some room for negotiation. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This anchors the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  You've left space to come down if Bob negotiates.
* **Positive Language:**  Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair offer"" create a more collaborative tone.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Market Conditions:** If the market is hot and you think there might be other buyers willing to pay even more than John, you could consider a more aggressive opening price.

**Remember:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response."
