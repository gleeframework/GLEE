Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $12,000 (You'll sell to John for this)
* **Bob's Value:** $10,000 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $10,000 and $12,000

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price as close to $12,000 as possible without alienating Bob. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its unique features and value, I'm pricing it at $11,500. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $11,500 sets a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land within the ZOPA.
* **Confident Tone:**  Don't apologize for the price. Frame it as a valuable opportunity.
* **Focus on Value:** Briefly highlight the product's benefits to justify the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob counters, be willing to come down slightly, but always keep your reservation price in mind. You have a strong position, so don't settle for anything less than what you deserve!"
