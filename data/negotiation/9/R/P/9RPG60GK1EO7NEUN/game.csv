"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher than that. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Bob,4,
