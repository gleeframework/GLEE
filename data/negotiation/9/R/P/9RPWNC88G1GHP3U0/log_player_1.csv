Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500.
