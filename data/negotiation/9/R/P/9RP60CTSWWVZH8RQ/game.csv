"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested.  $80 is a bit too low for me, though.  How about we split the difference and I let it go for $115?  That's a fair price, considering what it's worth to me.",115.0,Alice,3,
