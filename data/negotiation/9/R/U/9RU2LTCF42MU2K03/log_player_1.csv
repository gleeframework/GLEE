Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $119, you're leaving a single dollar on the table for Bob. This makes it very likely he'll accept, as he gains a small surplus ($1) compared to his perceived value. 
* **Backup Plan:**  While you have John as a backup buyer, it's always better to secure the higher price if possible. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
