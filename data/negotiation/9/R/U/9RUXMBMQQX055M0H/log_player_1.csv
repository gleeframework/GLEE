Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant value it holds."", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point and leaves room for concessions. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial high price allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. His response will reveal how much he values the product and how flexible he might be. 
* **Backup Plan:** I always have John as a secure backup option, guaranteeing me at least $1,500,000. This knowledge empowers me to be firmer in my negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum price and his perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. Proceeding to the next round allows me to negotiate towards a more favorable price. I'm confident that there's room for a deal that benefits both of us, given the large gap between his offer and my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the offer of $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's potential. How about we consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fairer starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** While I've dropped significantly from my initial offer, I remain well above my $1,500,000 minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Encouraging Dialogue:**  The phrasing ""fairer starting point"" signals openness to negotiation without drastically undercutting my position.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a price point where both parties feel there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but so does my budget. $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?  This is a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. His latest offer suggests that his willingness to pay might be capped around this level.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a satisfactory outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of protracted negotiations that might not lead to a significantly better deal."
