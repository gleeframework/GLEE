"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant value it holds.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's potential. How about we consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fairer starting point for further discussion.
