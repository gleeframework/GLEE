"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can likely get a better price than $130, as the product is only worth $120 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to make a counteroffer and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point as it splits the difference between Alice's asking price and your maximum willingness to pay. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

```

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still above what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. You can also consider offering a price closer to $130 to try to find a compromise."

Since Alice rejected your previous offer of $125, it's time to meet her halfway. This counteroffer is a compromise that's still within your budget and might convince Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $132, which is a reasonable price considering your maximum willingness to pay is $150.  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking a higher cost from John."
