"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you at $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product at $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position on the price. While I do value the product, $9,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, Bob. I'm willing to make a compromise at $9,500, as I mentioned before. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $9,250. This is my final offer for now.",9250.0,Alice,5,
