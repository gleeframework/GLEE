Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will pay $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for negotiation room while still securing a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room to potentially decrease the price slightly if Bob negotiates, while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price."
