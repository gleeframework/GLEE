# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1100000. This represents a significant value for you, as it's still lower than what it's worth to you.  I'm confident you'll see the benefits of this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
