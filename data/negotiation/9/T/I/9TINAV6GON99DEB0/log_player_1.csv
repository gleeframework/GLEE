"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's  significantly higher than my minimum but still below Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate while also ensuring a good profit.  I'm being friendly and  highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to negotiate a price closer to $8,000. I believe we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low for me. I'm not going to accept that. I have 9 more rounds to get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you negotiating, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500?  It's still a great price for a product that's worth a lot to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm still aiming for a good profit, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down a bit from my initial offer.  I'm also emphasizing the value to Bob again to remind him of the good deal he's getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $9,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal to John.  Accepting this offer will give me a good profit, so I'm going to take it."
