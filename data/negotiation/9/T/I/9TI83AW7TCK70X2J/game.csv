"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $920000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $915000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $915000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920000 and $915000, which would be $917500. Can you consider that?",917500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $917500. I think the product's value is worth more than that. Let's try $918000. It's a small increase, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and the value it can bring to you. What do you think?",918000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $918000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $915000 is as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",915000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $915000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's try one last time with $916500. It's a small increase, but I believe it's the minimum I can accept. What do you think?",916500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $915000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",915000.0,Bob,10,
