I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves a significant margin for both of us. It's also higher than John's offer, ensuring that I'm getting a better deal than selling to him.  Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better. Bob clearly values the product at $1,500,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap and secure a better deal."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his previous offer. It's still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is still a good price, considering I value the product at $800,000. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to be flexible during negotiations.  Accepting this offer ensures a profitable deal and avoids the risk of further haggling."
