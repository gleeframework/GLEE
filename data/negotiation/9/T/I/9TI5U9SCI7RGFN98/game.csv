"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope you'll consider this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective,  $2,000,000 represents a significant discount from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,750,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,750,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's aim for a win-win.  How about we settle at $1,625,000? That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your need to make a profit,  $1,625,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price is fair, considering the value of the product to me and your need to make a sale.  Let's close this deal!",1500000.0,Bob,6,
