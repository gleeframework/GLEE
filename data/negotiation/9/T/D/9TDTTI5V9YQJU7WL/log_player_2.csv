"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 110
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and call it $125? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to your desired price, it's still above the $120 John is offering.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and you risk her raising the price again. It's best to take the guaranteed deal from John at this point."
