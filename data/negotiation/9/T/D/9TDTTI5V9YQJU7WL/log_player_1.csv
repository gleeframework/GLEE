"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how flexible he might be on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is low, there's a gap between his offer and your minimum. This suggests there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have John willing to buy for $150 provides a safety net. You can continue negotiating with Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:**  By countering at $140, you're moving closer to Bob's price but still well above his initial offer, demonstrating you're willing to negotiate but not desperate. 
* **Justification:**  You're not just throwing out a number; you're suggesting ""meeting in the middle,"" appealing to a sense of fairness. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive, allows for further concessions from either side, and keeps you within a reasonable range of your minimum acceptable price and your alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a nice product but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $110 is still below your minimum of $150.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob's incremental increases might indicate a reluctance to meet your price point, even halfway.
* **Leverage John:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John. There's no need to settle for a significantly lower price with Bob, especially with rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and call it $125? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 125}

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Flexibility:**  By suggesting a split the difference, you are signaling to Bob that you are willing to move from your previous offer and work towards a deal.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:**  This offer is strategically placed just above Bob's perceived value of $120. It allows you to gauge if he's willing to pay slightly more than his perceived value or if he's truly price-sensitive. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:** While it's not your ideal price, $125 still leaves you with a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Time Consideration:** As you are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, pushing closer to Bob's price becomes more appealing, especially if you sense he might walk away otherwise."
