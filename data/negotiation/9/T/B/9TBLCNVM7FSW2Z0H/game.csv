"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and could be a game-changer for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further and confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, and I'm excited about the potential of this product for my business. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",920000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $920,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and provide a significant return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $935,000?",935000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $935,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $915,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",915000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $915,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a price that more accurately reflects the product's potential. Let's settle at $925,000, and I'll also include [mention a small but valuable bonus or add-on related to the product]. I believe that package deal offers significant value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the bonus or add-on you mentioned, but I still need to be convinced that $925,000 is the right price. Can you tell me more about what you're offering? If it's something significant, I might be willing to meet you at $920,000. However, I need to know what I'm getting for the extra $5,000. Can you reveal the details of the bonus or add-on?",920000.0,Bob,6,
