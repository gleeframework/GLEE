"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for you as you value it at $8,000, and it's a fair price considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my value, but I'm not sure I can go all the way to $9,500. Can we meet in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,000?  That's still a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a way to make this work!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $8,000 in my budget. How about we meet at $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're sticking to your number, but $8,750 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $8,900? It's a fair compromise and we can finalize this deal. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
