"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $7,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $7,250 is less than Bob's maximum of $8,000.
* **Significant savings:** Bob has already secured a $250 discount compared to John's price.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Alice has already moved halfway, making it less likely that she'll drop the price significantly further. 

While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer, potentially leading to a stalemate or a higher price later. Accepting the offer secures a decent deal and avoids potential risks."
