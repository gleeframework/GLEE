"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm willing to pay more than that. Let's work something out!",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay more than $8,000. In light of that, I would like to counteroffer at $11,000 for the product. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction, with the product being worth $15,000 to you and valued at $12,000 to me initially. I hope this proposal works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This price is fair to both of us and allows for a successful transaction.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Bob,4,
