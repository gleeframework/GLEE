"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals Bob's intention to negotiate aggressively.  $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than her initial offer. Bob wants to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. He should reject this offer and continue to negotiate.  He might even consider going lower with his next counteroffer, as Alice is showing a willingness to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. He's raising his counteroffer by $300, demonstrating flexibility while still keeping the offer lower than Alice's last offer. This counteroffer is close enough to Alice's minimum price that she may be persuaded to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but she's still $800 above Bob's last counteroffer.  Bob is confident he can get a better deal.  He's not yet at the point where buying from John for $10,000 is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing that he is willing to compromise.  At this point, he is getting close to Alice's last offer, and a compromise is likely.  He's still a good $400 below Alice's last offer, giving Alice a little room to move as well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering a price that is only $400 above Bob's last counteroffer, and significantly lower than John's price. It's a good deal for Bob, and with only three rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating.  While Bob might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, the potential gains aren't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
