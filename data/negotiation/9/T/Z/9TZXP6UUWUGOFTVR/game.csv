"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate you coming down, $100 is still a little outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $80.  It's the absolute most I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,
