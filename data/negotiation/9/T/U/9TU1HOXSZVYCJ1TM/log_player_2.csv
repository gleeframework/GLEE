It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good price.  While I'd still prefer to pay less, I'm not sure I can get her any lower. It's a good deal compared to John's price."
