"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the product's value to her. Rejecting this offer is the obvious choice, as it allows you to start negotiating a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I agree this product is valuable, your initial offer is quite high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from anchoring. By starting significantly lower than Alice's opening and your maximum, you create room for bargaining. 
* **Not Insulting:** While low, the offer is not ridiculously low, which could offend Alice and harm negotiations.
* **Leaves Room to Move:**  This offer gives you plenty of room to increase your offer gradually while staying well below your $800,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer has come down considerably, it's still above your maximum price and you have plenty of rounds to negotiate. By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about a lower price without being overly aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  I'm getting closer to a price where I can make this work.  How about we settle on $700,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump:** This counteroffer represents a $100,000 increase from your previous offer, showing Alice you are willing to move towards her price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** It keeps you below your $800,000 maximum but is getting close enough to potentially close the deal quickly if Alice is flexible.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer gauges Alice's willingness to accept a price below her stated minimum of $900,000.  Her response will give you valuable information about her negotiating style."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Over Limit:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **John is Safe:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. 
* **No Guarantee of Success:** There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, even with more negotiation. You could waste additional rounds and potentially end up with a worse outcome.

It's better to secure the product at a price you know you can afford, rather than risking exceeding your budget with Alice."
