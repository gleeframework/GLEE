"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product, given my budget.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, however.  How about we meet in the middle at $175?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $150.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",150.0,Bob,4,
