Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his range and adjust my next offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now lower than what John is willing to pay. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I can secure a higher price with John."
