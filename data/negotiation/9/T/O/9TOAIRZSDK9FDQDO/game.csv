"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the original price you mentioned was $15,000.",10000.0,Bob,4,
