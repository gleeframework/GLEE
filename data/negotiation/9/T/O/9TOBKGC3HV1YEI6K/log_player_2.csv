# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price.  Let's split the difference - how about $115?  This is a great deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.
