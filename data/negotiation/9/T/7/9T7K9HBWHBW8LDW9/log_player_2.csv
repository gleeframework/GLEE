"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally best to start with a counter-offer significantly lower than the asking price, but not insultingly so. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message aims to be polite while clearly stating that the initial price is too high.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting at $70, we're aiming to eventually land somewhere between our ideal price and Alice's minimum acceptable price ($80)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $95 is my initial asking price, I could come down to $85 for you.  I believe this product offers significant value, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is coming down, showing she's willing to negotiate. This is a positive sign.
* **Room for Improvement:**  There's still a gap between her offer ($85) and our target price (under $80).
* **Alternative Option:**  The option to buy from John for $100 provides a safety net, meaning we don't have to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I think that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're showing Alice we're willing to negotiate by moving closer to her price.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Tactic:** This common approach can feel like a win-win for both parties, making it more likely for Alice to agree.
* **Pressure:** By suggesting a specific price ($75) that's still below her last offer, we're applying subtle pressure for her to accept."
