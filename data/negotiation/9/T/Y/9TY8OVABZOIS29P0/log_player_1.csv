{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I can still potentially make a profit if he counteroffers closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $15,000, and it's also below the value of the product to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $11,000?  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is still below my desired price of $15,000, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offers and very close to the value of the product to him. I think it's a good compromise and worth accepting.  It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer, or selling to John for $15,000."
