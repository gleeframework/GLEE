"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again, and see if he's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to sell it at this point to avoid further negotiation. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and while Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, we're still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting his offer. With only four rounds remaining, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120 to ensure I get my minimum price."
