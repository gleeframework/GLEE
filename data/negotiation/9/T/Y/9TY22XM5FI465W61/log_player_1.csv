{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's priced at $120, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is:

* **Above your minimum:** $120 is more than your minimum of $80.
* **Below Bob's maximum:** $120 is less than Bob's perceived value of $150. 

This gives you a good starting point to potentially negotiate a price that benefits you both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $120. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum value for the product.  You can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $105 is still below your ideal price, it's a good compromise and above your minimum. You're also getting closer to Bob's perceived value, which makes a sale more likely. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and ensures a sale at a reasonable price."
