Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
