"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle? ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you'd like to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,200,000, which is my minimum, or $1,300,000, which is a slight discount from my initial offer?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,175,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're right about the product's value, Alice, and I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,200,000, which is my minimum price? If we can agree on this, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
