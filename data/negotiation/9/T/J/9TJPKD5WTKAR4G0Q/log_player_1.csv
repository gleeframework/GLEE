Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** I'm starting with a price of $125, which is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still potentially attractive compared to my guaranteed sale price to John ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down. If he counters, I have the flexibility to decrease the price slightly and still make a profit above my minimum.
* **Polite and Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the potential value to Bob without being overly pushy. 
 
**Goal:** The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring I don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
