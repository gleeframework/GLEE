Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered. Let me know what you think."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this time.  This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's final offer is far below your minimum acceptable price.  There's a significant gap between his valuation and yours, making further negotiation unlikely to result in a favorable outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures you receive your minimum desired price."
