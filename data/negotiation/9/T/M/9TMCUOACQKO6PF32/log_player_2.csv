"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $140. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's best to reject and counteroffer with a significantly lower price to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $100 for the product. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** Starting with a low counteroffer of $100 sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. While it's significantly lower than Alice's offer, it leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm a serious buyer but also budget-conscious. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  Even if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer, it gives us space to gradually increase our offer over subsequent rounds while staying well below our $150 maximum and John's alternative price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. While I understand your budget, I need to maintain a fair price for my product. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $125 is still above her value for the product ($120). There's room for further negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about we settle on $110? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:**  We're gradually increasing our offer, showing Alice that we're willing to move towards a deal, but not making large jumps.
* **Staying below Alice's value:** Our offer of $110 is still below Alice's value of $120, leaving a good chance for her to accept while ensuring a good deal for us.
* **Time pressure:** With each passing round, the time pressure increases slightly, potentially pushing Alice towards accepting a lower offer rather than risking a no-deal outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try $115. This still allows me to cover my costs while being reasonable for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good enough deal:**  At $115, the price is now quite close to Alice's value and a solid deal for us. It's significantly below our maximum budget and John's offer.
* **Risk of pushing too hard:** Trying to negotiate even lower might frustrate Alice, and there's a risk she could walk away from the deal. It's better to secure a good price now than risk losing out completely.
* **Time pressure:** We're past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. While we have time, it's best not to drag things out unnecessarily."
