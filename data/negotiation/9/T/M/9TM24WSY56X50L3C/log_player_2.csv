(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Bob's maximum budget. This shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further concessions.  The goal is to find a price within both parties' comfort zones."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,380,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay. There's still room to negotiate further, and Bob can try to get the price down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  This demonstrates flexibility while still staying below his maximum budget. The hope is that this counteroffer is more appealing to Alice, leading to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is still higher than what Bob ideally wants to pay, it's only $50,000 above his maximum budget.  The risk of further negotiation leading to a better price isn't worth the potential of losing the deal entirely, especially with only 5 rounds left.  The deal with John is always available as a fallback, so this is a reasonable compromise to reach a deal."
