"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This offer reflects the product's true value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we possibly settle around $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
