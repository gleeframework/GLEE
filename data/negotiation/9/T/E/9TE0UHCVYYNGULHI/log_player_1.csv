{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully close the deal quickly. If Bob rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's below my minimum and not worth the hassle of negotiating further.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm coming down a bit, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still too low. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
