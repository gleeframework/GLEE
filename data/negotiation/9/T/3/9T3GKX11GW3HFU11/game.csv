"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,800 as a final offer. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without losing too much profit.  What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,5,
