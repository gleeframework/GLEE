{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiation with Bob is not progressing quickly enough. While his offer is higher than John's, I'm concerned I won't be able to get a price that meets my minimum requirement within the remaining time.  Selling to John guarantees me the minimum I need, and it's the safest option at this point."
