{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is close to my limit, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. There's room for negotiation."

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about $90?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but slowly. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get her closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, how about $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not getting the price I want, Bob. I can meet you halfway between $95 and $105, so how about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating fairly and meeting me halfway. While I'd prefer to pay $95, $100 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It's not worth the risk of her increasing the price in later rounds."
