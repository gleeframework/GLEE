Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you.  While my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to offer it to you at a significant discount. Would a price of $1,300,000 interest you?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to offer a price significantly lower than his valuation to incentivize him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $1,500,000 (though John guarantees that amount).
* **Confidentiality:** Mentioning a ""confidential minimum"" creates the impression of a valuable deal and discourages Bob from lowballing. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice might need to adjust her offer."
