Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I know you value highly. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John, ensuring I don't go below that amount.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a potential $100,000 for Bob to still consider it a good deal while giving me a significant profit. 

This approach balances ambition with the security of a backup offer."
