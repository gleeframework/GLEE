"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to go up to $11,250? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
