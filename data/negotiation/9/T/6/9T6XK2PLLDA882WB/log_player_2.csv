"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. This is a fair price, and it gives you a chance to get a valuable product at a good price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Even though Alice's offer is ""fair"" from her perspective, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. John is offering the product for $12,000, which is Bob's maximum price point. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy for Bob."
