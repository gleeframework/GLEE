Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a justification for my price to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, making it a more collaborative process. 

By offering a price that is high but not unreasonable, I'm increasing the chances of a successful negotiation while still maximizing my profit. I'm also showing flexibility, which can be key in any negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  

* **Reasoning:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a higher price, and I'm confident that I can get it by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects the value of the product and also allows for some flexibility. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my initial price, but not by much.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm justifying the price based on the value of the product.
* **Openness:**  I'm still open to further negotiation.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests. I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and secure a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While it's still lower than my ideal price, accepting it secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially lowering the price or the possibility of Bob backing out altogether.  

* **Reasoning:** Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown in negotiations."
