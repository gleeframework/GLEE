"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is necessary.**  You have room to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving a significant amount of money.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 fully reflects the product's value to you. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000. This is very close to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within budget:** This counteroffer is still comfortably within your maximum budget of $1,500,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to let go of the product at $1,110,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,120,000. This is as close to your offer as I can get without sacrificing my own profit margins. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** At $1,120,000, it's still significantly less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiations have reached a stalemate.**  Alice has been consistently firm on her price, and you've reached a point where further negotiation may not yield a much better outcome.
* **Time is a factor.** You're nearing the end of your 10 rounds, and taking too long to make a decision could risk losing the product to another buyer or force you to buy from John at a higher price.

**This is a strategic decision. You're accepting a price that's still slightly above your ideal, but you're saving a considerable amount of money compared to John's price. You're also ensuring that you acquire the product without risking further delays or a potential collapse in the negotiations.**"
