"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one and call it $117.50?",117.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $117.50 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'd be willing to do $100, which is my final offer. It's a fair price, and I'm eager to make this purchase.",100.0,Bob,6,
