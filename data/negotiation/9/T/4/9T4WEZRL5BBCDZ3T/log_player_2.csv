"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and what you know John is offering. It makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) than my actual budget ($100). This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $80, I'm signaling that I'm interested but need a much better price. It encourages Alice to counter-offer and hopefully meet me closer to my budget. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $100. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $140 is better than her initial offer, but it's still significantly above your budget and what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move down suggests there's room for further negotiation.  
* **Leverage:** You still have the option of buying from John for $100, which gives you bargaining power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget in mind. I could go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the Offer, But Setting a Limit:**  You're showing Alice you're willing to negotiate by increasing your offer to $95.  However, you're also making it clear that this is your maximum price.
* **Anchoring:** By stating $95 as your ""absolute limit,"" you're psychologically anchoring the negotiation closer to your target range. This might make Alice more amenable to an offer between $95 and her current $140.
* **Time Constraint:**  You only have 10 rounds, so it's time to push a bit closer to your limit while still leaving yourself some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one and call it $117.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is getting closer, $117.50 is still over your $100 budget.
* **John's Offer:**  You know you can get the product for $100 from John. This price difference is significant enough to warrant another counteroffer.
* **Limited Rounds:** You're halfway through your negotiation rounds.  It's time to signal that you're serious about your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $117.50 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'd be willing to do $100, which is my final offer. It's a fair price, and I'm eager to make this purchase."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're now at your maximum budget. By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you're clearly communicating your limit to Alice. 
* **Justification:** You're offering a reasonable justification for your price by calling it ""fair."" 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning that you're ""eager to make this purchase"" subtly adds a sense of urgency, which might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Backup Plan:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can always buy from John for $100. You've maximized your potential savings while still trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
