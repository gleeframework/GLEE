Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $117.50 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'd be willing to do $100, which is my final offer. It's a fair price, and I'm eager to make this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated that $100 is his absolute final offer. While it might be tempting to try and negotiate a bit more, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. At this point, accepting John's offer of $150 is the most profitable decision."
