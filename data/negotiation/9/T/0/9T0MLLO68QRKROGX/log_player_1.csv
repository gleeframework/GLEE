"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate and gives me a strong starting point. I believe it's crucial to establish a high value early on to maximize potential profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still a good amount above Bob's last offer. I believe this price will be attractive enough to Bob to encourage him to accept, but it also keeps my profit margin within a range I'm comfortable with."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  We are getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a higher price.  With only a few rounds left, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to move closer to my desired range."

I'm countering with $1,275,000. This is a small step down from my previous offer, showing flexibility but still trying to maintain a good profit margin. I believe this price could be a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will be more willing to accept it with only a few rounds left."
