"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",130.0,Bob,4,
