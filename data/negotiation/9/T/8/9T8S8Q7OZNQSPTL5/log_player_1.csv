Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's a significant premium over John's offer.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and how much value he places on it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest but still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable level. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to close the deal without needing further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm comfortable with the $1,250,000.  While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, I'm wary of risking losing the deal completely. It's better to secure the sale now than risk another rejection and potentially having to settle for John's offer."
