Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset and I'm confident it will be worth even more to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the opportunity it represents for you. Let's close this deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $950,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a fair price and a good compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $937,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. 

Here's why:

* **Negotiations are stalled:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price.  It's unlikely they'll agree on a price in the remaining rounds.
* **John's offer is safe:** John's offer is guaranteed, and it's significantly lower than what Alice is offering. 
* **Time is running out:**  Bob only has 3 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks losing the opportunity to buy from John. 

By purchasing from John, Bob gets the product at a price that meets his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
