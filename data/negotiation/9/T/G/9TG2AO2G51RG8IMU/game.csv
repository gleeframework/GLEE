"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
