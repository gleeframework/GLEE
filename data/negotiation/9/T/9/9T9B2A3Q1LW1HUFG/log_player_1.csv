Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Could you consider reducing the price to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly what the product is worth to him, and thus, it is the best price I can get. Since I have a guaranteed alternative offer from John for the same amount, there is no incentive to risk further negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer secures the sale and guarantees the desired profit."
