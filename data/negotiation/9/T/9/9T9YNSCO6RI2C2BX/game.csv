"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me halfway again.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me halfway again.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,312,500?  This price is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away with a good deal. Let's close this deal and move on to bigger and better things.",1312500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a compromise from my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me halfway again.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
