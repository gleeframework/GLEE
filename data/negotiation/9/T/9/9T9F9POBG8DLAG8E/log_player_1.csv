{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob in my message, reminding him of the potential gains he stands to make. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further discussion and negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer.  If he accepts, I've secured a good deal.  If negotiations become difficult, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. Bob's willingness to offer $1,000,000 demonstrates he sees value in the product and is open to compromise.
* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit. Accepting his offer would mean leaving $200,000 on the table. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll need to weigh the potential of a better price against the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and appreciate you being open to negotiating. While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Value Justification:** I continue to emphasize the product's value while highlighting the mutual benefit of a successful deal.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by using phrases like ""What do you think?""  This keeps the communication open and prevents the negotiation from feeling like a hard stance.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to weigh the potential of further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still $150,000 below it.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, accepting this offer means leaving a significant amount of money on the table.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to increase the price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $950,000 and my minimum of $800,000.  I'll try to find a middle ground that both satisfies my financial goals and keeps the negotiation moving forward. However, I will carefully consider selling to John if I don't feel a better deal is achievable with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's split the difference one more time.  I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product. This price acknowledges your commitment to the deal and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's current offer ($950,000). This shows a continued willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal, ensuring both parties feel satisfied.
* **Final Offer:** I'm positioning this as a final offer to encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $800,000.  The risk of further negotiation and the potential of losing the deal entirely is high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $900,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Close Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still $100,000 below my ideal price. 
* **High Risk of Stalemate:**  I've already made several concessions and it seems like Bob might be unwilling to go higher.  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate and loss of the deal.
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of a protracted and potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I secure a profit. While I would have preferred a higher price, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is too high at this point."
