Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product for Bob. This sets a positive tone and encourages him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if I can secure a good price. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I won't drop my price too quickly. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for a price lower than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm rejecting his offer because I'm confident I can get a better price. 

**Strategy:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while also preserving my leverage.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed $100 sale with John, which allows me to be more assertive in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $95. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm also trying to be persuasive by emphasizing the fairness of the offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to consider his next counteroffer, but I'll be more likely to accept a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price that low.  I'm confident that I can get a better price by selling to John for $100, which is my guaranteed offer. 

**Strategy:**

Since I have a guaranteed sale with John at my minimum acceptable price, it doesn't make sense for me to continue negotiating with Bob at this point. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that I might end up with a lower price than what I'm guaranteed with John."
