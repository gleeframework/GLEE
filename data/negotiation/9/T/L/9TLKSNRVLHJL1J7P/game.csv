"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering what you're looking to get. Let's start with this and see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe in the value of this product, and I do too. However, I can't justify paying more than $9,000 right now. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
