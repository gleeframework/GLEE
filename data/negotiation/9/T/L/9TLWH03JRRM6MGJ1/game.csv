"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which is worth a great deal to me. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.  It's a significant opportunity, and I believe you'll find it extremely valuable. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This reflects the unique value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1100000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1050000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This gives us both a chance to make a deal, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
