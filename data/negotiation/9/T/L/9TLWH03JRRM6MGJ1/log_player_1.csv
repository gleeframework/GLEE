"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which is worth a great deal to me. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000.  It's a significant opportunity, and I believe you'll find it extremely valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a high price ($1,500,000) to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me, hoping to create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he rejects. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is still significantly above my minimum price, indicating a willingness to negotiate but establishing a strong starting point.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll likely make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial price, but still leaves room for agreement.
* If Bob's counteroffer is acceptable, I'll likely accept it to secure the deal.
* If the negotiation stalls or Bob becomes unreasonable, I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:**  While $1,000,000 is guaranteed, I'm aiming for a higher price if possible.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer but still open to negotiation. 
* I will continue to assess Bob's willingness to compromise and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If the negotiation continues to stall or Bob becomes unreasonable, I will consider selling to John to ensure a minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm again mentioning the unique value of the product to reinforce its worth.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Continue negotiation:** If Bob is willing to negotiate further, I'll aim to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Sell to John if necessary:** If Bob becomes unreasonable or the negotiation stalls, I'll consider selling to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is getting difficult:** It's becoming increasingly challenging to reach a deal with Bob. 
* **John is a viable alternative:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids further potential losses in negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum but still open to negotiation. 
* If Bob's next offer is still below my minimum, I will strongly consider selling to John.
* I will continue to assess Bob's willingness to compromise and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,100,000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This gives us both a chance to make a deal, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer before seriously considering John's deal. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that is the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing this as the last step I can take before potentially selling to John, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, I'll close the deal.
* **Consider John's offer:** If Bob rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000.  
* **Prepare for a potential final round:**  If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll need to carefully assess its viability and make a final decision."
