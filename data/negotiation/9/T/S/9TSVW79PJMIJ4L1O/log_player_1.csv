Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus you could tap into.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to secure a higher price.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's enticing to Bob (meaning it's below his $1,500,000 valuation) while still maximizing your gain. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at a price that reflects its worth: $1,395,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1395000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,395,000 is significantly below Bob's $1,500,000 valuation, giving him a strong incentive to accept. 
* **Creates Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) adds a time pressure that makes Bob less likely to stall or counter-offer.
* **Justified Value:**  By stating you've ""carefully considered"" the price, you imply it's not arbitrary and reinforces the idea of a fair deal.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,350,000) to give yourself some room to negotiate upwards.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly more generous price to foster goodwill.
