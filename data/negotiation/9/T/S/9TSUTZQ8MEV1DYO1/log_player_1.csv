{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate. However, it's also lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but selling to John is still my preferred option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives me a good price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
