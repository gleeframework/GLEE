"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" reinforces the value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If negotiations stall, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can convince him to pay a higher price.
* **Strategic Advantage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control and potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send Bob a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still within a range where a deal is possible.
* **Monitoring Progress:** I'll carefully assess Bob's willingness to negotiate and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Selling to John:** If negotiations stall or become unfruitful, I will sell to John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $80 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $90 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's make this happen!"" subtly adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider my offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Response:**  I will carefully monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to consider my next move.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to counter again, but I'll carefully assess his counteroffers and my own remaining rounds. 
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations seem futile, I will sell to John to ensure I receive at least my minimum price."
