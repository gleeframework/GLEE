"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice! Thank you for offering this product. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit out of your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate the movement. How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair price to me.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",85.0,Alice,5,
