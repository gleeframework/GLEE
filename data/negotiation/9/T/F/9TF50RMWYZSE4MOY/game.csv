"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,400,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the return on investment you can expect. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer reflects the product's exceptional value while acknowledging your interest.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your interest and am motivated to find a solution that works for both of us.  To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for this unique product. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair reflection of its value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,580,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1580000.0,Bob,6,
