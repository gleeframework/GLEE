I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is based on the fact that I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I want to maximize my profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a chance that he might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I still have John who will buy for $800,000, so there's no downside to this initial offer."
