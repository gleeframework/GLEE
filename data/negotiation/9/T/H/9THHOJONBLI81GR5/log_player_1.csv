{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I am serious about selling to him, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, but it's good to see he's willing to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
