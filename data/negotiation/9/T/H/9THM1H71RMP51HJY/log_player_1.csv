Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value beyond that. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still thinking $1,800,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems anchored at $1,800,000. While it's a good profit, we still have time to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. I'll try to nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be sure this deal makes sense for both of us. How about we settle on $1,900,000? This reflects my willingness to be flexible while acknowledging the value of the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. How about $1,850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has finally moved from his $1,800,000 anchor. While it's not the $2,000,000 I aimed for, $1,850,000 is a strong profit, and continuing to negotiate might risk him lowering his offer or sticking stubbornly to $1,800,000. It's time to close the deal."
