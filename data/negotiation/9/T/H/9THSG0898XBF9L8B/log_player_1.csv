Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I still cannot meet you at $140. My budget is firmly set at $80. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly anchored at $80 and unwilling to budge. It's not worth wasting further rounds when you have a guaranteed offer for $150 from John."
