"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $85. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",85.0,Alice,5,
