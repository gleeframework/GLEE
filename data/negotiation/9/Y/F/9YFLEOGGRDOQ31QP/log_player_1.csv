Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,100,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial discount from John's offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By presenting it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" the message subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between securing the highest possible price and avoiding the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, leading to a sale at the base price to John."
