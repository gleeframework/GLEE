"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a proposal. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is considerably below what I believe the product is worth and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find some middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000?  This reflects a willingness to move towards your range, but also acknowledges the real value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to find middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,900,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
