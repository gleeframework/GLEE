"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential of what's on offer. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) provides room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's likely too high for him, it can influence his perception of what's a ""reasonable"" price during the negotiation.
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer is as much about gathering information as it is about closing the deal. Bob's reaction will give me insights into his negotiating style and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than his stated perceived value of $800,000. This indicates he's willing to pay a premium for the product, and there's room for negotiation. 
* **Below My Minimum:** Accepting $1,200,000 would be a significant loss compared to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 or selling to John.
* **Early Stage:**  It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter and try to steer the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a proposal. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is considerably below what I believe the product is worth and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find some middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000?  This reflects a willingness to move towards your range, but also acknowledges the real value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** My counteroffer drops by $300,000, signaling to Bob that I'm flexible and want to make a deal. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  The $1,900,000 price keeps me well above my absolute floor of $1,500,000 (and John's standing offer).
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility.  Will he continue to move significantly upward, or is he more firmly anchored around the $1,200,000 mark?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to find middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,900,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches My Minimum and John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 aligns perfectly with both my lowest acceptable price and John's standing offer.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating strong interest in the product. Accepting now capitalizes on this momentum and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling the negotiation.
* **Time Value of Money:** While I might be able to push Bob slightly higher in further rounds, the potential gain is likely outweighed by the benefits of closing the deal now â€“ securing the $1,500,000 and moving forward."
