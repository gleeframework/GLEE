Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my asking price is $19,000, I'm open to hearing your thoughts on a fair price."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is crafted to be open-ended, inviting Bob to counter-offer.  This will help you understand how interested he is and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you're not losing out.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Remember, Bob only values the product at $8,000. You'll need to convince him of its additional value to justify a price significantly higher. 
* **Relationship:** Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If you drive a hard bargain and he feels cheated, it could damage future interactions."
