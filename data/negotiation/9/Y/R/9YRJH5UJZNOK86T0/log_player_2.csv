"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and features, it's worth more than $100 to us. Considering its value, we're offering it to you for $120. This is a special offer considering the high demand and limited stock. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm only willing to pay $90 at this time.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to secure the product for as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $90 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of possibility, given that the product is worth $100 to Bob.  This counteroffer gives Alice room to counter while still allowing Bob to potentially secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. We propose an offer of $105 for our product. We hope this aligns better with both our expectations and allows you to enjoy the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his $100 limit. Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $100, he shouldn't accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still only comfortable offering $95.  This is my final offer, as I can get the same product from another seller for $100. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for a lower price but is willing to pay $95, which is a reasonable compromise. He is making it clear that this is his final offer, adding pressure to Alice to accept.  The mention of the alternative seller reinforces Bob's position and emphasizes the urgency for Alice to close the deal."
