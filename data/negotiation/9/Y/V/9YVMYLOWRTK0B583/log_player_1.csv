Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999.  It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above her own minimum ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a price just below her guaranteed sale price with John, she creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario,  a slightly inflated price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a slightly higher price."
