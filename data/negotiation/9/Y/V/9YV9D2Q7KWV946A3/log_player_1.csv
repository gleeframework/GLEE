Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to let it go for $110."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $120, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $110 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $10 discount compared to its value to him, and I make a $30 profit, which is more than I would make selling to John. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning listing the product publicly subtly implies scarcity and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly."
