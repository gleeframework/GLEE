Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product.  While $1100000 is a tempting offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price to reflect the true value and potential of the product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1125000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential for significant returns.  I hope we can reach an agreement soon.
