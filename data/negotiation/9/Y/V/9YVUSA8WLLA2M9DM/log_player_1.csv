Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below your minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your absolute minimum allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose out."
