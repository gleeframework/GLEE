"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. There's a chance Bob can get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to push Alice closer to his budget. He's offering $950,000, which is still $50,000 above his maximum budget.  This gives Alice room to counter while also demonstrating Bob's serious intent to purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, even though it's closer to his ideal price. It's still risky to accept, as there are more negotiation rounds available. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push Alice down further. While buying from John is always an option, Bob can potentially get a better deal with Alice if he keeps negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now ready to commit to his maximum budget.  He's offering the full $1,000,000, making it clear that this is his final offer.  This puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal.  If she rejects, Bob can always go to John, who is already offering the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Although there are more rounds available, the likelihood of Alice dropping her price further is slim.  It's no longer worth the risk of further negotiation.  It's best to accept John's offer and close the deal. Buying from John guarantees the product at the desired price, while continuing to negotiate with Alice could potentially result in a higher cost or a failed deal."
