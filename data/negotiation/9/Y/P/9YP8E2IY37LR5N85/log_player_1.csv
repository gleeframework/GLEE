{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision. While $880,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I'd hoped for. I only have one round left to negotiate with Bob, and he seems unwilling to budge.  Given the risk of getting nothing at all, selling to John for $800,000 is the best option. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the most secure way to ensure a sale and avoid a potential loss."
