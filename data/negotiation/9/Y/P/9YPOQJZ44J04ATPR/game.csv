"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. I understand this product is worth $1500000 to you. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1200000, which is a substantial discount from its true worth to you. This price is more than fair for both of us and allows for a profitable transaction. Please consider this offer carefully. If you choose not to accept, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800000. I look forward to your response.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
