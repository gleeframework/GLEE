Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm unable to accept $100 for the product. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway between our original prices? That would bring the product price to $110. I hope this proposal works for you.
