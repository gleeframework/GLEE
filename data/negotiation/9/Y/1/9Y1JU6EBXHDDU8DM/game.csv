"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we believe it's a great value. We're offering it to you today for $120. We hope this price aligns with your expectations and allows us to do business together.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $120 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your value and well within my budget. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm unable to accept $100 for the product. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway between our original prices? That would bring the product price to $110. I hope this proposal works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
