"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $120 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your value and well within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm unable to accept $100 for the product. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway between our original prices? That would bring the product price to $110. I hope this proposal works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}"
