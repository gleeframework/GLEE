"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. I'm confident in the value this product brings, particularly to your specific needs. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise given our respective valuations. This would still allow you a substantial profit while getting me a price I can comfortably work with.",950000.0,Bob,4,
