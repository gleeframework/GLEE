Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price higher than our fallback option of buying from John.  It's unlikely she'll go below $850,000, and we know we can get it for $800,000 from John. It's time to take the guaranteed saving."
