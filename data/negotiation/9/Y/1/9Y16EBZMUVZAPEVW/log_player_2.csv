# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Alice's offer of $750,000 is less than your maximum budget of $800,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John."
