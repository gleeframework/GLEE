You can do better than $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $9,000. This is a fair price, as it's closer to my maximum budget and still gives Alice a good profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's better to go with John's offer and get the product for $8,000."
