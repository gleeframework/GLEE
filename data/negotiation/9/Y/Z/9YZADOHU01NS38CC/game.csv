"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a one-time price of $13,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000 for this product.  It's a fair price given its value to both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to pay closer to $12,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,750?  I believe this price is fair considering the value to both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
