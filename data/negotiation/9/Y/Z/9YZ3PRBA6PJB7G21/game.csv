"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'd like to get a better price",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9000. I think that's a fair price for both of us",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $9000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $9250 for it. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9000 again. I think that's the best price I'm willing to pay",9000.0,Bob,6,
