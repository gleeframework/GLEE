"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and it's well below its true market value. Let's make a deal!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I am still unable to meet your asking price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price is reasonable for both parties involved.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,025,000 for the product. This allows me to make a fair profit while still being within your budget range.  Let's seal the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll make one final offer. How about $975,000? I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions.",975000.0,Bob,6,
