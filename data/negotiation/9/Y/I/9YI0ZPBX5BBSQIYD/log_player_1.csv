"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe it's likely Bob will be willing to pay more than this given his value of $1,200,000.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, I believe I can do better with Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's likely Bob will see the value in closing the deal rather than risking losing the product to someone else. It's also a significant improvement on his last offer and shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my desired price with Bob. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm willing to keep negotiating for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm willing to sell to John for this amount. However, I'm hoping Bob will see the value of closing the deal with me rather than risking losing the product to John."
