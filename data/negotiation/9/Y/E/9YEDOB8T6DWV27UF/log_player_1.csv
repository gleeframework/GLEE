Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob might accept it, or he might counter offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I also have John as a backup buyer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm still interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm happy to negotiate, Bob's offer of $85 is still far below my minimum price of $150.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with him, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
