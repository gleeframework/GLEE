"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I still have 9 rounds to work with."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but  $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  That feels like a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $750,000 is too low for me at this point, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I have a few more rounds to try and get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $750,000 is a significant offer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $850,000.  This is the lowest I can go at this point, but I truly believe this product is worth it to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I want to see if I can get him to go higher in the next couple of rounds.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have a few rounds left with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $775,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset for your business.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}
