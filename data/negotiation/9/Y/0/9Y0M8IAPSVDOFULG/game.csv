"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm really aiming for a price closer to $100. How about $105? I think that's a fair compromise.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $110? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great value for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little out of my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $107.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my goal.",107.5,Bob,4,
