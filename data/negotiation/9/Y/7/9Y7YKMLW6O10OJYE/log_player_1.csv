Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,190,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with $1,190,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob attempts to counter-offer) while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about your deal with John. If Bob knew about John, he would have no incentive to offer more than $1,200,000."
