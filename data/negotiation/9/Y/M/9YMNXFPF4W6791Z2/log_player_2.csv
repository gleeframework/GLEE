"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product valued at $1,000,000 for a slightly reduced amount. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This is still a significant profit for you, and it aligns better with my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to counter with an offer of $900,000 for the product. This remains a substantial profit for me while considering your budget constraints. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible. While $900,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still a chance to get closer to his target of $850,000. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try again with a counteroffer."
