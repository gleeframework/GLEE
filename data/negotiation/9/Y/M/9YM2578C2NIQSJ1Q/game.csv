"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can see that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate that.  I'm still a bit stretched at $10,500.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy with a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is the last time I'll be able to make a concession, so I hope we can finalize the deal here.",11000.0,Alice,5,
