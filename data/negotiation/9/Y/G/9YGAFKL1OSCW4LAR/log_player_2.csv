"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is offering $900,000. This is a good start, but you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product brings, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is closer to your budget, you can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and see if you can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $862,500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $862,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $870,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiation with Alice is getting close to your budget, but it's not moving fast enough. You've already gone through 5 rounds and Alice is still above your target price of $800,000. It's likely that continuing to negotiate with Alice will take too long, potentially exceeding your 10 rounds. It's time to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $800,000."
