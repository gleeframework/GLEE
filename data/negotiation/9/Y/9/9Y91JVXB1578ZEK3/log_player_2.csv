"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  I understand it's worth that amount to you, so I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know if you're interested, and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Since Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly what it's worth to you, there's no advantage to buying from her. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Therefore, it's best to buy from John."
