Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth a guaranteed $1,500,000 to Alice (from John), she has leverage to start the negotiation significantly higher. This leaves room for potential negotiation while ensuring a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value without explicitly revealing Alice's minimum acceptable price. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" signal to Bob that Alice is open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective as a potential buyer."
