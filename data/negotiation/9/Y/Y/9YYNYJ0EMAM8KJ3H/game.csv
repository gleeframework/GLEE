"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is still a good price for the product, considering its value to you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
