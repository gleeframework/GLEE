"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, knowing he'll likely counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to sway him towards a higher price. 
* **Setting the Stage:** This initial offer establishes a strong starting point and positions me as the seller in control."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me.  I'm willing to offer $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is far off, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Exploring Potential:**  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that's mutually beneficial. I still have nine rounds to try to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $1,750,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm adjusting my price downward but staying well above Bob's offer.  This signals a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
* **Fairness and Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value proposition, reminding Bob that the product is worth significantly more than his initial offer.
* **Room for Compromise:** My counteroffer leaves some room for future negotiation, making it more likely that we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $700,000?  That's a significant amount and demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  Bob's message indicates he's willing to negotiate further and recognizes the value of the product.  
* **Exploring Better Options:**  I'm going to counteroffer again to try and reach a price that's closer to my expectations. I still have six rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, but it's also a fair price considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm reducing my price again, showing a willingness to meet halfway, but still maintaining a price significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Compromise and Value:** I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making and the value Bob will receive, hoping to sway him.
* **Time Pressure:** We're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations. This counteroffer might push Bob to consider a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. I can do $800,000. That's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair offer considering John is offering the same product at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  While $800,000 is Bob's maximum budget, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're at the halfway point of the negotiations, and there's a good chance we won't reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price. Accepting Bob's offer would mean taking a significant loss.

**It's more advantageous to secure the sale with John for $1,500,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to come up to my minimum acceptable price.**"
