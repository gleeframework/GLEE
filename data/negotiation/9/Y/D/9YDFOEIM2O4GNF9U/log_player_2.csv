"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. I'm confident this product will be a huge asset to you, offering significant value.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which still allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm confident it can significantly impact your business positively. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant offer considering my initial budget. This represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
