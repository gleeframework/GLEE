"Thanks for countering, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $125 still feels a bit high.  Could you do $110?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $110 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $115 is my final offer. If you're interested, let's close this deal. ",115.0,Alice,5,
