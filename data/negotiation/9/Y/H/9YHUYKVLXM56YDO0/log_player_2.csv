{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's worth $10,000 to you, and she's starting at $12,000.  There's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on $9,500.  I'm sure we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer you a price of $10,800, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still holding out for a lower price. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get it for $10,000 or a little above.  Remember, I can always buy from John for $10,000 if this negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $10,200 to make it worth my while. I can offer you a price of $10,500. Let's see if we can shake hands on this one. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is only $500 more than what I'm willing to pay for the product from John.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance she might not budge further, and I could end up buying it for $10,000 from John anyway."
