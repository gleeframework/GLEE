"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on $9,500.  I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer you a price of $10,800, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $10,200 to make it worth my while. I can offer you a price of $10,500. Let's see if we can shake hands on this one.",10500.0,Alice,7,
