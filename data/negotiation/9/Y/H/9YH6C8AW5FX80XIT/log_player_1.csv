"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This initial offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below what I consider a fair price.  There are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a value closer to my desired range.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and will encourage Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer is still not high enough.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, and I believe I can still get a better deal with more rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm making a small compromise, but maintaining a firm stance to achieve a price that's closer to my desired outcome.  I believe this counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, there are still a few rounds left.  I believe there's still room to secure a higher price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm making a final concession, bringing my price down to $1,350,000.  This offer is still significantly higher than what I would get from John, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. With fewer rounds remaining, I believe this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high.  Although his offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not where I want it to be.  Selling to John will guarantee me a decent profit and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation that may not result in a higher offer from Bob."
