"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my usual asking price and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
