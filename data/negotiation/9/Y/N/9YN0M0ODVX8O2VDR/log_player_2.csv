"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum budget and still a profit for Alice.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and having to buy from John at a higher price."
