"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price closer to his target.  $8,500 is still a good deal for Alice, allowing for a potential profit, and it gives Bob room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better.  Rejecting and counteroffering keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer but still below his target.  This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while keeping the pressure on Alice to compromise.  The price also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed in the next rounds."
