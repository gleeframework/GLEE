"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
