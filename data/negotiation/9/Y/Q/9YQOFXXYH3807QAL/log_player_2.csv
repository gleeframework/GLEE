Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly less than its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I value your interest, I need to be fair to myself. Let's make this work: $1,100,000 and we have a deal.  This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my desire to close this deal with you.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer, but it's still above my budget. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also starting to feel like it might be a better idea to buy from John. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet and will make one more counteroffer."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my absolute final offer. It's a significant discount and a fair deal considering the value this product brings.  Let me know your decision.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still over my budget. While I've been willing to negotiate, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  I've had six rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to get Alice below $1 million, and I only have four rounds left. With John offering a firm $800,000, it's time to cut my losses and buy from him."
