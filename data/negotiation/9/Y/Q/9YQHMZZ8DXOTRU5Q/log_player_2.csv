You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Bob should reject the offer.  $13,000 is over his budget, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $11,500 is still a bit above his ideal price, it's within his budget and a better deal than buying from John.  Further negotiation might get him a slightly lower price, but there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and rejecting future offers.  It's a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
