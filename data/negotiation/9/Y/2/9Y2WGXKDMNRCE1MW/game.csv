"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a premium price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is justified. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
