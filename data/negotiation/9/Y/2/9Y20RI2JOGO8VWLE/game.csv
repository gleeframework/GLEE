"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This gives us both a little bit of what we want. Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? This is the closest I can go to your previous offer, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price.",1012500.0,Bob,4,
