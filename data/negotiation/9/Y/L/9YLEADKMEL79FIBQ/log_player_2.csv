"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $150, and I'm offering it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to earn more than I would by selling it to someone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money and achieves your goal of acquiring the product."
