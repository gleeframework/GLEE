{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This is a starting point higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and expresses a willingness to negotiate. This helps keep Bob engaged and open to a deal.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I hope to secure a price closer to my desired $150 minimum.  If Bob rejects, we can engage in a back-and-forth until we reach a mutually agreeable price or I can move on to John, my backup buyer, to secure my $150 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my bargaining position:**  A quick acceptance would signal weakness and potentially lead to a less favorable outcome in the negotiation.
* **Continue negotiating:** I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point. This allows me to explore if a mutually agreeable price can be reached.
* **Preserve the option to sell to John:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I still have the option to secure my minimum price by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant step towards your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $140:** This price is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **The message:**  It's friendly and acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while highlighting the value of the product. It also suggests that this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Bridge the gap:** It moves closer to Bob's offer, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Maintain a firm position:** It's still above my minimum, preventing me from accepting an offer that's too low.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** It leaves room for more back-and-forth, allowing us to explore if a truly mutually agreeable price can be found."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I am open to negotiation, I am not willing to sell for such a low price, as it wouldn't cover my cost and wouldn't be worth my time.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I can:

* **Guarantee my minimum profit:** John is offering my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I meet my financial goal.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  This saves time and effort that could be spent on a negotiation that might not lead to a favorable outcome.

I am confident that selling to John is the most logical and profitable choice in this situation."
