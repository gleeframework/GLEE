"I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate the offer, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this work. Let's find a compromise that's fair to both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $130 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $135? This would be a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? I'm really interested in the product and want to find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,6,
