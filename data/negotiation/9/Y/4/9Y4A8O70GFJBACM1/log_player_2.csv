Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $97.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that makes sense for you.  She's rejected your offer of $90, and her counteroffers are creeping back up. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $120. While it's not ideal, it's better than getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Alice and potentially paying even more."
