Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **50% Markup:** Starting at $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from Bob's perceived value. While this is a significant increase, it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, but avoids being overly specific about those factors to maintain flexibility in negotiations.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, you might adjust your initial offer slightly lower.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important for future potential deals.  Your tone should be confident but respectful."
