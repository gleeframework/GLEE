"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000. This price gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be extremely valuable. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
