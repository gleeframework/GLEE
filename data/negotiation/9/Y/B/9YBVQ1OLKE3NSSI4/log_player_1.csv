Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's less than the product's value to Bob:** This gives Bob incentive to accept the offer.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

By starting at $1,200,000, you can potentially achieve a very good outcome while still leaving room for negotiation. Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its true value while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob and your initial offer.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows you to potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000. This price gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be extremely valuable. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but maintain value:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by coming down from the initial $1,200,000 but still reflects a significant value for the product.
* **Reinforce value to Bob:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him understand the potential loss if he rejects the offer.
* **Positive framing:** Using phrases like ""good deal"" and ""work together"" promotes a collaborative tone and helps avoid a stalemate. 

By maintaining a firm but reasonable stance, this counteroffer increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation while still achieving a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your position, I still believe we can find common ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. This price respects the value you see in it while remaining within my budget. I hope we can move forward with this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is still below your ideal price, it's only $50,000 lower than your last counteroffer.  It's also significantly higher than selling to John. Given Bob's insistence on this price, it's likely that further negotiation will result in a similar price or even lower.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit that's still within a reasonable range."
