"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still not satisfied with the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. This is the minimum price I need to make a profit, and I think it's still a great deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you the product for $8,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid we're just too far apart.  I could meet you halfway at $8,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",8000.0,Bob,6,
