# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget, so it's worth exploring if I can negotiate a better price. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get her down closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down in price, but it's still higher than I'd like. I'll reject her offer and try to get her closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to go a bit higher than $750,000, but I still have room to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $800000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $815,000, which is very close to my counteroffer of $800,000.  While I could try to push for a lower price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  I'm comfortable with this price, so I'll accept and move forward with the purchase."
