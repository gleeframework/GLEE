"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $800000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",815000.0,Alice,5,
