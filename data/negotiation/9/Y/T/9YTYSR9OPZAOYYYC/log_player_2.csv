Let's discuss how we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a fantastic deal! Alice is offering the product for significantly less than it's worth to her, and well below your maximum budget. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price by negotiating further."
