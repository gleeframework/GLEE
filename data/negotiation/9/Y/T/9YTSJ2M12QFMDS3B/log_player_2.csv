Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $120 to me. Alice's offer of $150 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $110. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within my budget. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still a bit too high. While it's closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to save a few dollars.  I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a better price.  I'm hoping this will be a compromise point that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $118 is very close to my maximum budget. I'm comfortable accepting this offer as it's only a few dollars over my preferred price. Buying from John would cost me the same amount, and this deal is a little less risky as I am not sure what the price will be for the remaining rounds."
