"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this fantastic product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $120 is tempting, it's important to stick to my bottom line. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, and John is already offering that price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better result, and I risk losing John's offer if I delay.
