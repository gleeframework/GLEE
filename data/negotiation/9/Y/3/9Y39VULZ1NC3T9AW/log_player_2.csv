"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We know the product is worth less to her than her offer, leaving room for negotiation.  We can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We want to start with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. By offering $8,500, we signal that we're serious about buying but not willing to pay her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $9,250?  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's split the difference. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit above her value for the product. We need to push her further down without being unreasonable. Let's counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,800?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8800
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're inching closer. By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we create a sense of compromise while still pushing for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $9,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and allows us to close this negotiation. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $9,000 is tempting, we're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  Alice is clearly willing to move on price, so we need to see if we can push her a bit further down before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle this right now at $8,900? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 8900
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are now past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. It's time to apply a bit more pressure while still showing willingness to compromise. By presenting this as our ""final offer"" we signal to Alice that we're serious and won't move much further. This might be enough to get her to accept a price closer to our target."
