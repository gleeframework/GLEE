"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation. Alice's first offer is way too high. We have plenty of room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price well below John's $8,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a point where it's more advantageous to buy from her than John.  Let's see if we can get her closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on a price of $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

We're pushing a bit closer to our ideal price while still leaving room for some back-and-forth.  This offer shows Alice we're serious about buying but still want a competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I still need to make a decent profit. I can do $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting close, but we can still try to push Alice a little further. She's now only $500 above John's price. Let's see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice!  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 8250
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference here to show Alice we're serious about closing the deal but not budging much further. This offer keeps us below John's price while giving Alice a slight edge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's the lowest price I can accept without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our bottom line. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going to John, as they both offer the same price."
