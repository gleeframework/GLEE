I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."

I'm offering a price that's just above Bob's last offer.  This shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm also confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum."
