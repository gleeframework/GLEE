"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $140, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150 maximum.
* Alice is offering it for $140.
* John is offering it for $150.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum value. You can get the product for your maximum price from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
