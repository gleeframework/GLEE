Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000 to you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
