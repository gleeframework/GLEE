"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is higher than my maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $17,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price, given my budget and the potential of the product."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $18500. This is a significant price reduction and still reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $18,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired maximum.  I'll try one more counteroffer before exploring John's option."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to secure this product for $17,500. It's a fair price considering both our positions. Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 17500}
