Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point as it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not excessively so. I want to see if I can get a good deal, but I'm also aware that Bob might reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product is worth $100 to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as I'm not willing to go lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. While Bob's offer of $92 is slightly better than my previous counteroffer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I'm confident I can get a better deal with John."
