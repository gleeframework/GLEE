"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know is of great value to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking $1,100,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
