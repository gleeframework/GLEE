"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $18000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $22000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19500, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer it to you for $20500. This is a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",20500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $20500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19000, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",19000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I'm still not seeing the price I was hoping for. I can offer it to you for $20000, but I have to say that I'm getting a bit anxious to close the deal. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating.",20000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting anxious to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $19000 and $20000, which would be $19500. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",19500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've been patient so far, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet on the price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $19800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",19800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make one final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $19200, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000.",19200.0,Bob,10,
