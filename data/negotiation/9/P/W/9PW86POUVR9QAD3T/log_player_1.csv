"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value for the product. I have 9 rounds left to try and get a better deal from Bob, or I can always sell to John for my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,300,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,250,000? This is a fair middle ground, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to a deal, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob, but if I don't see a significant improvement in the next few rounds, I'll sell to John and guarantee myself a good return."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost there! I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,260,000?  This is a small step towards my budget, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While he's getting closer, it's not quite at the price point I'm looking for. We have 4 rounds left, and I'm hoping we can get to a point where we can both agree on a price. If it doesn't happen, I'll sell to John."
