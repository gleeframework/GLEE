"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,300,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,250,000? This is a fair middle ground, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
