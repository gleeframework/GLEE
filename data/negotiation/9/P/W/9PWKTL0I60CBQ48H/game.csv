"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1050000? This price still represents a significant value for you, and it's a good starting point for us to continue our negotiations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1025000? This price is still a good compromise for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
