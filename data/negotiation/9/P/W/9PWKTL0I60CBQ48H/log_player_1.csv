{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It also leaves room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000.
* **The message** is friendly and  highlights the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Remember:** This is just the first offer. I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, or to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While he's willing to pay a premium, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile for me.

* **Rejecting the offer:**  I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price. 
* **Moving to the next round:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Keeping John as an option:** I still have the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This price still represents a significant value for you, and it's a good starting point for us to continue our negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $1,050,000:** This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Emphasize value:** The message reinforces the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'll get.
* **Open to negotiations:** I  express willingness to continue negotiations, signaling that I'm flexible and want to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1025000? This price is still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's a good compromise and a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product to him.

* **Accepting the offer:** This is the best outcome for me at this point, as I'm able to secure a price that's only slightly lower than my initial offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** While I could try to push for a higher price, it's likely that Bob will be unwilling to go higher, and I might end up losing the sale.
* **Taking advantage of the deal:**  $1,025,000 is a good price considering John is only offering $1,000,000."
