"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000 is not an option, but I can meet you halfway at $1100000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm disappointed that we couldn't meet at $1050000, but I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000, but I need to make a decision soon. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
