{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's priced at $1,200,000, reflecting its significant worth and potential benefits to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1500000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and can always choose to sell to John for $800,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a good price, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a good compromise considering the value of this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value I'll get from it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still holding out for a better deal. With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to see if Bob will come up to a more favorable price. I'm not willing to sell to John at this point, as $1,050,000 is a more appealing offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I still need to get a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $1,075,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1080000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,080,000 is a good price, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of getting a better offer is diminishing. It's also much better than selling to John for $800,000."
