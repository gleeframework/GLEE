"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$800,000 is a good price, but it's still early in the negotiation.  There's a good chance I can get it lower by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 25% lower than Alice's initial offer. This signals my serious intent to purchase the product but also shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It's important to note that this is a significant drop, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to land somewhere in the middle ground over the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but I'm still confident I can get a better price.  There's still a significant gap between our positions, and I want to see if I can push her further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a firm stance on getting a good deal.  The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us and move closer to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is getting closer to my desired price range. While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal altogether or ending up with a worse price from John is increasing.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product, especially since I have a limited number of rounds."
