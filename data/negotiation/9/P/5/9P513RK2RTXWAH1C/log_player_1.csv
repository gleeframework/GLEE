{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for potential counteroffers.  It's important to leave some space for negotiation, as a hardball tactic might lead to Bob walking away.  By starting high and providing a clear message about the value to Bob, this sets the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum threshold of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting his offer allows you to explore options for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? That way, we both walk away with a win."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? That way, I can still get a good deal, and you'll get a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is closer to your minimum, there's still potential to get closer to your desired $900,000. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable going any lower than $890,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen, I'm ready to close."", ""product_price"": 890000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers are unlikely to yield a price above your minimum threshold of $800,000.  Selling to John at this point ensures a guaranteed profit, and prevents the risk of further negotiation rounds that could potentially lead to a lower price."
