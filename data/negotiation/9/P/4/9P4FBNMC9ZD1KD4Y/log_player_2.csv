"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $90
* **John's price:** $100

You can get the product for $10 less from John, making it the better option even though it's not the absolute lowest price."
