"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,125? That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a great deal.",11125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $10,900? That's a significant move on my end, and I'm hoping we can close the deal there.",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,900 is still a little too low for me.  Given your initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $11,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,5,
