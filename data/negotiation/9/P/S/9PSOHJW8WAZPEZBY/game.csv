"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",8250.0,Bob,4,
