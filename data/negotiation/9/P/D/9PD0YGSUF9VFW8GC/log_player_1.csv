Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This gives me a good margin while also being a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get at least $80 from John, so I have room to be flexible if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm countering with $85. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise, but if he rejects again, I'll be ready to sell to John."
