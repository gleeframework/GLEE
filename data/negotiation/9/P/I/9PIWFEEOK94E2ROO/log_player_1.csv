Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a price point that:
    * Offers Bob a significant saving compared to his perceived value ($12,000).
    * Earns me a profit that's still very close to my guaranteed sale price.
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and suggests that the price is open to discussion, potentially leading to a quick and agreeable sale."
