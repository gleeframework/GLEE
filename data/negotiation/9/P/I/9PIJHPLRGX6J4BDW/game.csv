"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further if needed, but I'd like to start with this counteroffer.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still slightly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
