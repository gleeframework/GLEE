Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage to start the negotiation higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $15,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to go lower or stick closer to your minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately turned off by the price, you haven't lost anything as you have John as a backup. If he's interested, you have room to negotiate a potentially higher sale price."
