"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $975,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. It's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to move on the price.  To be honest, I have another offer I need to consider.  If you're able to come down to $950,000, I'm ready to close the deal today. ",950000.0,Bob,6,
