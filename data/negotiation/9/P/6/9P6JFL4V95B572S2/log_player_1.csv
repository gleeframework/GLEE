{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up in price. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer again or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest, but I can't go that low. How about $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts. I would like to offer $95 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'll counteroffer Bob one more time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects again, I'll move on to John to secure the guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
