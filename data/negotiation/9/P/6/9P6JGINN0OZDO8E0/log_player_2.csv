"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $1,100,000.  You'll counteroffer Alice and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. It's important to show that you're serious about saving money, but also leave some room for negotiation. $950,000 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's closer to her value of $1,200,000 than John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John, as you're guaranteed to save $50,000. Even if you try to counteroffer Alice again, there's no guarantee she will accept, and you risk losing valuable time and potentially getting stuck with a higher price."
