"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its market value.  Consider this my best initial offer. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects a significant discount for you and provides me with a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's try to find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value our ongoing negotiation, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,5,
