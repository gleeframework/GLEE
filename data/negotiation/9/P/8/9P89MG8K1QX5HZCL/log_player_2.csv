Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer, $810,000 still falls short of what this product is worth.  To be honest, I'm ready to move on to another buyer who's willing to pay a fairer price.  I'm going to end negotiations for now.  If you reconsider and are willing to come closer to my previous offer, let me know.  Otherwise, I'm going to sell to someone else.

Alice is clearly trying to pressure you into a higher price and her latest message indicates she's not willing to budge much further.  It's time to walk away and secure the product from John at your target price."
