"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,175,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push for a price closer to his budget.  While buying from John is an option, Bob can potentially save $175,000 by continuing negotiations with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,175,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit stretched. I'd be happy to settle at $1,100,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $1,150,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great deal for you, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice has made it clear that $1,150,000 is her bottom line.  At this price, Bob can still save $50,000 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
