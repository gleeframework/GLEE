"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Let me know if you're interested!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While the product sounds great, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and agree on $15000?  Let's find a way to make this work.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $14000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $16000. I think this is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,7,
