Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm still very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. Could we settle on $750,000?  I think this represents a fair compromise.

We're still significantly below what John is offering.  Bob is clearly interested and moving in the right direction. Let's see if we can negotiate him up further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still beyond what I'm able to spend. To be honest, I have another offer for $800,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm ready to move forward with the other offer if we can't reach an agreement. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?

This is a good spot to accept. Here's why:

* **Bob's Max Value:** Bob has revealed that the product is worth $800,000 to him by stating this is his final offer.  It's unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **Time and Risk:** We still have time, but continuing the negotiation has risks. Bob might walk away, forcing us to accept John's offer, which, while guaranteeing our minimum, doesn't allow us to potentially get more.
* **Solid Profit:** While not the $1,300,000 we started at, $800,000 is a strong profit."
