Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Focus on value:** I mention that I think Bob will ""really enjoy"" the product. This subtly implies value without directly stating it, which can influence Bob's perception. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I maximize my chances of getting a good price while still leaving the possibility of a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's still worthwhile to try and get a bit more.  I can try to negotiate higher by sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? "", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer to show that I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Compromise language:**  I use the phrase ""meet in the middle"" to imply that I'm willing to compromise and find a solution that's fair to both of us. 
* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:**  While I'm willing to come down from my initial price, I'm still trying to get a bit more than Bob's offer. This shows that I'm not desperate to sell at the lowest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is just $5 more than my minimum acceptable price and my fallback option (selling to John). Accepting this offer maximizes my profit without risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a delay in the sale."
