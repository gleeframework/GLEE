Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) as I don't know Bob's value for the product. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value to Bob to pique his interest.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm leaving room for counteroffers, allowing for a negotiation process.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm prepared to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $12,000 is still below my minimum price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, potentially closer to my initial asking price.
* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer to see if I can close the gap closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still leaves me some margin, but I'm confident the value of this product will exceed this price for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a slight compromise, showing flexibility while still being above my minimum price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential value to justify the price.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm aiming to bridge the gap between our positions, creating a win-win scenario. 
* **Final Offer:**  I'm positioning this as a potential final offer to encourage Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is above my minimum price of $10,000. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, especially considering John's offer of $10,000. 
* **Secure Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation breaking down."
