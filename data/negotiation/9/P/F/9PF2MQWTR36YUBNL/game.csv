"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a little high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from the original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000.  Would you consider $750,000?  It's a strong offer and would allow us to close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to $700,000 as possible, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $800,000, which is still a discount from the original offer. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
