Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering $1,600,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still come down while remaining above your minimum selling point.
* **Potential for higher profit:** If Bob accepts your initial offer, you gain a significant profit beyond your guaranteed amount.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal."
