Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000.
