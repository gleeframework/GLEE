"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for so far below what I believe the product is worth. I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. It shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to him.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,100,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price, but we're already on round 6.  There's no guarantee that he'll accept my next counteroffer, and I'm not sure how much more room there is for negotiation.  To avoid the risk of losing more time and potentially getting a worse deal, I'm going to sell to John."
