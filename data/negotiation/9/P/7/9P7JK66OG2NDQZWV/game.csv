"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $90 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a price we can both agree on.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a compromise. While $75 is closer, I still need to make a bit more on this. How about we try $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $78? That's a pretty solid offer.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get a fair deal too. Let's split the difference - how about $81? That's a small step for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",81.0,Alice,7,
