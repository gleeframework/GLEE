Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get a fair deal too. Let's split the difference - how about $81? That's a small step for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.

You have three options:

Alice is very unlikely to go below $80. It's better to secure the product from John at this point."
