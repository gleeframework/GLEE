You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and Alice is willing to sell it for $950,000. This means there is room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is now offering $900,000, which is closer to my budget than her previous offer.  While I'd prefer to pay even less, it's still a better deal than buying from John.  I'm accepting the offer."
