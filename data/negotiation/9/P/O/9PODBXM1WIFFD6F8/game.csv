"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
