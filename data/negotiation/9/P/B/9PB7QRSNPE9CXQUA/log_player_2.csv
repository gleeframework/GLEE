(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to my maximum.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum of $12,000, but closer than before. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  I have a few rounds left and can still buy from John if a better deal isn't possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer, but still staying within my maximum budget.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also limits the risk of overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now at my maximum price. There's no point in risking losing the deal by counteroffering further, especially since I can buy from John at the same price.  Accepting now guarantees I get the product within my budget."
