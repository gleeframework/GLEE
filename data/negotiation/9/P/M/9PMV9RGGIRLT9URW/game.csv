"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $16000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $14000 yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $16500. This is a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is the lowest you're willing to go, Bob. I'm not willing to go that low, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $15000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. However, I want to remind you that I have another buyer interested in the product, and I may need to consider their offer if we can't come to an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your reminder about the other buyer, but I'm not willing to pay $15000. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, and that's my final offer. If I don't get a better price, I'll have to consider buying from the other buyer.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $14000, but I need to emphasize that this is my absolute final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to the other buyer.",14000.0,Alice,9,
