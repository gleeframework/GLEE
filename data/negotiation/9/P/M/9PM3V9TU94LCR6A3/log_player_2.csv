{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You have room to negotiate and a good backup option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I won't be overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and while it's getting closer, I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. It's better to keep negotiating and see if I can get Alice to lower her price further.  Also, John is a reliable backup option, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.  I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm serious about buying but still pushing for a better price. It's a compromise, but I'm confident I can secure a lower price if I keep negotiating."
