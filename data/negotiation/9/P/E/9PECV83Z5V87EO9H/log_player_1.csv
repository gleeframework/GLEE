Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still not quite there.  How about $1100000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling $1150000 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us move forward.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

$1,150,000 is still below my minimum. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to stay closer to my minimum value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with an even lower price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I meet my minimum and get a guaranteed deal."
