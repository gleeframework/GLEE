"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the interest in selling me the product, but my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $8000? I understand that might be below your asking price, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the market value for this item.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I have to say that $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. While $12000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for something closer to $8000. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11000. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer of $11000. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8000. I understand that this may be challenging, but I hope we can find common ground. Would you be open to discussing other aspects of the transaction that could potentially reduce the cost for me without compromising your profit margin?",8000.0,Bob,6,
