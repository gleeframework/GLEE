Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the interest in selling me the product, but my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $8000? I understand that might be below your asking price, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the market value for this item.
