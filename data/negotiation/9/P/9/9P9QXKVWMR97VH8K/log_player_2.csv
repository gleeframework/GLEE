"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product that I know you're interested in. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, so I'm proposing a price of $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $95 is better than John's $100, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $100.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can negotiate with John or potentially find an even better deal elsewhere."
