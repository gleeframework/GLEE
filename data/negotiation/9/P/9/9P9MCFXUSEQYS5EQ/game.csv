"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $13500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I really appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product, but I was thinking maybe we could meet in the middle of that and $12500. How about $12750? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,6,
