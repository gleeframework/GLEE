"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $820000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your organization.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $760000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're close to reaching a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820000 and $760000, which would be $890000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your organization.",890000.0,Alice,5,
