Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $145. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still higher than my minimum acceptable value, but also closer to Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable value of $150. While it's still a bit lower, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $140."
