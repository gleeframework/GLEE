"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
