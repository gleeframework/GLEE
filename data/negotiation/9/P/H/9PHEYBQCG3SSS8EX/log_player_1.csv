Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value it holds for Bob while still ensuring a profit above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $100 is a strong starting point, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob (who values the product more) and maximizing your potential profit."
