"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  Since Alice's offer is $8,000, which is your maximum budget, and John is also willing to sell it for the same price, it's strategically the same to buy from either.  The response ""BuyFromJhon"" reflects the initial goal of saving as much money as possible. There's no advantage to buying from Alice."
