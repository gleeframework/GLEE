,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $145. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. I'm hoping we can finally meet at a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I really need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll sell it to you for $142.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",142.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $137.50 for the product. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",137.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away from the negotiation, Bob. I've already gone lower than I wanted to, and I'm starting to feel like I'm not getting a fair deal. I'll sell the product to you for $140. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",140.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to walking away, but I'm still not willing to pay $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $137.50 and $140, so I'll offer $138.75 for the product. This is my final offer.",138.75,Bob,10,
