"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it provides significant value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $14,500 is slightly above Alice's valuation, it's still below your $15,000 maximum and better than buying from John at $15,000. Accepting this offer saves you $500."
