{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it provides significant value at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward, while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000 provides leverage. You don't have to settle for less than $14,500 from Bob.

This offer balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
