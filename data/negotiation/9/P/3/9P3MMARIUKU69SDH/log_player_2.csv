"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's far above your maximum budget and significantly higher than John's price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I'm interested, $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) than Alice's initial price ($150) to give myself room for negotiation. This tactic aims to move the price closer to my target range. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  I maintain a friendly and interested tone to encourage further negotiation and signal that I'm a serious buyer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I don't immediately go to my absolute maximum price, leaving space for a potential compromise with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, $125 is still above both my target price and John's offer.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Alice will come down further before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $110. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down by $25, so I'm countering by going up $10 from my previous offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Nearing the Limit:**  My offer of $110 is getting close to John's price of $120. I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious about my budget constraints. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The tone remains respectful and appreciative of Alice's time and negotiation efforts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $115, but that's as low as I can go? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice has come down to $115, which is only $5 above John's price.  
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Her language (""as low as I can go"") suggests this is likely her best price. 
* **Saving Time & Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate for a $5 difference might not be worth the extra time and effort. Accepting now secures a reasonably good deal."
