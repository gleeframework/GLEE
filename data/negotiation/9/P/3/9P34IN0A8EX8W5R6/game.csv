"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $105 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $120? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $116?  That would be a fair price, and we could close the deal quickly. ",116.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! How about we make it $114 and call it a deal?",114.0,Bob,6,
