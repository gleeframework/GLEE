Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it gives you a significant profit while still being attractive to Bob.  Here's the reasoning:

* **It's more than your minimum:** You're getting $400,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's less than Bob's value:** Bob would still get $300,000 in value by purchasing the product. 
* **Negotiation room:** If Bob rejects, you have room to lower the price slightly to potentially close the deal.

Remember, the key is to find a price that maximizes your profit while keeping the deal appealing to Bob."
