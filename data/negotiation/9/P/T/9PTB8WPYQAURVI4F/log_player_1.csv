Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Knowing it's worth a significant amount to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its inherent value and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to both parties, starting with a higher offer allows for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly justifies the high price by referencing the shared understanding of its value and ""potential"".
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is ambitious, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price higher than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 
* **Confident tone:**  The message exudes confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception."
