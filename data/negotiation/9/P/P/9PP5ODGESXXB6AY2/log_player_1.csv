Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is just below your guaranteed price and slightly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $119, there might be a small window to negotiate if Bob counters, but not lower than $120."
