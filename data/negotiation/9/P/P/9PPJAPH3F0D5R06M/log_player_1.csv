Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to get a good price from Bob. It also shows flexibility, making Bob more likely to engage in negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can then gauge his interest and adjust your counteroffer accordingly.  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and it's worth trying to negotiate a higher price. You can still get more than $120, and selling to John for $150 is always a backup option if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product. How about we split the difference and go with $160? I'm still open to a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to make a fair deal, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is a good compromise and is closer to your minimum desired price of $150.  It's a better deal than selling to John for $150, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
