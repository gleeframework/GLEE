"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low, and I can get $12,000 from John if I need to. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation. I'm confident that I can secure a higher price or, if necessary, sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to $10,000.  How about $10,200? That's a fair compromise, and it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to $10,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200. Would you consider $9,900? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,900 is still a little low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price or sell to John for $12,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,900, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $10,100?  That's only $200 more than your last offer, and it gets us very close to a deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but I don't think I can go any higher. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, Bob is still unwilling to meet me halfway. At this point, I've only got two rounds left and I'm running out of time. I've decided to sell to John for $12,000. It's the best outcome for me at this point."
