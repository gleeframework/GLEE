"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference - $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about we settle at $1,175,000?  It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 is still too far from my desired price.  To show I'm willing to compromise, I'm coming down to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident this price is a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
