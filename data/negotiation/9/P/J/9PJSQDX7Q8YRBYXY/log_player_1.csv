"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and to kick off the negotiation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Near Bob's Value:** The offer is slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to immediately grab his attention and make him seriously consider the deal. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The offer leaves some room for negotiation (a potential $50,000 profit for Bob) but keeps Alice well above her minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to anchor the negotiation high while demonstrating a willingness to engage in a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for you. 

While his offer is low, it indicates he's interested. You should counter in the next round, aiming to bring the negotiation closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I have in mind. To move this forward, I can go down to $1,375,000. This price reflects the true value of this product, and I believe it's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** The counteroffer drops considerably from the initial $1,450,000 to $1,375,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, it remains significantly above both your $1,200,000 minimum and Bob's low offer, signaling that you're serious about achieving a fair price.
* **Justification:**  Providing a brief reason for the counteroffer (""reflects the true value"") adds weight to your position and moves away from appearing arbitrary.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,375,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,287,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,287,500 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $87,500. 

While you could try to negotiate further, Bob is clearly anchoring his offers around $1,200,000.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away. Taking a sure profit now is the most logical decision."
