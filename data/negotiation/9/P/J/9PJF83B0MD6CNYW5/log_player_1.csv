Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is what I believe the product is worth. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is already offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation.
