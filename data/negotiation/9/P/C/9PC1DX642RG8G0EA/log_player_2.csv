"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $130 is cheaper than Alice's initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  It's in your best interest to see if Alice will lower the price further or go with your backup option."
