"Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is $80, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $80.  How about $90? This is my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $100. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
