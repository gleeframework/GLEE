The product is worth no more than $10,000 to you. Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will get Alice to come down a bit."

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum. I'll reject and try to counteroffer again."

I'm going to increase my offer to $9,500.  This is closer to Alice's last offer and hopefully shows that I'm serious about buying, but it's still below my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice is not budging on her price, and it's getting closer to my maximum.  I'm going to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed price that fits within my budget."
