"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still not a price Bob is willing to accept. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best option to try to secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our time spent negotiating."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  Bob is increasing his offer from $7,500 to $8,250, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  
* **Fairness Appeal:** Bob emphasizes that $8,250 is fair based on the product's value and the negotiation process.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for a potential compromise, as it's still below Alice's offer of $9,000."
