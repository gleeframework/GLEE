"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,250.  Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to accept $10,000.  It's a good price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
