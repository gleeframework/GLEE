"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget and what John is offering. While it's a ""good deal"" compared to Alice's valuation, we have room to negotiate and try to get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This serves two purposes:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  It lets us see how much she's willing to move from her initial price. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if she rejects this offer outright, it gives us space to gradually increase our offer over subsequent rounds. 

It's a bold move, but we have John as a backup option if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice decreased her price, but it's still higher than John's offer. We're getting closer to a potential deal, but we can push a little further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go closer to $10,000, especially as we get closer to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250?"",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer demonstrates willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's last offer.
* **Strategic positioning:**  By splitting the difference between her previous offer ($10,500) and ours ($8,000), we nudge the negotiation closer to our desired range. 
* **Time constraint:**  With fewer rounds remaining, we need to accelerate the negotiation towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,250.  Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to accept $10,000.  It's a good price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our target price! There's no point in further negotiation or going to John since we've achieved the best possible outcome.  We get the product at the price we were aiming for."
