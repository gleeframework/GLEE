Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation.  I'm aware Bob values the product at $15,000, so I'm leaving room for potential compromise while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can achieve a better price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, continuing to push for a higher price.  I'm aware of John's offer as a safety net, but I want to maximize my potential earnings from Bob if possible."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than John's offer. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether. It's better to secure a profit now than to continue negotiating and potentially lose the sale completely."
