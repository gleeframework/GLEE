# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below her stated minimum of $850,000.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, making that the better option."
