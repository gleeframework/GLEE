"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to meet you halfway.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly settle on $10,200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I believe I can get closer to $11,000 if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $10,350? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $10,300 as the final price for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I'm comfortable with. I've already rejected Bob's offer a few times, and I don't want to risk him walking away altogether. Plus, I'm running out of rounds. Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but I'm hoping to get a bit more if I can."
