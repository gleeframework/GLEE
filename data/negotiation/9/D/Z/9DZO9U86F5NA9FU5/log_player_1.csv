Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $17,500. This gives me a good starting point and allows for some negotiation room.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer of $15,000, but I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than selling to John for $15,000, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $16,500. This shows some flexibility while still being above Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will lead to a better price. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $15,000, which is a better option than risking more negotiation rounds with Bob."
