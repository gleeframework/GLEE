"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recover some of my investment. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $7,500. How about we settle at $8,000? This is a fair price for both of us. It's the best I can do, and it's closer to my bottom line.",8000.0,Alice,5,
