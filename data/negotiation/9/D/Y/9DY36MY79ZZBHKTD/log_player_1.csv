Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its value will be even greater for you in the long run."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always beneficial to explore if I can get a higher price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets it for $300,000 less than its actual worth to him, and I gain an extra $100,000 compared to selling to John. 
* **Direct & Confident Tone:** The message is crafted to highlight the product's value and justify the price without revealing my guaranteed buyer. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for me while offering Bob a genuinely good deal."
