"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  This product offers significant value, and I could easily hold onto it for a higher offer.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $975,000 is close, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours and land at $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but no higher. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",990000.0,Bob,6,
