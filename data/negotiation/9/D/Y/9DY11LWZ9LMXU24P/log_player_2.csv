{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and see if you can get a better price.  You have a safety net with John's offer, so there's no need to rush into an expensive deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with John's price as your base, I'm offering Alice $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and a strong starting point for negotiation."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. I have a secure backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,500,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but it's still a considerable discount from her current offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
