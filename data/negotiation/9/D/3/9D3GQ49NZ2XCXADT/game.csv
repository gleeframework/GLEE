"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for something lower. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to walking away from this deal, but I'm still willing to make one more effort to reach an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",10250.0,Alice,7,
