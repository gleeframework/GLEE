Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than you do or is willing to pay a premium for immediate acquisition. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a limited-time offer, you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $1,500,000 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a substantial profit over your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could choose to offer a lower price initially, aiming for a quick and easy sale.  The best approach depends on your risk tolerance and how much you believe Bob might be willing to pay."
