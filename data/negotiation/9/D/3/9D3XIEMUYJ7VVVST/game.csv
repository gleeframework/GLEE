"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this unique product. I value it highly, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to a reasonable price. How about $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. This product is a unique opportunity. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little on the price, but it's still too high.  I'm willing to offer $750,000, but that's my limit.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I understand the need to find common ground. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000  - this is a significant reduction and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer.  We are getting closer, but we're still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come up to $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference and make this deal happen right now for $1,100,000? This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
