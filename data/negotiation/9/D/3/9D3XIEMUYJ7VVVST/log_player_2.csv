It's time to cut bait and go with John.  

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000, especially after stating her last offer was final. You've negotiated well, but every counteroffer from her is trying to anchor you closer to that $1,100,000 mark.  

You have a guaranteed option to get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation with Alice."
