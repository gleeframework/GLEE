"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair and represents a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $1,800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 significantly undervalues this product. I'm willing to make a final offer at $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
