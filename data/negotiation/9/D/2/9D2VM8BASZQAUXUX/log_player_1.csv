"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this deal and accept."

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."

We're running out of rounds, and Bob isn't budging much.  I'm getting closer to my minimum but I don't want to risk him continuing to lowball me.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get my desired price."
