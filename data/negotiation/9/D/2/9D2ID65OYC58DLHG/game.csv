"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,4,
