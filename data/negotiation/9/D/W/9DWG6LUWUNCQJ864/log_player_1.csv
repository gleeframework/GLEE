Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning the ""unique value"" might pique Bob's interest and make him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" suggests you're open to discussing the price further, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit but acknowledges the risk that Bob might reject the offer. If you want to guarantee a sale, a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) would be more appropriate."
