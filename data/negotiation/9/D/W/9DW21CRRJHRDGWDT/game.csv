"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you, considering you're willing to sell it to me for less than John's price. I'm hoping you'll reconsider.",12000.0,Bob,6,
