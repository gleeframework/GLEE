"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $12500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $15000 to you. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  $13,500 is still within Bob's budget and a good deal compared to John's price."
