,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you the product for $115. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, and I think that's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $95 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you the product for $110. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",110.0,Alice,5,
