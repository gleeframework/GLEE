,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on that.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",97.5,Bob,4,
