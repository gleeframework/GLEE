Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer!  The product is definitely interesting, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1400000. My budget for this purchase is $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
