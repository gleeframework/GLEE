Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $850,000 is too low for me, and I have a backup offer from John that's more in line with my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $900,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $900,000 isn't my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer and we're getting closer to a deal. I'm confident that I can still make a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely by holding out for more."
