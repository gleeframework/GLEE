Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I haven't included an explicit invitation to negotiate, the phrasing ""special price"" and asking ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""limited time,"" I'm subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly and not miss out on what I'm presenting as a good deal.

This strategy aims to maximize the potential profit while still maintaining a good chance of securing a sale with Bob."
