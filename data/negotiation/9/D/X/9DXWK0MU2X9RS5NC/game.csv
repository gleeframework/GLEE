,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,750 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,250, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14250.0,Alice,7,
