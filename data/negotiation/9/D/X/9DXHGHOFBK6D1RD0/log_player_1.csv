"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is an aggressive opening offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  It's important to remember:

* **I don't know Bob's value for the product.** This initial offer is a starting point for negotiation.
* **I have a safety net.**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is a game of strategy.**  Starting high allows me to potentially secure a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I'm not ready to accept it yet. 

* **Negotiation is a dance.** I'm willing to give a little, but I still see room for improvement. 
* **I have leverage.** I have John as a backup, so I don't need to rush into an agreement. 
* **By rejecting Bob's offer, I can signal my intention to continue negotiating.** This might encourage Bob to come back with a higher counteroffer. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer with a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a substantial profit margin. 

* **Strategic compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial $2,000,000 offer, but still above Bob's current offer.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  I am not willing to accept Bob's current price yet, aiming to keep the negotiation moving in my favor.
* **Assessing Bob's response:**  This round will provide valuable insight into Bob's willingness to negotiate and his estimated value for the product."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept it. Here's why:

* **Room for improvement:**  I believe there's still potential to close the deal closer to my desired price. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds left, I have enough time to continue negotiating.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John and still make a substantial profit.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,800,000. This is a significant move closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise. 

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is right in the middle between my previous offer ($1,900,000) and Bob's last offer ($1,700,000).
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price, but also recognizing that time is ticking.
* **Assessing Bob's response:**  This round will be crucial to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is only $100,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However,  considering the following:

* **Time is running out:**  I've only got 4 rounds left.
* **The gap is closing:** Bob is consistently coming down in price.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Even though this is a lower profit, it's still a guaranteed profit.

It's a risk, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. This is a solid profit, and continuing to negotiate might mean losing the deal entirely."
