"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  It's likely that Bob can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly closer to his own valuation but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also aims to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $11,500 is better than the initial $12,000, it's still above his ideal price. He can likely get a better deal with further negotiation, as Alice has already shown willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we settle on $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money but is now moving closer to Alice's last offer. He's demonstrating his interest while still showing he's not willing to overpay. This counteroffer might encourage Alice to accept, as it's only a small difference from her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. How about we try $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $11,750 is a good price, it's still above his ideal price.  He has made significant progress in negotiations and can likely continue to push for a lower price. The difference between Bob's last offer and Alice's current offer is only $750.  He's still in a good position to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $11,750 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and try $11,375?"", ""product_price"": 11375}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he is now making a more modest counteroffer. He is showing Alice that he is willing to compromise, but he is still determined to get the best possible price. He is also highlighting the fact that the difference between their offers is small, making it more likely that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. I'm willing to make another small concession. How about we try $11,900? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is still lower, $11,900 represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $15,000.  The negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers may result in a stalemate or Alice walking away.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price with only three rounds remaining."
