Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,500?  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
