# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.
