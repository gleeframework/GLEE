"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $850000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $810000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",810000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $810000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $780000, which is closer to your price and a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can finalise a deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $820000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",820000.0,Alice,5,
