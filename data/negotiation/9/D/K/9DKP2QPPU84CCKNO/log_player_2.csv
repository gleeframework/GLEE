"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a significant profit. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at a lower price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is better than buying from John for $1,200,000. While it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, it saves Bob $50,000."
