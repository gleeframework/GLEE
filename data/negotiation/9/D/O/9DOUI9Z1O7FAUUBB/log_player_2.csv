"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is above your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a bit lower than Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still above my maximum budget of $100. I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject this offer and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $105.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer of $105. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting the product for that price, and I'm hoping she'll reconsider. If she doesn't accept, I still have the option to buy from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $105. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $112.50. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.50 is still above my budget. While it is a lower price than her previous offer, it's still not within my comfort zone. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. If Alice won't budge, I'll likely go with John's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $112.50 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to buy this product right now for $108.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $108, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'm still within my budget and believe this is a fair offer that is closer to Alice's desired price. If Alice rejects this, I'm prepared to purchase from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to come to an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $110. I think this is as low as I can go and still make a profit. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above my budget. While it's closer than before, I'm getting a bit nervous that we won't come to an agreement.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking a further rejection and potentially missing out on the opportunity to buy from John at a guaranteed $100.  I'll take the safe option and purchase from John."
