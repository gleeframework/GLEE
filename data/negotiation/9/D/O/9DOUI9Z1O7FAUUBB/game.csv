"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $105.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $105. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $112.50. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for you.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $112.50 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to buy this product right now for $108.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",108.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to come to an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $110. I think this is as low as I can go and still make a profit. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal.",110.0,Alice,7,
