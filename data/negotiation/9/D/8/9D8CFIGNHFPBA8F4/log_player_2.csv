"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  That would be a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still a good deal for Alice considering her value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer establishes a clear point for negotiations. It shows Bob is serious about buying but needs a better price.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $9,000 leaves room for Alice to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above Bob's budget of $8,000.
* **Negotiation:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and Bob should continue to push for a better price.  
* **Room for Compromise:**  $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum, but there's a chance Alice might budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the price.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer.  
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is his final offer, Bob is adding pressure and increasing the chance of Alice accepting.
* **Strategic Increase:** $9,500 is closer to Alice's desired price, but still within Bob's comfort zone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're serious about the product.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  It's a small increase, and it's the most I can offer at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice has lowered her offer, $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Negotiation:** Bob has been consistent in his desire to get the price down, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potential for Lower Offer:**  There's still a chance Alice might budge further, especially since Bob has stated his final offer.  
* **Buy from John Option:**  If the negotiations continue to stall, Bob can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can go without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is reiterating this is his final offer to put pressure on Alice.
* **Small Increase:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.
