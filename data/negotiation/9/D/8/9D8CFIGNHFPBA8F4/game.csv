"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  That would be a good starting point for us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're serious about the product.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  It's a small increase, and it's the most I can offer at this point.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can go without exceeding my budget.",9750.0,Bob,6,
