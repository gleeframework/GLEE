"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product valued at $10,000 by you, at a discount. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer of $9,500 is already a great deal as it's well below your $10,000 maximum and provides significant savings. There's no guarantee of getting a better price even with further negotiation, and it risks losing the deal altogether."
