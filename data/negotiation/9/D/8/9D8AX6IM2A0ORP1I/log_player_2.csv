Alice's offer:

It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $111? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

We've reached a point where further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.  Alice is clearly holding firm around the $110 mark. Accepting the $111 offer secures a reasonable deal without risking the certainty of John's $150 price."
