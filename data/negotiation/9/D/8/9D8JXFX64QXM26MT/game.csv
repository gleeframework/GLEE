"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its market value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $775,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer. While $775,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hesitant to go that high.  Would you be open to $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000, but I need to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $725,000, but I'll throw in a special bonus package worth $25,000. This will make the total value of the deal $750,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,7,
