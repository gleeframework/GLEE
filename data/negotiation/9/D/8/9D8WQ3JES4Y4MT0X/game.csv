"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I'd be willing to go up to $980,000. That's the absolute max I can afford. Can you meet me at that price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
