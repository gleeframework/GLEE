"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering your asking price and the value it holds for me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise given the value of the product for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
