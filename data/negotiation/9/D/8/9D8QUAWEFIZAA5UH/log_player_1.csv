{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its potential worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a fair price considering the value Bob places on the product.  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, while also ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering your asking price and the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is above my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise given the value of the product for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
