Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good deal.  I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still a bit higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is also willing to pay $80. It's best to accept and secure the sale now."
