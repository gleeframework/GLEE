"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm willing to accept.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the price from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most cost-effective choice."
