"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do think the product is great, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $9,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",8500.0,Alice,7,
