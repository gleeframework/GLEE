"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9500.",9500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"Hello Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13000. What do you think?"
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've done my research and I know this product is worth more than $13000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $14000. What do you think is a fair price for this incredible product?",14000.0,Alice,3,,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13500.",13500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to work with me. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $14500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $14250?"
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think is a fair price for this incredible product?",14000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your efforts, Alice, but I still believe we can find a better solution. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13800.",13800.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much profit. How about we try $13900?"
"I've thought it through, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $13900. However, I want to make it clear that this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm looking at other potential buyers, and I'm not sure I want to wait any longer to sell this product. What do you say?",13900.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I understand your position, Alice, but I believe we can still find a middle ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13700.",13700.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $13900, Bob. I'm starting to think it's time for me to explore other options. I'm going to give you one last chance to meet me at $13900, but if you're not willing to do that, I'm going to have to move on to other buyers. This is my last offer, so think carefully before responding."
"I've made it clear what I'm willing to accept, Bob. I'm not going to go any lower than $13900. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to sell this product to someone else. I'm giving you one final chance to make a decision. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other buyers. The price is $13900, take it or leave it.",13900.0,Alice,9,,
