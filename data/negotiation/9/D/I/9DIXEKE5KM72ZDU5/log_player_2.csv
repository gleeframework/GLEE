"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! Unfortunately, that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer significantly below your actual budget ($80) gives you room to negotiate upwards. This tactic aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice came down significantly, $90 is still above your budget. There's room for further negotiation. You'll reject this offer and try to nudge her closer to your price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You're moving closer to her price, indicating you're serious about the purchase.
* **Stays below your maximum:** You're still aiming for a price that benefits you.
* **Provides a strong position:** If she completely rejects this, you can either slightly increase your offer in the next round or take John's deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $85. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down considerably and is now only slightly above your maximum budget.  While you could try to haggle further, there's a chance she won't budge, and you'd end up paying John's price anyway. Accepting $85 secures the product and saves you $5 compared to John's offer."
