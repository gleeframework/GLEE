"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial to your company. I'm aware it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and while I value it at significantly more, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential value.  I'm asking $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings compared to what other buyers are willing to pay, and it allows for a healthy profit margin for you.  Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price.
