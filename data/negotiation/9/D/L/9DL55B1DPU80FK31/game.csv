,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is significantly below its actual value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low. How about we settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're close to the final stretch, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000 is still too high.
