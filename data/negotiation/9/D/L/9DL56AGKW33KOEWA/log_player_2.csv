"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is too high for him, and he can get the product for $800,000 from John. He should counteroffer Alice and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1100000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can still get the product from John for $800,000. He should counteroffer Alice again, aiming for a price closer to his budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can't go as high as $1,100,000.  I'm still firm at $800,000. It's the absolute most I can afford. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. "", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm at $800000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above his budget.  Since he can get the product from John for a price that works for him, it's best to avoid further negotiation with Alice."
