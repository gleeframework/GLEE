"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to offer $750,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value to me and the potential for future collaboration. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my target price. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $800,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me and would allow us to finalize the transaction. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge further. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. I'm proposing a new offer of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope it's acceptable to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
