""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Create Urgency:** Offering a slightly discounted price creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly before he loses the deal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting high leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.

By offering the product at $11,999, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a sale with Bob while still making a significant profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at $12,000."
