"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $82 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $75. Would you be willing to meet me there?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $79? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept.",79.0,Alice,5,
