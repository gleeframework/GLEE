Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price, as it provides a lot of value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is valid, briefly highlighting the product's value might make Bob more amenable to the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests there might be flexibility, encouraging Bob to engage even if he finds the initial price a bit steep. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:** While we know the product's value to Bob, he might not be willing to pay his maximum.  There's always a risk he'll reject the offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup guarantees Alice at least $120. This knowledge gives Alice leverage in the negotiation."
