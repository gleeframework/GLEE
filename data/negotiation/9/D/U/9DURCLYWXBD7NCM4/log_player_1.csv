"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm confident in the value of the product and want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I'll try to counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth significantly more.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,250,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better deal. I'm confident that with some more back and forth, we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."

It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
