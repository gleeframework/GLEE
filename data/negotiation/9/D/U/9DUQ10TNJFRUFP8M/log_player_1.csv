Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly implies he'd be getting a good deal even at the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer.
* **Market Conditions:** If the product is in high demand, you could potentially push for an even higher price."
