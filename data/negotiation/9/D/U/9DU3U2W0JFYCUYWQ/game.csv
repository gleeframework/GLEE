"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my maximum budget and its potential value to me. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for it, which is a good compromise and a significant step closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
