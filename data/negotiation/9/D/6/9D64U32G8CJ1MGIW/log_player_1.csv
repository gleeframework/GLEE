Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer of $150 matches what John is willing to pay. Since my goal is to maximize profit, there's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob. Accepting John's offer guarantees the sale at my minimum acceptable price."
