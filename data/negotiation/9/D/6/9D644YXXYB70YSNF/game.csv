"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in this product, and I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 might be a bit too high, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still just a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  Let's close this deal!",10600.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,700. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10700.0,Alice,7,
