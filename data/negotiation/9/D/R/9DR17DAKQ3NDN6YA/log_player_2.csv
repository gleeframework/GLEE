"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above your maximum budget and more than you would pay John. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at your maximum budget of $12,000."
