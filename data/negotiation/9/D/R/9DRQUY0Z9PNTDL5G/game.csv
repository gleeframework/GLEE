"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to sell this product to you,  $8000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $10000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
