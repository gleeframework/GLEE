"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12000. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to sell this product to you,  $8000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $10000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down from her original price, $10,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay.  He can get the same product for $8,000 from John, making that the best option."
