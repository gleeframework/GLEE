Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product to make the offer more appealing.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, indicating a willingness to find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Safety Net:** John provides a guaranteed $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price.

**This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing the sale and the potential for a better counteroffer from Bob.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).** Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price.** This gives me the leverage to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.**  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to sell this product to you,  $8,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate but not accepting his low price.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing good faith, but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation going. 

This strategy aims to reach a middle ground, maximizing my profit while still leaving space for further negotiation."
