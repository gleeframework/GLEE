Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not able to meet the price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
