You should reject Alice's offer. You're aiming to get the product for under $800,000, and $900,000 is still too high.  Counteroffering gives you a chance to try and get a better deal."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $750,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good price, and it leaves room for negotiation."

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still above my ideal price.  I'll reject and counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my goal of $800,000."

I'm going to counter with $825,000. This is a smaller step than before, showing I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a better deal than Alice's last offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is very close to my target, but it's still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm confident that John will sell me the product for my desired price, so I'll take that deal and save myself the time and effort of further negotiations."
