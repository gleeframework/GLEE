"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000. This is a serious offer and reflects the value I see in this product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the minimum value I'm looking for, and $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
