"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's wise to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate. There are 9 more rounds, so there's room to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a serious offer and reflects the value I see in this product. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showcasing Bob's serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for the lower price, framing it as a reflection of his perceived value.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The counteroffer leaves room for negotiation, potentially leading to a price that's agreeable for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the minimum value I'm looking for, and $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,500,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. 
* **No Further Negotiation:**  There's no room for a better price.  
* **Value Comparison:**  While Bob could buy the product from John for the same price, Alice's offer potentially represents a better deal if the product's true value is closer to her initial asking price.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Rejecting Alice's offer risks losing out on a potentially valuable product, especially given the limited rounds remaining."
