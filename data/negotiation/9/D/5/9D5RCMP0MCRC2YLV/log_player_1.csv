{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering $135, which is higher than Bob's valuation ($120) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This creates room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By not going for my full asking price, I show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** While I can sell to John for $150, it's better to try and get a higher price from Bob. This offer allows me to potentially secure a better deal without risking losing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's also below my initial offer, which means I'm unlikely to make a profit at that price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, his initial interest indicates a willingness to buy. This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Selling to John for $150 would guarantee a profit, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price by continuing negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is still above his current offer but closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's last offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable deal for myself.
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning ""fair price for both of us"", I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value for Bob might incentivize him to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer. If he rejects it, I'll have to re-evaluate my options, considering the risk of losing the deal to John."
