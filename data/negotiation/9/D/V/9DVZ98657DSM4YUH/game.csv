"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is reflected.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a good compromise and would ensure a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
