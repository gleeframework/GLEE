{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below your minimum desired price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. It also shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $9,500? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000. That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally get closer to my target of $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Further negotiation might take more time and risk losing the deal altogether. It's more prudent to accept this offer and move forward."
