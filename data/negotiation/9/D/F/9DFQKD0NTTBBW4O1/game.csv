"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while acknowledging your potential profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand the need to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to maximize your profit, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
