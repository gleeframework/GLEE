Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while acknowledging your potential profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to maximize your profit, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.

Bob is holding firm at a price significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll move substantially higher.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
