"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still higher than his desired price point, and he has room to negotiate.  He should try to get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to his price range, it's still above his preferred maximum. He should continue negotiating to try and get the price down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is closer to my budget and reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $9,500 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a good price point for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal work. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While $11,000 is getting closer to his ideal price, he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's still got time and has a safety net with John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you considering your minimum."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,500.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there!  I'm willing to go down to $10,400. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal and make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's price range, it's unlikely he'll be able to get her down to his target price of $8,000 with only one round left.  John's offer guarantees him the best deal and avoids the risk of failing to come to an agreement with Alice."
