{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, which is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Your Guaranteed Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you should aim for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation but potentially lower than your guaranteed offer to entice him. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,300,000  leaves some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.

By starting at $1,300,000, you are:

* Aiming high to maximize potential profit.
* Still offering Bob a price lower than your guaranteed sale price.
* Leaving space for potential negotiation.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're not losing anything as you can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
