"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This aligns with my budget and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer. While I understand the value of the product, $1,080,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,065,000. This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?",1065000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do a bit better than that. How about $1,075,000? I'm confident that the product's value will be worth it for you in the long run.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
