Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,200. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $8,800? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for Bob.  He's getting the product for $100 less than his maximum budget, and it's only $100 more than Alice's minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate might save him a little more, but it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away."
