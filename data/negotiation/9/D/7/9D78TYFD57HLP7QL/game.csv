"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This reflects the product's value and gives you a fair price. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price point.  $1400000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's do $1500000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, and it ensures both of us get a good deal.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
