It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price.  $8,500 is a good starting point, but there's likely room to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is being stubborn. I'm willing to pay a little more, but I want to see if she'll come down further.  Let's try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

I'm going to offer $7,500.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one.  Hopefully, she'll see that I'm serious about buying the product and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $7,750, which is a good price.  I could keep trying to negotiate, but the risk is that she'll walk away or I'll run out of rounds.  It's a good deal compared to John's price, so I'll accept."
