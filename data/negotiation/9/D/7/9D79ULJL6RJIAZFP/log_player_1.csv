Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find quite valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a significant gain over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey the product's value to Bob without seeming too aggressive.  It acknowledges his potential interest (""you'll find quite valuable"").
 
**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product. 
* Depending on the context and my relationship with Bob, I might adjust my approach to be more or less assertive."
