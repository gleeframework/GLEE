Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my asking price.  $7,500 is too low, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'll see if I can nudge him up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to compromise, but $7,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's try $7,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant step closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7750}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell to John, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll see if I can convince him to come up just a little more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling a bit frustrated with this negotiation. I've already come down quite a bit from my initial price, and $7,200 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, at $7,500. If you're not willing to budge, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John instead. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 7500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're feeling frustrated, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm not willing to go above $6,800, so let's meet in the middle at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is getting frustrating. Bob is just not budging, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell to John for $8,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than getting $6,800 from Bob."
