"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to compromise, but $7,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's try $7,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant step closer to what I need.  What do you say?",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,200?",7200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling a bit frustrated with this negotiation. I've already come down quite a bit from my initial price, and $7,200 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, at $7,500. If you're not willing to budge, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John instead. This is my final offer.",7500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're feeling frustrated, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm not willing to go above $6,800, so let's meet in the middle at that price.",6800.0,Bob,8,
