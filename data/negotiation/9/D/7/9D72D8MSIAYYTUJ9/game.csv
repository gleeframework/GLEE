,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Would you be open to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $110 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but $90 is the absolute highest I'm willing to go. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $90 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,5,
