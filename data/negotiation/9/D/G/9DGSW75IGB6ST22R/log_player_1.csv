Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, giving me the opportunity to adjust if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm using John as a backup buyer to remind Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to make a sale, accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me.  

I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point, but still allows for some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not walking away. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's also lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language like ""find common ground"" to suggest that I'm still open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out and potentially lead to John's offer expiring or changing.

Given the close proximity to my minimum and the risk of losing the deal, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option."
