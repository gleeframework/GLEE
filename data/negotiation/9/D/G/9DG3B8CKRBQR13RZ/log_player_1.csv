Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's valuation.  
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Hinting at other potential buyers (even if unspecified) can encourage Bob to act quickly."
