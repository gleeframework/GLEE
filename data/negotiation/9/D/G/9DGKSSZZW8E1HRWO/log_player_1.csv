At this point, Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,100,000.  However, continuing to negotiate is likely to take more time and may not lead to a significantly better price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the most beneficial option, as it guarantees a much higher profit."
