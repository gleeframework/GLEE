{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You aim to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible while still ensuring a sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below his perceived value ($11,500) allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price point is significantly higher than your backup offer from John ($10,000), maximizing your potential profit."
