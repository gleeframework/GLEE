"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still offers you a good value considering your own assessment of its worth. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant move on my part.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply too far off from my minimum.  Let's try $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise given your assessment of the product's value, and it's closer to my expectations.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this negotiation is taking longer than expected.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 as my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand this has been a long negotiation, but I'm still hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
