Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he can bring the price down.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""demand,"" you're creating the impression that the product is highly desirable and might go quickly to other buyers.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the offer is high, it's not so outrageous that Bob might be completely turned off.  If he rejects, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price."
