"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your honesty. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. This is closer to its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Please let me know if this works for you.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $120, my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $135 for the product. This is higher than your last offer but still below the value it holds for me. I hope this proposal works for you.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $127.50. This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",127.5,Bob,6,
