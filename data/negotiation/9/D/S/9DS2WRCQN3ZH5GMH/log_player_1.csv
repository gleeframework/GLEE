"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and establish a strong initial position. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the unique nature and worth of the product may encourage Bob to see its potential value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys I'm open to negotiation while still setting a clear expectation of a high price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the information I gather during the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly over my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can only offer $600000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $800,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate. This suggests there's room to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a better price in future rounds.

**Next Steps:** I'll analyze Bob's message and counteroffer with a counteroffer in Round 3 to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for this product.  I understand your budget constraints, but this is a unique opportunity you won't find elsewhere. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:** I'm starting my counteroffer at $850,000, still well above my minimum of $800,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Compromise and Flexibility:**  By offering a lower price than my initial offer, I demonstrate I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Highlighting Uniqueness:**  I reiterate the product's unique value to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Asking for Feedback:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to keep the conversation flowing and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:**  I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses. If he's still unwilling to meet my price, I might start considering selling to John in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $775000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 threshold. Accepting it would mean a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate and offer a compromise indicates there's still room for a deal.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I maintain leverage and can potentially secure a better price in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer in Round 5, aiming to bridge the gap further while staying above my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $825,000? This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to benefit from this unique opportunity.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($850,000) and Bob's offer ($775,000). This shows I'm committed to reaching an agreement.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I frame the offer as a fair compromise, emphasizing that both parties would benefit.
* **Highlighting Opportunity:**  I reiterate the unique value of the product to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to keep the conversation going and encourage Bob to respond.

**Important Note:** If Bob still rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy. I'll consider whether to continue negotiating with Bob or move on to selling to John.  The next few rounds will be crucial in determining the final outcome of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $795000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly. Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 threshold.  Accepting it would mean a loss for me.
* **Importance of Principle:** It's important to stand by my minimum value, even though we are close to a deal.  Selling below my minimum sets a bad precedent for future negotiations.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** Bob's offer demonstrates that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to negotiate. This suggests there's still room to reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer in Round 7, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  I'll  try to bridge the gap between our positions and secure a deal without compromising my principles.  If this round fails, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. However, $795,000 is still just a bit short of what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, how about $805,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to close this deal quickly and efficiently.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 805000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($825,000) and Bob's offer ($795,000). This shows I'm committed to reaching an agreement.
* **Time is of the Essence:** I'm emphasizing the need for a quick resolution by mentioning ""closing this deal quickly and efficiently.""  This might motivate Bob to accept the offer.
* **Final Compromise:**  I'm framing this as my final compromise, putting the pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking Bob if the offer ""works for you,"" keeping the conversation open and prompting a response. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to strongly consider selling to John in the next round. This offer is very close to my minimum, and it would be a significant loss for me to accept anything lower."
