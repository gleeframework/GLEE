,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly over my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can only offer $600000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is simply too low for this product.  I understand your budget constraints, but this is a unique opportunity you won't find elsewhere. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $850000.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $775000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $825000? This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to benefit from this unique opportunity.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $795000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly. Let me know if you're open to this.",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. However, $795000 is still just a bit short of what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, how about $805000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to close this deal quickly and efficiently.  Let me know if this works for you.",805000.0,Alice,7,
