Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire something of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While Bob values the product at $10,000, I know John will buy it for $15,000.  Therefore, I want to start by aiming for a price higher than $15,000 to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $19,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as a unique opportunity, which might make Bob more inclined to pay a premium. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If Bob is very cautious with his money, a high initial offer might discourage him. 
* **Relationship Building:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive initial offer might be more suitable. 

This initial offer is a starting point.  I'm prepared to adjust my approach based on Bob's response."
