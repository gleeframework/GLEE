# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. It's way above your budget of $800,000. You can counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still too high. You can counteroffer again and try to get a lower price."
