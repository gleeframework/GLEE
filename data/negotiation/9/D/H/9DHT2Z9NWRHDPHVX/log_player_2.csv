"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While it does seem like a great opportunity, my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate may not be worthwhile as it could risk losing the deal altogether. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product for a price slightly above his budget, but avoids the risk of losing the deal and having to purchase from John at a higher price."
