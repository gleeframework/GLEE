"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to offer $1000000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1250000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $1375000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
