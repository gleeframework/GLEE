Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with it. I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Confident Language:**  Using language that emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential satisfaction can make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation, increasing your chances of finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, he might be willing to pay slightly more.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob might reject a high offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, it's worth testing the waters for a higher profit."
