"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum desired price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm coming down to $10,500, which is still higher than Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This price is closer to his offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth to me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,500, so my counteroffer is $10,000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher offer.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  I really want to make this deal work, so let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,000.  It's still below my desired minimum, but this shows I'm committed to negotiating and finding a solution that works for both of us.  I hope this offer is appealing enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, so my counteroffer is $10,500. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting increasingly difficult and time-consuming.  While $10,500 is a decent price, it's still not close enough to my minimum desired price of $15,000.  With John offering a guaranteed $15,000, it's more advantageous for me to stop negotiating with Bob and accept John's offer.  This will ensure I get the maximum value for my product without further delay or risk."
