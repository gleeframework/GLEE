"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This is a bold opening move, aiming to establish a high starting point for negotiations.  I'm confident he'll counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a lot better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still maintaining a significant margin. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also conveying my firm stance on the product's value. I'm confident Bob will see this as a fair counteroffer and we can work towards a final agreement."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can achieve a better price with continued negotiation. I'm not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, demonstrating flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiation stance. I'm confident this offer will be attractive to Bob, and we can finally reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can achieve a better price with continued negotiation. I'm not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better price than what John is offering. While $1,400,000 is close, I'm not willing to risk losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. It's time to secure the deal with the guaranteed buyer."
