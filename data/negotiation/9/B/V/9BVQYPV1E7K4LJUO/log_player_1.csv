{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product has a firm value floor for both Alice and Bob ($1,500,000), Alice can afford to start with a high offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value"" and ""business acumen,"" Alice subtly appeals to Bob's potential desire for a good deal and savvy investment. 
* **Fallback Option:** Alice is secure knowing John provides a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 if Bob declines. This safety net allows for bolder negotiation tactics.

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy assumes Alice has no urgent need to sell quickly. A faster sale might require a price closer to the $1,500,000 mark.
* Negotiation is a two-way street. Bob's response will heavily influence Alice's next move."
