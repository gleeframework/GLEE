"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $11,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
