"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product far exceeds $500,000. Let's meet closer to the middle - I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value in this product.  To show you I'm serious about finding an agreeable outcome, I'll come down to $1,000,000 even.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
