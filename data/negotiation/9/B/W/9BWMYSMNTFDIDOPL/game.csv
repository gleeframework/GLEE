"Hello Bob, it's great to be connecting with you about this fantastic product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the value we both understand this product holds.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront.  While I want to find a solution that works for both of us,  $850,000 is simply too far below market value for me to accept.  I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
