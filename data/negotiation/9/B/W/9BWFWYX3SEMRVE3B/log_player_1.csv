"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product's value (without revealing my minimum price) may make Bob more willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial valuation. 
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000?  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counter-offering at $16,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and encourages continued negotiation.
* **Highlighting the deal:**  I'm emphasizing that $16,000 is still a good deal for both of us, aiming to persuade Bob to accept.
* **Moving forward:**  I'm explicitly stating my desire to move forward with the deal, hoping to motivate Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** Bob is demonstrating his willingness to pay more, suggesting there's room for improvement. 
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, I believe there's a good chance I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have a budget, and $14,000 is a good offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making this my final offer to Bob, as it's my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I emphasize that $15,000 is fair for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting we can finalize the deal if he accepts, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk is that Bob might walk away, forcing me to sell to John.  $15,000 is a good price, and I'm willing to take that risk to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are slim.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't lose out on a potential deal.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might walk away, leaving me with nothing. It's better to take the guaranteed profit now."
