"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has the potential to be incredibly lucrative, and I'm confident in its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000. How about we try $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,275,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher return on this unique product. Would you consider $1,310,000? I'm confident this price reflects its true value and potential.",1310000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,310,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $1,290,000? I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still willing to negotiate.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
