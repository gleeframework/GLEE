Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000. How about we try $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,275,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher return on this unique product. Would you consider $1,310,000? I'm confident this price reflects its true value and potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,310,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $1,290,000? I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
At this point, Bob's offer is getting reasonably close to my desired outcome. Accepting $1,290,000 ensures a significant profit, and continuing to push for a slightly higher price might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a good point to accept and close the deal."
