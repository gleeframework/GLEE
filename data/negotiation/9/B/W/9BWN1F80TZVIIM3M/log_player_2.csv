"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above your budget of $12,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit of $12,000.  Since John is offering the product for your maximum price, it's the most sensible option to buy from him and avoid further negotiations."
