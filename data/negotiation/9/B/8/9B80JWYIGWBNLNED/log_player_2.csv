It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a fair price for Bob.  It's within his budget and a better deal than buying from John."
