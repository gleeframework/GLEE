"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than John's offer. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, that price is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic aims to:
    * Gauge Alice's flexibility.
    * Potentially secure a deal much closer to my ideal price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $6,500 is a substantial decrease, it leaves ample room for negotiation. I expect Alice to counter, and I'm prepared to gradually increase my offer if needed.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping John's offer of $8,000 in mind as a backup plan if negotiations with Alice don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $6,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my bottom line. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as both options will now result in the same price of $8,000."
