"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That way, we can both be happy with the outcome.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
