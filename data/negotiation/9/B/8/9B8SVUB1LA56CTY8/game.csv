"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,300,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
