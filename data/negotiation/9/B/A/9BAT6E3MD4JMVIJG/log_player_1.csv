Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **Higher than Bob's value:** $11,000 is higher than Bob's value of $8,000, making it a potential win for me.
* **Lower than John's value:** $11,000 is lower than John's value of $12,000, ensuring I still make a profit if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit."
