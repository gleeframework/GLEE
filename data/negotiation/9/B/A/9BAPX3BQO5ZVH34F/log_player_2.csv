"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering!  That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still within a reasonable range for negotiation. It also leaves room to increase the offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down in price, $140 is still significantly more than you're willing to pay. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate her down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between your current offer and Alice's price.  It demonstrates willingness to negotiate while remaining within a reasonable range of your $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still significantly over your budget.  While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll reach a price you're comfortable with. It's time to cut your losses and go with your guaranteed option of buying from John for $80."
