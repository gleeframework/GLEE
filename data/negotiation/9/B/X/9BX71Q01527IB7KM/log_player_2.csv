"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly unique and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1200000, which I think reflects its worth. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but your asking price is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is a fair price given my needs. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the value of this unique product.  I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1000000. This is a significant concession, but it's the lowest I can go while still feeling comfortable with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get closer to his target price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $850,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still unable to accept a price below $950000. This product is truly exceptional and I'm confident it will be worth significantly more for your business.  Let's find a middle ground. This is my final concession before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Even though Alice has indicated this is her final offer, it's worth trying one more time to negotiate a lower price.  If that fails, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is my absolute final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $900000 is still not enough for me. This product's value to your business is significant, and I'm confident it will deliver more than expected. I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $925000. This is my final offer before I seriously consider other options. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's preferred price point.  With only three rounds left, the negotiation is likely to continue in this range.  Since Bob can get the product for a lower price from John, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
