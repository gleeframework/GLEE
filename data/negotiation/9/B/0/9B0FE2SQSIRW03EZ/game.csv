"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is far too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,000,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
