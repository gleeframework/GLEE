"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $100. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $95 for it. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While $95 is still a good price, I'm confident I can get a better deal with further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also reiterating my willingness to negotiate, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $98 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $98 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. It's possible that Bob might be willing to go up to $100, which is what John is offering. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm very close to accepting, but $98 is still a bit below what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise price of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and also John's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept, avoiding the need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I am willing to pay $97 for the product. This price aligns better with my budget while still offering a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where it's getting increasingly difficult to get a better price from Bob. He's only offering $97, which is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming time-consuming and uncertain. 

John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a certain outcome, it's best to sell the product to John."
