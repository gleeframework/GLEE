"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer and engage in a potentially productive negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The initial offer leaves space for both of us to come to a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob. I want to explore if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourages him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $1,600,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Clear Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (value of the product) to make it more persuasive. 
* **Positive Tone:** A positive tone helps keep the negotiation friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,400,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still not quite there. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  I have 6 rounds left. It's worth pushing for a little more. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer again shows that I'm determined to get my desired price. This could lead to a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  Your offer is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm lowering my price by a small amount, showing flexibility and a desire to close the deal. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer ($1,600,000) and Bob's last offer ($1,400,000).
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the price as fair and beneficial for both of us. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **Urgency:**  Although it's only Round 5, I'm starting to emphasize finding a solution that works for both of us, subtly suggesting that time is of the essence."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $1,425,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** With only 4 rounds left, there's a significant risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement that meets my minimum price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  I've already spent several rounds negotiating with Bob. Selling to John now ensures I get my desired price and avoids further potential delays or concessions.

**Conclusion:** It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
