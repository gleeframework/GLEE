,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $160. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $170. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $165. How about we say $172? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",172.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $175 is the best price for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $170. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",170.0,Bob,8,

"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $176. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",176.0,Bob,10,
