"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** We start with a confident opening message highlighting the product's value.
* **Ambitious but realistic:** The initial offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and our minimum, leaving room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This first offer serves to gauge Bob's interest and negotiation style. His response will inform our strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his valuation, leaving us no room for profit. We know we have a guaranteed offer from John that meets our minimum. However, there's still potential to negotiate a better deal with Bob. By rejecting and counter-offering, we signal that we're looking for a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,400,000. This takes into account the product's unique benefits and future potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge, but stand firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate that it's too low. 
* **Significant reduction, but above the minimum:** We decrease our price by $200,000, showing a willingness to negotiate while staying well above our $1,200,000 minimum and John's guaranteed offer.
* **Re-emphasize value:**  We remind Bob of the product's long-term value, subtly justifying the higher price.

We are strategically moving towards a price that is significantly profitable while still giving Bob the opportunity to feel like he is negotiating a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive signs but not enough:** Bob's willingness to increase his offer is a good sign, but $1,100,000 is still too close to John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate further.
* **Maintain a strong position:** Accepting now might make Bob think we'd have settled for even less. Continuing the negotiation keeps the pressure on him to meet us closer to our desired price point.
* **Time as a factor:**  We still have several rounds to go. There's a chance we can push Bob higher, but we need to be aware of the time constraint and John's standing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects my desire to close this deal while ensuring a fair valuation for this unique product."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and encourage:**  We acknowledge Bob's increased offer to encourage further movement. 
* **Strategic reduction:** We decrease our price by another $100,000, showing flexibility while aiming for a price point that's comfortably above our minimum.
* **Sense of urgency:**  By framing this as a final compromise and highlighting the ""fair valuation,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still struggling to justify $1,300,000. How about $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make this purchase. Let's try to reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching offer:** Bob's offer now matches John's guaranteed offer.
* **Minimal gains left:** While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time and certainty:** Accepting now ensures a favorable deal without the uncertainty of further negotiation. We secure the sale at our minimum acceptable price. 

By accepting, we achieve a successful outcome without risking the loss of a sale that meets our valuation."
