"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject and start the negotiation process by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,400,000. This takes into account the product's unique benefits and future potential for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,400,000, which is still outside of my comfortable range. It is worth negotiating further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects my desire to close this deal while ensuring a fair valuation for this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. It is worth continuing the negotiation, as there is still potential for a mutually agreeable price.  I can likely get the price down further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still struggling to justify $1,300,000. How about $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make this purchase. Let's try to reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
