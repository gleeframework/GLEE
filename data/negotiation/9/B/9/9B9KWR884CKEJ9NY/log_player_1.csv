Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet even $1,500,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,400,000.

Bob is unlikely to go above $1,400,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most logical choice at this point to secure a guaranteed profit."
