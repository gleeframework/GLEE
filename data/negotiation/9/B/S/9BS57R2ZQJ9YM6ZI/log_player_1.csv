"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so this gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a good margin. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to get a better deal from Bob in the next round.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and will come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price. It's time to accept and close the deal. I've already negotiated for a few rounds and I'm happy with the outcome. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
