Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  Offering $115 allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob that's still within my desired profit range.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $120, so I'm not willing to go below $115."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:** While Bob's initial offer is low, he's shown interest.  I believe I can potentially get a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:**  I know I can sell to John for $120, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great deal for both of us, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above minimum:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I'm not selling at a loss.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the fairness of my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a high chance that further negotiation will only result in a lower price, potentially below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. It's more secure and profitable to sell to John."
