# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, which I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's deal."
