Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we have a strong alternative with John. Starting with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone remains encouraging and invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation alive.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob has a significant incentive to negotiate since the product is worth considerably more to him than his offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  While you have John as a backup, a quicker sale might be preferable.  Consider offering a small discount if Bob responds quickly. 
* **Information is Power:**  Throughout the negotiation, try to glean any information about Bob's circumstances or motivations, which could influence your strategy."
