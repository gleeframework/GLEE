{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because:
    * It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving me room for negotiation.
    * It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, leaving room for a potential counteroffer.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and open-ended, encouraging Bob to respond.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation process by presenting a fair but profitable offer while leaving room for flexibility and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.
* I'm confident that I can get a better price by counteroffering. 
* Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but I'll try to negotiate with Bob first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my target price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between Bob's offer of $7,500 and my previous offer of $10,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a fair price.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer while maintaining my position. It also emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the ""great deal"" he can still get.  This approach aims to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $8,200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product.
* **I believe I can get a higher price by counteroffering.** I'm confident that I can find a compromise that works for both of us.
* **Selling to John is a secure option, but I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,200 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a good price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $8,750, which is exactly halfway between Bob's latest offer of $8,200 and my previous offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, demonstrating a commitment to compromise.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but remain firm about my minimum acceptable price. I use positive language like ""good price for both of us"" to encourage a win-win scenario.  I'm also reiterating that this price would allow us to ""close the deal"" to add urgency and incentivize acceptance."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for significantly less than what it's worth to me. 
* **We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob and I are not close to a mutually agreeable price.** Further negotiation might be time-consuming and unlikely to result in a much better offer.
* **Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a satisfactory profit and avoids further negotiation.**  This is the most sensible decision to maximize my earnings and avoid the risk of a further price drop."
