"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll recognize the benefit of paying a bit more to secure it.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a sweet spot at $1,012,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",1012500.0,Bob,4,
