``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about selling but also open to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 137} 
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway but still hold onto some of my profit margin. I'm showing flexibility, but also making it clear that I'm not willing to sell for much less than my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $132 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $134.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 134}
```

I'm offering a price that's just above Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my ideal price point. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my bargaining power."

Round 6

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and it's getting close to my minimum.  It's also important to consider that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and there's a chance that we won't be able to reach a deal. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale and make a profit."
