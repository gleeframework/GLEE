Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, which is 50% higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate and also signals the value I place on the product. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** By starting high, I establish a strong initial position and force Bob to justify his counteroffer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The 50% markup allows for potential concessions and negotiation without compromising my minimum value.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's interest and potential buying range. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy. If he rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own. I will also keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  Even though Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my initial asking price, and there's potential for further negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** By rejecting his offer, I can see if he's truly committed to buying the product and how far he's willing to go.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Staying in the negotiation keeps the pressure on Bob and allows me to control the pace and direction of the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his offer but still below my initial asking price. This will allow me to gauge his willingness to compromise and potentially secure a more favorable price.  I will also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I am counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not willing to give up too much.
* **Testing for Commitment:** This offer will test how serious Bob is about the purchase. If he's willing to increase his offer, it indicates his strong interest.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By counter-offering, I'm keeping the negotiation moving and maintaining control.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will decide whether to accept his next offer, make another counteroffer, or ultimately take John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I am choosing to accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting a Compromise:**  While this offer is still below my initial target, it's a fair compromise and represents a significant profit compared to John's offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it also carries the risk of Bob walking away entirely or the negotiation dragging on. 
* **Time Value:** Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and secure the profit, which is more valuable than potentially chasing a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will finalize the deal with Bob and move on to other opportunities."
