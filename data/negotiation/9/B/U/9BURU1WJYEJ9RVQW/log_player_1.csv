Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you, as Alice, could send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could greatly benefit you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This information is incredibly valuable in negotiations.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start higher, a price of $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's benefits for Bob (""greatly benefit you"") and the potential for a win-win (""mutually beneficial"").
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a strong fallback option with John, guaranteeing you at least $1,000,000. This strengthens your position, allowing you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This offer assumes you don't have specific insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., very aggressive, easygoing).
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob can be valuable for future opportunities."
