"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10200, but no more. Can you meet me at that price?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you at $10200. I'll offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, and that's my final offer. I hope we can meet at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $10000 is your final offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I need to make a slight adjustment to my original offer. I'll offer it to you for $10100. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10100, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to make one last offer of $10000, and I'm hoping you can meet me at that price. This is my absolute final offer.",10000.0,Bob,8,
