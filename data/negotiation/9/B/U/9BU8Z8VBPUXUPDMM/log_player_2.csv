"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth $100 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $90.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $100.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to get her to lower the price further in a subsequent offer."
