"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $850000 at this time. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your offer, but $850000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price is still fair for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am unable to meet the price of $900000. I would like to propose an offer of $875000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",875000.0,Bob,4,
