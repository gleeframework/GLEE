,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value of $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm reducing my price to $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $9,250. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to pay $8,800 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the last offer I'll make.",9000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the time and effort we're putting into this negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $9,050, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9050.0,Alice,9,
