"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $9,500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value of $8,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm reducing my price to $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:**  Instead of a large jump, this offer is a smaller increase from the previous one, showing your willingness to negotiate reasonably.

* **You have time and a backup:**  You have 3 rounds left and can continue negotiating, knowing you can buy from John if you need to.
* **Alice is showing flexibility:** Her willingness to make another concession suggests there's still room for a better deal.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the time and effort we're putting into this negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $9,050, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** While $9,050 is still slightly higher than your desired price, it's getting very close to your limit.
* **Limited time and potential loss:**  You only have one round left, and if you reject this offer, you risk either losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Alice's finality:** Alice is clearly indicating that this is her final offer, and rejecting it could lead to a breakdown in negotiations. 

**Strategy:** At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice. You've successfully negotiated a lower price, and further negotiation could lead to a worse outcome."
