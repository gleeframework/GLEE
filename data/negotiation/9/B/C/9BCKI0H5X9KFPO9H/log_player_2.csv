"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to come down closer to her own valuation of $800,000, potentially saving you even more money."
