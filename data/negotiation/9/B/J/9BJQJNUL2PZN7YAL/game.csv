"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $15500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $17000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $16750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16750.0,Alice,5,
