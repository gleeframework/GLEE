{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $16500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point.  Bob can try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to drop her price closer to his target of $15,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $15,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $17000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $16750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down slightly, her final offer is still above Bob's desired price point. Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $15,000, it's more beneficial to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
