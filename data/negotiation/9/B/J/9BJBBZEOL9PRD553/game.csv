"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500?  That's still a great price for a product worth much more, and it's a good middle ground for us both. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,750 is still below what I can accept. Let's compromise - I'm willing to go down to $8,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this. $8,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for that $8,000 mark.  Would you be willing to settle at $8,000 even?  It would help me out significantly and avoid me having to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
