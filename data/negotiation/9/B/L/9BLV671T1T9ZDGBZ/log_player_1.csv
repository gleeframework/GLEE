Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,500,000.  This is a fair price, considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product at the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000). This ensures I maximize my profit while still being appealing to Bob.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message simple and direct, highlighting the value to Bob and encouraging a response.  

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Guarantees Minimum Profit:**  Even if Bob rejects, I still get my minimum desired value from John.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts, I get the full value of the product.
* **Low Risk:**  I'm not taking a big risk by offering a price I'm comfortable with."
