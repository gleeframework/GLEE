"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I have 8 rounds remaining, and there's still room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're not willing to go as low as $850,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $875,000 is still below my desired range.  I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can get a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John for $800,000 yet, as I believe a higher price is achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your perspective, $875,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product for $887,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 887500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I have only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, accepting this offer ensures I secure a good price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
