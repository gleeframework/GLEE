"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is way over his budget and he can get a better deal elsewhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I think you'll discover with use. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he should keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? That's a significant price drop on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. It's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? I'm trying to be fair and get this excellent product into your hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  He's been negotiating for a while and he's only $3,750 away from John's price.  There's no guarantee that he can negotiate any lower with Alice, and he's risking running out of time."
