"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I think you'll discover with use. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? That's a significant price drop on my end.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? I'm trying to be fair and get this excellent product into your hands.",11750.0,Alice,7,
