"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in.  This price reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market value.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm offering $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price above $800,000, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $800,000. Let's compromise at $775,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me.  How about $750,000? This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there.  I'm willing to come down to $760,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's make this happen.",760000.0,Alice,7,
