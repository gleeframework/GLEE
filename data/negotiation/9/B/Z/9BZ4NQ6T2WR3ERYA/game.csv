"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,200,000. We appreciate your interest in the product, but we're not quite willing to meet you at that price. We're willing to meet you halfway, so we're counteroffering at $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and we believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a game-changing asset.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
