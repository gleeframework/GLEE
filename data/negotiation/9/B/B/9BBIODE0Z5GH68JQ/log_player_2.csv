"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's always the possibility of getting it for less. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's no guarantee of success, but it's worth trying to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $800,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $900,000, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal.  This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer. Accepting her offer at $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a significant saving compared to the original price of $900,000 and a much better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000."
