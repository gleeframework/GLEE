Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to offer it at the discounted price of $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 is appealing to Bob because it's significantly less than his perceived value of $8,000. It creates a sense of urgency and a ""good deal"" feeling.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $9,500, there might be a slight wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, ensuring Alice still gets a price above her minimum."
