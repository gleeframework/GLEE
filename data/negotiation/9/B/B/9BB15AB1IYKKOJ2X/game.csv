"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. How about $1,000,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm open to negotiating further, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the true value of the product. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $980,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
