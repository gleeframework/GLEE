Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still unable to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose $875,000 as a potential compromise. I hope this suggestion is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

```
At this point, Bob is offering $875,000. While I could try to push for a bit more, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further extended negotiations.
