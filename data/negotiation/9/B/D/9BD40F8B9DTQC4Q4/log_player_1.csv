""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible since she has a guaranteed buyer. 
* **Entice Bob:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($10,000) might entice him to buy. A price of $14,999 is a significant markup for Alice while still potentially appearing like a ""deal"" to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (optional):** While this strategy aims for a quick sale, Alice could leave some room for Bob to counter-offer. However, since she has a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, extensive negotiation might not be necessary."
