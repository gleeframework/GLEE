"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $70?  That seems like a fair price that would work for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $78. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it!",78.0,Alice,5,
