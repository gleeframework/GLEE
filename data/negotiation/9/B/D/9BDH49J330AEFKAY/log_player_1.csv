Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $11,999 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing Alice above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob immediately avoids the potential delay of dealing with John, even if John offers a slightly higher price. 

This strategy aims to secure a quick and highly profitable sale."
