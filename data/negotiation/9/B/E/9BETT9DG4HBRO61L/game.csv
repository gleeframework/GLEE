"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring the price down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I believe the product is valuable, $11,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? That's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll meet you at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $10,000.  Would you be open to $9,750? It's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'll meet you at $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
