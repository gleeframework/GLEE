"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $13,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $12,250. This reflects a more realistic compromise given the value this product offers.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,250 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $11,500?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your desire to find a fair price.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $11,800.  This feels like a strong compromise that recognizes the product's value while making it attainable for you.",11800.0,Alice,5,
