Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price. Are you interested in buying it for $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering it at $115 still guarantees me a profit above my minimum ($100) even if Bob declines and I have to sell to John."
