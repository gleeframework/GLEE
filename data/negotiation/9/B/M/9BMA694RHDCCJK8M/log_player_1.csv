"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it will be a huge asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a strong offer that leans towards your ideal outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering it at $1,100,000 leaves a buffer for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good chunk of money, it's still significantly less than what Bob is willing to pay and what I value the product at.  It's worth at least one more counter-offer to see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value while still providing you a good deal."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** Acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to negotiate helps maintain a positive tone. However, the message firmly reiterates that the previous offer was too low. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $1,025,000 as a compromise aims to find a point where both parties feel like they're getting a reasonable deal.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Subtly reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces the justification for the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it feels like he has more room to move.  He's gone up $50,000, but I've come down $100,000 already. I'll push a bit further, as there are still rounds left in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a price of $975,000, but that's my absolute best offer. This represents a significant discount for a product that will bring you so much value."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer makes it clear that I'm reaching my limit, while still offering a compromise. 
* **Finality:** Presenting this as my ""best offer"" introduces a sense of urgency and finality to encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Value Emphasis:** Again, highlighting the product's value to Bob reinforces why it's worth the proposed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is getting smaller and riskier. 
* **Strong Profit:** $925,000 is a significant profit margin. It's crucial to recognize a good deal when it's on the table.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation means tying up the product longer. Accepting now allows me to move on to other opportunities. 
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's offer increments suggest he may be nearing his maximum price.  It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in subsequent rounds."
