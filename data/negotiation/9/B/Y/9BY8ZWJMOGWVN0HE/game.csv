"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your offer, however,  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  $14,000 is cutting it close, but I could be persuaded to accept $15,500.  This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
