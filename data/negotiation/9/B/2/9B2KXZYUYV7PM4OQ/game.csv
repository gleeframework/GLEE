"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can find a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain from it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
