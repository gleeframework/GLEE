"Hi Alice, $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high for you, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I can let it go for $140.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still more than I can afford. I'm sticking to my original offer of $80.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I want to be fair and find a solution that works for both of us. You're right that $140 is still significantly higher than your offer. How about we try $120? This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",120.0,Alice,5,
