Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This keeps the deal within your desired range. 
* **A clear and concise message:** This sets the tone for the negotiation.

By setting the price at $11,500, you are leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring that you earn a profit. If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your next offer based on his counteroffer, while always keeping in mind your minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John for $12,000."
