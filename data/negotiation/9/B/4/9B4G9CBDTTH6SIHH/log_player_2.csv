Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you the product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. Could you consider something closer to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'll meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation: While Alice is coming down on price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $10,500. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is your ideal price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice and risking a higher final price."
