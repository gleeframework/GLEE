"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you the product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. Could you consider something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'll meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
