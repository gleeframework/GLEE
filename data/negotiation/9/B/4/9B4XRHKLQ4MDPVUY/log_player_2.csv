"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1450000. It's a great deal, as you know the value is even higher for you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price.  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's a range where both parties can benefit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1400000.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1375000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and still within Bob's budget, allowing him to save money.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and the potential of having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few more rounds of negotiation."
