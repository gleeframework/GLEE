"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** I'm asking Bob for his opinion, indicating I'm open to a conversation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and inviting Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's not ideal. I have 10 rounds and there's potential for a better deal. 

* **Counter-offering:** I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give in immediately.
* **Keeping options open:**  By rejecting, I keep open the possibility of a higher price or the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Middle ground:** I'm proposing $90, which is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This makes it a more attractive option for both of us.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept a higher price. 
* **Positive framing:** Using phrases like ""good deal"" and ""middle ground"" keeps the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my budget. Can we meet at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation progress:** Bob has moved closer to my desired price.  We're now only $5 apart.
* **Time factor:**  We're already in Round 4, and each round reduces my negotiating power.
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John for $80 is a secure option, but accepting Bob's offer of $85 nets me a slightly higher profit.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even if Bob rejects further offers, accepting his $85 offer keeps the door open for future business with him. He might be more willing to pay my asking price in the future, knowing I'm willing to negotiate. 

While I'd like more, accepting Bob's offer balances the risk of not getting a better offer with the potential of securing a slightly better price now."
