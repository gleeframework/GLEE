"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential returns. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the price you're offering is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. It represents a substantial investment on my part, and I need to see a return that aligns with its potential.  How about we settle at $1,800,000? This still offers you a great deal and reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
