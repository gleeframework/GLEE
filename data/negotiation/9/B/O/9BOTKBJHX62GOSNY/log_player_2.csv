"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate and get a better price.  Since you have a fallback option with John, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and $8,750 is still a good deal compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting the offer."
