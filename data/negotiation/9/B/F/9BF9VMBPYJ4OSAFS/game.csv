"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for this incredible product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. That said, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $925,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make some concessions. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $1,050,000, which would put us at $987,500. What do you think?",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to meet you closer to your price. How about $950,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about closing this deal. However, I still think the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $975,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
