Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for this incredible product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make some concessions. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $925,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about closing this deal. However, I still think the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $975,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

It's getting close to the wire, and Alice seems firm on her price.  While we could try to negotiate further, $975,000 is a reasonable price and saves a significant amount compared to John's offer.  It's better to accept a good deal now than risk losing it."
