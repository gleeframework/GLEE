"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get an even better price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go at this point."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $13,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's within Bob's budget and saves him $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or getting stuck at a higher price is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
