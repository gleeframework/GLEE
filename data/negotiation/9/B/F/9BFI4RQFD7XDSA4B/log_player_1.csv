Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential agreement zone between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but leave some room for negotiation to make Bob feel like he's getting a slight deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message highlights the product's ""exclusive"" and ""unique"" nature to justify the high price.
* **High Anchor:** $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** You signal flexibility and willingness to have a conversation, which can encourage Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. You could start with an even higher price if you anticipate Bob might try to negotiate you down significantly. However, be prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to come close to your minimum. You have a strong alternative with John."
