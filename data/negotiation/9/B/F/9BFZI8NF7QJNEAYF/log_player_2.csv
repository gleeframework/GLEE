"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it would be worth $950000. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,200,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good value for you considering your asking price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to consider a middle ground. My counteroffer for the product is $900000. This still reflects the value of the product to me, while also accommodating your financial situation. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it is still above his maximum of $800,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to lower the price further.  He can also consider the potential of getting a better deal from John if the negotiations with Alice continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still out of my range. Given the value of the product to you, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at $875,000.  This allows you a significant profit while staying within my budget.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've carefully considered your latest proposal, and I'm glad to hear that we're closing the gap. My counteroffer for the product is $890000. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for me while being more accessible to your budget. I believe this could be a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $890,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $90,000 above his desired price. There is still room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if Alice will go lower.  Bob can also use the threat of going to John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close.  I understand your need for a profit, but $890,000 is still stretching my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $860,000, which is a significant improvement from my last offer and a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal now, as I'm concerned I may have to pursue other options if we don't reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a common ground, Bob. After careful consideration, I propose a final offer of $880000 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product to you while allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is the best possible outcome for both parties, and I hope we can move forward with this agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $880,000 is still $80,000 over Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $800,000, as it guarantees he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
