"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,000? I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a competitive price.  Could we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,500.** This is better than John's price of $15,000. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  Accepting the offer means getting the product for a lower price than John's.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly lower price.**  Alice already lowered her price once, and might not be willing to budge further.

While Bob could try for a lower price, accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at a price lower than John's, achieving his primary goal."
