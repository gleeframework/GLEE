"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price that considers both our perspectives.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 as a final compromise.  This is a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,
