Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob allows Alice to start high. The $1,150,000 offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Alice's minimum.
* **Justification for Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price without revealing the exact worth to him.
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** This offer assumes Bob might negotiate. If Alice suspects Bob is highly price-sensitive, she might lower the offer slightly.
* **Relationship Building:** Depending on the context and potential for future deals, Alice might prioritize a long-term relationship with Bob and offer a slightly more appealing price. 
 
This offer aims to maximize Alice's profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
