It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $750,000 is a decent starting point, but there's room for improvement.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

Let's start by making a significant counteroffer.  $600,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showing our seriousness in getting a good deal.  We'll see if Alice is willing to budge this early in the negotiation."

Alice is back to her original price, but we've shown a willingness to negotiate, and we're not quite ready to give up. We can still try to push for a lower price. Let's see if we can get her to come down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

We're approaching John's price, but Alice is showing a stubborn streak. Let's offer her a slightly higher price than our last counteroffer, but still lower than her current offer.  We'll see if this will entice her to finally accept."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not budging from her position and we're running out of time.  At this point, it's better to cut our losses and buy from John.  While it's not our ideal price, it's still a decent deal and avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially ending up with nothing."
