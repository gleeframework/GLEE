Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $1,000,000 is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Discount:** Offering a discount shows a willingness to negotiate and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  The $1,000,000 price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before I need to consider John's offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes that Bob is a serious buyer and that negotiation is possible. It's always important to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my ideal target. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Avoiding Compromise:**  Selling for $900,000 would mean leaving $300,000 on the table, which is a significant amount.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $950,000 is exactly halfway between my initial offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still above my minimum value ($1,200,000) and leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and positive, reinforcing the idea of a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is only $30,000 away from my initial offer of $950,000.  This is a relatively small difference.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I'd prefer a higher price, the potential for a lengthy negotiation with no guarantee of a better deal is too risky.  
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but I'd prefer to avoid that if possible, as it's a significant loss compared to Bob's offer.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale close to my target price, minimizing the risk of losing the deal and ensuring a quicker transaction."
