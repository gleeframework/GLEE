**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, the time constraint and the fact that her offer is already within your budget make it the best option."
