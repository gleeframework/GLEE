Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming high initially is key to maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly rather than overthink or shop around. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
