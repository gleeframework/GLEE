Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer matches John's, I'm still in the early stages of negotiation. There's room to convince Bob to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,500,000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. Could you consider $1,800,000? This reflects the true value and potential returns you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,700,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is moving closer to my desired price point, and I still have plenty of rounds to negotiate. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get him closer to $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,750,000? This reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go slightly lower and offer $1,725,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer at $1,725,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
