"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $90 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $75? That would be a great price for me.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $85, my final offer.  This is a great price for a product you'll love.",85.0,Alice,5,
