"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your initial assessment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. Can we meet at this price?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price and it aligns with John's offer. This ensures a quick sale and avoids any further negotiation."
