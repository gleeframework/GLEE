Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:** Offering a high price with a slight discount creates a sense of urgency. Bob might feel like he's getting a ""deal"" compared to an unknown future offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob negotiates, Alice can slightly reduce the price while still staying above her minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know the exact details of Bob's financial situation or how much he truly values the product beyond the $8,000 estimate."
