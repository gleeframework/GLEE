{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and encouraging, aiming to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a quick deal, but I'm prepared to negotiate. 
* I'm aware of John's offer as a backup plan, but I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible. 
* By starting with a relatively high offer, I'm setting the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, which will allow me to assess his interest and adjust my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer** shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that bridges the gap, potentially around $11,000. 
* I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm optimistic that I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,250** is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway while still achieving a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **The message** is positive and collaborative, highlighting the potential for a ""good deal"" for both of us. It aims to maintain a good rapport and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* By offering a compromise, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's a step towards a potential agreement.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll likely need to consider John's offer more seriously. However, I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $11250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe we can achieve a better price through continued negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer** demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to hold out for a higher price. 
* I'll counter with an offer slightly lower than my previous one, maybe $10,500. This signals that I'm open to compromise, but still maintain my ground.
* However, I am starting to consider John's offer more seriously as a viable alternative. If Bob continues to reject, I will likely have to choose between his offer and selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500** is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum.  It's only $500 away from Bob's last offer, making it a compelling option for him.
* **The message** is positive and emphasizes the fairness and mutual benefit of this offer. I'm reiterating that we're getting closer and trying to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* I'm taking a more aggressive stance, moving closer to Bob's offer but still trying to push for a better price.
* This counteroffer is a final attempt to get a price closer to my minimum while still being reasonable for Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can do better. How about we meet in the middle between $10000 and $10500? I'm willing to offer $10250

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm starting to feel frustrated with the back-and-forth negotiation. It's taking longer than expected, and I'm worried that we might not reach a mutually acceptable price. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, I've decided to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000.

**Strategy:**

* **Selling to John** ensures that I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation. This is a pragmatic choice given the time spent and the possibility that the negotiations could continue indefinitely.
* I am ultimately prioritizing the certainty of a good price over the potential for a slightly higher price with Bob, who may not be willing to meet my minimum. 
* This decision also allows me to move on to other potential deals without wasting more time."
