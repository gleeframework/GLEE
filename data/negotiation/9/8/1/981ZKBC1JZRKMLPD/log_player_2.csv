Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,250?  This would give you a great deal, and it's still within my range. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $13,800 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $14,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,900.  This is a fair price, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  Let's close this out and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate towards a price you find acceptable. $13,900 is a significant savings compared to her initial offer and keeps you well below your $15,000 maximum.  

While you could try to push for an even lower price, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to negotiate or that the difference in price won't be substantial enough to justify the risk of losing the deal."
