"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you value the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,250?  This would give you a great deal, and it's still within my range. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, splitting the difference does seem fair. How about we settle on $13,800? That's just a little closer to my budget.",13800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $13,800 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $14,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,900.  This is a fair price, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  Let's close this out and move forward.",13900.0,Alice,7,
