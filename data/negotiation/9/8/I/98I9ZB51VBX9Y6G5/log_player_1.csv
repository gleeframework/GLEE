Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you see the value in this product, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. It's time for a smaller counteroffer to keep him engaged while still aiming for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price that works for us both.  How about we settle at $985,000? That's a significant price reduction on my end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. How about $965,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly still negotiating and moving closer to our price. Accepting at $965,000 is a significant profit above our $800,000 minimum and a good deal overall. Holding out for more risks losing the deal entirely."
