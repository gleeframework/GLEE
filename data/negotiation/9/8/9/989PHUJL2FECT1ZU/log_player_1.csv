Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $115. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a quick and profitable sale.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $115 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a profit above my minimum ($100).
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum, I know Bob values the product at $120. There's still room for negotiation to secure a better price.  I'll counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find it a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims to find a compromise while still securing a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my initial asking price.
* **Conveying Fairness:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I aim to make the compromise seem more appealing and fair to Bob.
* **Maintaining Confidence:**  I reiterate my confidence in the product's value, subtly reinforcing the idea that my offer is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. I could go up to $108, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $108 is still a profitable price for me, exceeding my minimum sale price of $100.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to negotiate further, Bob has indicated that $108 is his limit. Continuing might risk losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now ensures a quick and certain sale, whereas further negotiation introduces uncertainty and potential delays."
