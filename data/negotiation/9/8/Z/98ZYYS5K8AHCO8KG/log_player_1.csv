Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it below this would be leaving money on the table.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high, but not ridiculously so, leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could start lower, hoping for a quick sale, or employ other negotiation tactics."
