"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is within Bob's budget, it's likely Bob can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $130 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Bob is making a significant counteroffer, immediately pushing for a lower price. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate and sets a strong starting point. 
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for the lower price (""too high for my budget"") making the counteroffer more persuasive.
* **Fair Offer:** While $100 is a big reduction, it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit ($20) and allows for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $100.  Would you consider $115? I'm trying to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for a better deal. 
* **Staying aggressive:** Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower the price. 
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John at $150 is less desirable than continuing to negotiate.  Bob is confident he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $115 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $105.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer but staying firm on a lower price. This demonstrates willingness to compromise without giving in completely.
* **Value Justification:**  Bob again emphasizes the product's value, reminding Alice of potential profit even at the lower price.
* **Clear Intent:** Bob is setting a clear price point, making it clear what he's willing to pay."
