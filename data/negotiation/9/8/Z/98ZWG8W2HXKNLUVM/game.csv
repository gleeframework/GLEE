"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1200000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $750000 is still below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and the market conditions. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my means. I'd like to offer $775000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $800000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market conditions. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your last offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to stick with my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm not willing to go any higher than this.",775000.0,Bob,6,
