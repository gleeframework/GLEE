Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  While I recognize the value of your product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""price"": 8500}"
