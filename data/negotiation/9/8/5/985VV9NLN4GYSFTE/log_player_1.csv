We're getting close, but we can still aim for a slightly better outcome. Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our desired range."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While we could continue pushing for a slightly higher amount, accepting $1,080,000 is a strong deal. We're securing a significant profit above our minimum, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether."
