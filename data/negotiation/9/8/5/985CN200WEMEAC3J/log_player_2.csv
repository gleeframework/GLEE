"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sell the product for a price much higher than its value to her ($11,000 vs. $8,000). While her offer is slightly below your maximum price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her initial offer might push her to lower the price closer to her own perceived value."
