"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial price is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've described.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
