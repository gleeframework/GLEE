# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but closer to your maximum. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your goal."
