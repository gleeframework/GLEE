"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me.  How about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway twice, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, as you suggested, but I still need to make a profit. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
