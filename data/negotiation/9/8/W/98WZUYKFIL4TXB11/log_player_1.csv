Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, I can't go as low as $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider $9,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. I'm only $250 away from my previous counteroffer, and I'm concerned about the potential of further negotiation rounds leading to a lower price or even a sale to John for $8,000.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing out on a better deal."
