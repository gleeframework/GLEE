"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $18,000? I'm motivated to find a solution, and I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
