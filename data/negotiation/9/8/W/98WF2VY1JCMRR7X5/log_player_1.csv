Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
