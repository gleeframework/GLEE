"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90. That's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $65 is quite a jump. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $75? It's a good deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you consider $85?  That would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make a reasonable profit.",85.0,Alice,5,
