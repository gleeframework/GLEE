"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90. That's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you consider $85?  That would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go down further than $85.  While getting the product for $5 less is ideal, it's better to secure the $80 price from John and avoid further back-and-forth negotiation."
