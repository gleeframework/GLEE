Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Saying ""I'm open to negotiating"" shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $100 is still above my minimum value of $120, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've made a good deal and can sell the product.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll be ready to consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his bid. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even below the value Bob himself perceives ($80). Accepting this would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. I can use this to my advantage by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer closer to my minimum price, aiming for a deal within my acceptable range. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers until we reach a mutually acceptable price or I decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90. That's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $100 to $90. This shows willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Still above minimum:** $90 is still well above my minimum price of $120, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Focusing on value:**  Mentioning the product's value emphasizes its worth and justifies the price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a satisfactory outcome and secured a deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $65 is quite a jump. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $75? It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's closer than before, it's not a good enough deal for me.
* **Continuing negotiations:**  Bob is showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **John is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $120, giving me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and try for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer somewhere between $75 and my minimum price of $120. 
* **If Bob accepts:** I'll sell the product and close the deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers or ultimately sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you consider $85?  That would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm inching closer to Bob's offer, but staying above my minimum. $85 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing it as a fair deal for both of us, highlighting the benefits of reaching an agreement.
* **Focus on profit:** Mentioning profit reminds Bob that I need to make money from the sale.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great, we have a deal!
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to evaluate his next offer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
