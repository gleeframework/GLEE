"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay more.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to accept, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $125. This shows him I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully will encourage him to make a better counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $120.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what John is willing to pay. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll just sell to John and be done with it."
