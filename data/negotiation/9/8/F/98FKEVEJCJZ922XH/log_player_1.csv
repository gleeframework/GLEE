Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be agreeable to Bob, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not willing to go lower, and I can get my minimum price from John.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
