Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the unique benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, which sets a solid baseline. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling closer to his valuation. 
* **Maximizing Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob could significantly increase your profit.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the higher price as justified. 
 
**Important Note:**  This strategy involves a calculated risk. If Bob is unwilling to negotiate above $1,200,000, you'll miss out on the potential extra profit. However, the potential reward for a successful negotiation is substantial."
