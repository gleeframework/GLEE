"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you, and it's closer to my initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
