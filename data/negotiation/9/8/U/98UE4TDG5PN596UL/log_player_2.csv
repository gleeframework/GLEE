"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice first.  You can always buy from John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you, and it's closer to my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is now at your limit for the product. It's a good deal for you, and you risk losing it if you keep negotiating."
