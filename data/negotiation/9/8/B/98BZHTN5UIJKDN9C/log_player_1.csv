Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a significant distance from my initial asking price.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle at $1,025,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below the product's value to me and even John's guaranteed offer. It's time to push back a bit harder while still showing willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has returned to his previous offer of $950,000 and declared it his final offer. This suggests he is unlikely to move significantly from this price point. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
