"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
