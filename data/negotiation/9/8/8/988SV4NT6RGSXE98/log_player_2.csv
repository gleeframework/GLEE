"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your value:** You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $140
* **John's offer:** $150

Since Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, but lower than John's price, you are better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
