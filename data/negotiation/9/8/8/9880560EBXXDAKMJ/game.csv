"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $110, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if that works for you!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
