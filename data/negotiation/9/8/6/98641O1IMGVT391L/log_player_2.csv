"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly below Alice's asking price but still above her perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and signals I'm serious about buying, but not at any cost.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps me gauge Alice's flexibility.  Her response will indicate how quickly we might reach a deal. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** I know I can get the product from John for $1,500,000, so I have a walk-away point if negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $950,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Negotiating:** Alice's willingness to move from $1,100,000 to $950,000 shows she's open to negotiation. There's still room to bargain.
* **Staying Firm (for now):**  A quick acceptance might leave money on the table. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a better deal. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer Coming:**  My next counteroffer will aim to bring the price closer to my target range while still being reasonable for Alice to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $900,000? That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Negotiation:** I'm staying engaged in the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Incremental Steps:** I've moved my offer up slightly to $900,000, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up significant ground too quickly. 
* **Testing the Water Again:** This offer aims to see if Alice is willing to go below $950,000 and, if so, by how much. It helps me gauge her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. Pushing further could make her walk away.
* **Good Price:**  $925,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Trying to negotiate a slightly lower price risks losing the deal entirely.  It's unlikely Alice will move much further, and it's not worth the risk of losing the product altogether."
