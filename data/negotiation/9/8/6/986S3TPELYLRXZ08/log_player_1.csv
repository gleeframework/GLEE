"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price and want to see if Bob is willing to budge.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to considering selling to John if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,750 and $8,900, which would be $8,825. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,825. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,825
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,825 is getting close to my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned about the risk of losing a deal and having to sell to John for less than I want. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
