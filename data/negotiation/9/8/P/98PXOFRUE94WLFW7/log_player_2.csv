"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I understand your perspective on the price. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will either become unwilling to negotiate further or that the price will climb again.  $1,100,000 is a good deal, saving Bob $400,000 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer is the best strategy in this situation."
