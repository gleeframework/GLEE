"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at a minimum of $800000 to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for the right buyer.  My initial offer is $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to pay up to that amount for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This offer is still significantly lower than what I believe this product is worth, but it shows my commitment to making this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the potential of this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price.  I'm willing to go down to $975000. This reflects my willingness to compromise, but I can't go any lower. It's important to remember that the product's potential value is far greater than this price. Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
