"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. While $9,750 is closer, it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  That's a good compromise, and it gives you a great deal on this valuable product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again between $9,000 and $10,250. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,625?",9625.0,Bob,6,
