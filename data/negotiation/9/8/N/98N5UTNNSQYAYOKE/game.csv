"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but $110 is too high for me.  I'll offer you $100 one last time.  If you can't accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,108.0
"I understand you're willing to pay $100, Bob, but I've already met you at that price in my previous offer. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to get at least $108 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",108.0,Alice,9,,
