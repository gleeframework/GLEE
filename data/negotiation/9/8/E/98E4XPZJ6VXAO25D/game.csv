"Alice, while I appreciate the value you place on this product, $1500000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in the potential benefits but would need to see the price closer to $1100000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1300000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within this limit. If this works for you, we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
