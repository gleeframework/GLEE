To meet somewhere in the middle, I am proposing an adjusted price of $875,000 for the product. This still allows for a significant profit while considering your feedback.

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $800,000? I believe that's a fair offer that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
