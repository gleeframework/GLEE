Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Bob's offer is lower than that. I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
