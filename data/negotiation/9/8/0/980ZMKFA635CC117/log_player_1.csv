Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice knows it's worth $10,000 to her worst-case scenario (selling to John).  Starting with a higher offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a better deal.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, Alice adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial high price gives Alice the flexibility to negotiate down if needed, while still staying above her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
