"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to make the price seem more reasonable. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit.**
* **Create a starting point for a good negotiation.**
* **Avoid immediately resorting to the fallback option with John.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product.  I can likely get closer to my target price with further negotiation.
* **Time to Counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  

**Note:** I'm still keeping John in mind as a fallback option, but I want to see if I can maximize my profit through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $9,200. This price still gives you a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still well above my minimum price. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm using language that suggests a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not immediately accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Explore a middle ground:** I believe a price of $9,200 is a reasonable compromise that could be acceptable to both parties.
* **Avoid selling to John:** I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob, but I still have John as a backup if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation still possible:** While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it indicates he's still interested. I believe we can still reach a more favorable price through further negotiation.
* **Avoid selling to John (for now):** I want to exhaust all avenues with Bob before resorting to John. 

**Note:** I'm considering the possibility of making a small concession in my next counteroffer, but I'm also aware that the remaining rounds are limited. If Bob continues to reject offers, I may have to seriously consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. How about $9,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value and my need to make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, dropping the price to $9,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm highlighting the price as ""fair"" to both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm suggesting we ""agree on this"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

This approach aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's desired price without sacrificing too much of my own profit margin.
* **Show commitment:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Pressure Bob:**  I'm subtly suggesting that $9,000 is the final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept.

While I'm still considering John as a backup, I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal with Bob.  The remaining rounds are limited, so I need to be strategic in my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $8,200 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  There is little chance of reaching an acceptable price with further negotiation.
* **Limited Time:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I'm running out of time to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum desired profit.

**Conclusion:** It's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price.  To avoid further delays and ensure I get a profitable outcome, I'm choosing to sell to John."
