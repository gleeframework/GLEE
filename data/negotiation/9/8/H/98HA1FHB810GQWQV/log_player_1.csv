Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this much for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial asking price of $200. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that still gives me a good profit while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's lower than I hoped for, it's still a good deal for me.  It's better than selling to John, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
