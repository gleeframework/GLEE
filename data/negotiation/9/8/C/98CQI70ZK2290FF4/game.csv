"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. It's a bit above my budget, and I'm not sure I can justify the cost. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $9,250? It's a fair price that benefits us both.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $9,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
