"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from its true value.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000.
