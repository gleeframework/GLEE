"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to go down to $140.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's close this deal!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $130 is the best price for this product. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it. Can you meet me at that price?,115.0,Bob,6,
