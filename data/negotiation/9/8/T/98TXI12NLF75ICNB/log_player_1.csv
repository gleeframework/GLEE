Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential benefits for you.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take $850,000, it's significantly less than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000) and far below the product's true value.  I'm not desperate for a sale and John is a guaranteed buyer at a much better price.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows me to try to push Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and reflects the value I believe you'll get from this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This demonstrates my genuine interest in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still too low. I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) to make this deal worthwhile.  Selling to John would guarantee me a significantly better return, and rejecting this offer gives me more leverage to push Bob toward a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too far from what this product is truly worth.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget constraints.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I am still better off rejecting the offer, continuing the negotiation, and trying to get a better deal.  If I don't get a better offer, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below what this product deserves.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value you will gain from this product while also meeting my needs. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
