"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and reflects the value I believe you'll get from this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This demonstrates my genuine interest in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm hoping we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too far from what this product is truly worth.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget constraints.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
