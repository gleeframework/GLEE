Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $70 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. But I'm still not willing to give up on getting a good price for the product. How about we try to get closer to the original price I had in mind? I'm willing to meet you at $82.50?

It's clear Alice is trying to get a price above her own valuation.  It's unlikely she'll go below $80, so it's better to take the guaranteed deal from John."
