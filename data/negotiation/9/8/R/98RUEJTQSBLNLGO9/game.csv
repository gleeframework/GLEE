"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be open to $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's split the difference, and I think we can make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
