"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product.  I know its value to you is considerable.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product is truly one-of-a-kind and its value is undeniable.  How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,300,000.  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a number we can both agree on. What if we settled on $1,400,000?  That reflects the true value of this product while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer. How about $1,350,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
