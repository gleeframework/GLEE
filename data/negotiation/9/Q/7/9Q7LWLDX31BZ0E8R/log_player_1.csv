Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate it, but I'm only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer of $150 is the maximum he's willing to pay.  Since I can sell it to John for the same price, there's no point in further negotiation. It's better to sell to John now and avoid potential delays or further haggling."
