"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price. 
* **Friendly opening:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to emphasize its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he has shown interest in the product.
* **Protecting my value:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss for me, and I'm not willing to accept that at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is too low.  How about $12,500? This is still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the deal:** I'm emphasizing that $12,500 is still a good deal for Bob, given his stated value of $15,000.
* **Maintaining profit:** This offer allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While $11,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the conversation.
* **Protecting value:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  This would still give you a great deal on a product you value highly."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that is directly in the middle of our current offers, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to encourage him to accept this offer.
* **Balancing profit and deal:**  $11,750 is a good compromise that allows me to make a profit while still offering a fair price to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for sticking with this. I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer. How about $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $11,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, the risk of further negotiation is high.
* **Risk of counteroffers:**  Bob has shown a pattern of low counteroffers, and there's a chance he won't budge further.  Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price than what I'm currently offered by John.
* **Time constraint:** We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation rounds.  It's prudent to secure a sale, as I might not be able to reach a better agreement with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John for $12,000 is the safest and most sensible option at this point. While I'd like to earn more, the potential for loss outweighs the possibility of a slightly higher price with Bob."
