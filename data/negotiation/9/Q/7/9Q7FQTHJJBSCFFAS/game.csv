"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is too low.  How about $12,500? This is still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  This would still give you a great deal on a product you value highly.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for sticking with this. I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer. How about $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,
