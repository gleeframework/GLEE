Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $100, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my target. How about we add a bit more to that, and I'll meet you at $130? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go down to $100.  You've set your maximum price and further haggling is just wasting time you could use to get the product from John."
