"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive and enthusiastic:** I'm using positive language to try and create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Direct and clear:** I'm being direct about the price and providing an easy way for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not ideal:**  While $9,500 is significantly better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Time to counter:** I'll counteroffer and see if I can close the deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm not going down to Bob's price, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us. This avoids coming across as overly aggressive.
* **Clear intent:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation but have a firm bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum:**  $10,000 is above my minimum desired price of $8,000.
* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and we're now close to a deal. 
* **Closing the deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal to John."
