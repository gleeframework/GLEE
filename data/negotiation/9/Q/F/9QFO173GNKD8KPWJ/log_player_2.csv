Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $8,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the product at the best price."
