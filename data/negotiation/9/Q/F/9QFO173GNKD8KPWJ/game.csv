"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we possibly settle on $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
