,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $900,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects a more accurate assessment of the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
