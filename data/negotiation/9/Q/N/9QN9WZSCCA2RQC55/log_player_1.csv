``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  Even at this price, I'm exceeding Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000) and securing a good profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment. Closing the deal now ensures I receive the funds and can potentially reinvest them.
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a risk that Bob might walk away, especially as we approach my fallback price with John. Accepting now avoids that risk."
