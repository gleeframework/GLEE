"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the asset has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this asset and its potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair offer considering the long-term value it represents.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
