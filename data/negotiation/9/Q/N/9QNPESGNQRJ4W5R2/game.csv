"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $8500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
