"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and meeting at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. How about we settle at $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,075,000. Can we find a middle ground at this price?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
