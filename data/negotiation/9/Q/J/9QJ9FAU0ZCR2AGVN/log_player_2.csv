Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $110?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. However, I've already taken a hit on the price. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Accepting the $105 offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
