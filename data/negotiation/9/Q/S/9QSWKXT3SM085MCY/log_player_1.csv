{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $150, we want to get as close to that as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. It's unlikely he'll counter with less than your $100 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $100 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price. 

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring the sale goes through."
