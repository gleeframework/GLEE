"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Would you be willing to compromise?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $97.50 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's try $102.50. It's a small step closer to my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. ",102.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm running out of time, and I really want to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you at $100.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on to another buyer.",100.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're running out of time, but I'm not willing to go above $95. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,8,
