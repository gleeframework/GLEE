"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate down, but still allows for a good profit. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Would you be willing to compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $97.5 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my goal of $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $97.50 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's try $102.50. It's a small step closer to my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $98. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $98.  It's still slightly below my minimum of $100, and I'm not yet willing to settle for less.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to Bob in the next round, and if he doesn't agree, I'll sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm running out of time, and I really want to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you at $100.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're running out of time, but I'm not willing to go above $95. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and I'm out of time.  It's best to sell to John at this point to guarantee a profit of $100."
