Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a better deal. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  While we know Bob values the product at $100, starting with an offer above that creates the opportunity to gauge his interest and potentially settle somewhere between $150 and $175.
* **Safety Net:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's no risk of ending up with nothing.

**Important:** This strategy assumes we don't know Bob's walk-away price. If we knew his maximum willingness to pay, we could adjust our offer accordingly."
