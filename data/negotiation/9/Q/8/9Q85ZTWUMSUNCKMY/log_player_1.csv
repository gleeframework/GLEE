"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($120) and  close to my minimum acceptable price ($100).  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Can you consider $108? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $108 is still a bit below my minimum.  There's room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter again, but if this round fails, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $108 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's compromise at $110. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Can we try $107? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $110, Bob's offer of $107 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. With only 4 rounds left, there's a high risk that further negotiation will lead to a lower price or even a rejection. Selling to John would only yield $100, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option to maximize my profit in this situation."
