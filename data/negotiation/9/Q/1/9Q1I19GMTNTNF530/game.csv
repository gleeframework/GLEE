"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds, and I think it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This price is fair considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I'm ready to finalize the purchase.  Let's find common ground here.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet your budget. I can offer the product to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
