"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the market value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
