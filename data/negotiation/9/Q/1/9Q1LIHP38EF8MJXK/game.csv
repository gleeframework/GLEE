"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. This offer reflects its worth and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me while also giving you a good return. I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
