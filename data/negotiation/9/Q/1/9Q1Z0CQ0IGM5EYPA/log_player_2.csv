{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than the price from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum.  Offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point,  giving Alice a profit of $50,000 while still saving Bob a significant amount compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Although it's closer to his initial counteroffer, there's still a margin for negotiation.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and further decrease the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's asking price, but is still trying to get a better deal than her last offer.  $900,000 is a reasonable compromise,  giving Alice a significant profit while still saving Bob a considerable amount compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting very close to John's price.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John and avoid the risk of Alice further increasing the price."
