Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe it's a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows Alice to see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. If he rejects this offer outright, she hasn't lost anything and can still sell to John."
