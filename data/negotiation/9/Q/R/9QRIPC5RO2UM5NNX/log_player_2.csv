"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. The price of $200 is a bit too high for me. I'll reject Alice's offer and look for a better deal.
