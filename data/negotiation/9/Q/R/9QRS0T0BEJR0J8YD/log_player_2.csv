"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to negotiate and potentially lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This establishes Bob's intention to negotiate and tests Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, Bob is still in a good position. He's only $2,000 away from his ideal price, and there are still 7 rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue exploring if he can get closer to his desired $10,000 price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he is willing to compromise but still wants a good deal.  The $11,000 price point is a reasonable midpoint between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer. This tactic keeps the negotiation moving forward without immediately risking rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has 5 rounds remaining, and he can still try to get a slightly lower price. Rejecting allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price point. By offering $12,000, he demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about closing the deal but not willing to accept a price that is significantly above his ideal value.  With 4 rounds remaining, this leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
