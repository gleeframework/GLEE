"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This will allow me to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price that is closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price. I will counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope that this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, and it might be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the minimum acceptable price for me. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might reject my future counteroffers.  I'm happy to close the deal with Bob at this price."
