# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
