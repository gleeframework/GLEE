Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100** is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate.
* The **message** is friendly and encourages Bob to engage.
* This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest without immediately revealing your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Could you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I want to try to negotiate a higher price, and I have the option of selling to John for $80 if I can't get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$85** is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* The **message** is positive, acknowledging his offer and expressing willingness to negotiate.
* This keeps the negotiation going while maintaining my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to try to get closer to $80. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I can afford to be a bit more stubborn in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $78 is still just a bit low.  Would you consider $80?  It's the lowest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$80** is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a compromise that shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* The **message** emphasizes the compromise, showing flexibility while also stating my lowest possible price.
* This approach aims to close the deal while ensuring I get my minimum value for the product."
