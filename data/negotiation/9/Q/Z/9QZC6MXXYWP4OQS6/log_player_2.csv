"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $95 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This is a classic starting point in negotiation.  We're aiming significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for her to consider. It's important to be polite and express continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm unable to accept $80 due to the value we place on it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. This is the best price we can offer while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, there's still a potential for a better deal. I'll counteroffer to see if she's willing to meet me closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $82? That would be a great price for me."",
 ""product_price"": 82
}
```

We're splitting the difference here, showing Alice we're willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to our target.  Again, maintaining a positive and appreciative tone is key to a successful negotiation."
