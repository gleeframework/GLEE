Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but still offer a price Bob might accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values it at $1,000,000, offering it above that but significantly below John's offer creates a potential win-win.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $1,150,000 offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at her minimum acceptable price."
