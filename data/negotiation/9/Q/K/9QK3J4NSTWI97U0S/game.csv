"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my maximum. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your maximum is $1,000,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
