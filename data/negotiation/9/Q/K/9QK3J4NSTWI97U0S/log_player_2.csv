"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further. By rejecting this offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my maximum. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your maximum is $1,000,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,025,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will not budge any more. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving $25,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
