{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset while still leaving room for profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a more reasonable price for me, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for you, and it's a much fairer reflection of the product's true value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking that $1,000,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at your last offer, but I'd rather not go higher than that. Can you meet me at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get the value I need.  I've already tried to negotiate with Bob, and it seems he's not willing to meet my price.  It's time to move on."
