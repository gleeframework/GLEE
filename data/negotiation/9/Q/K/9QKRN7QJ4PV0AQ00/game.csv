"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset while still leaving room for profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a more reasonable price for me, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for you, and it's a much fairer reflection of the product's true value.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking that $1,000,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at your last offer, but I'd rather not go higher than that. Can you meet me at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
