Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal for Bob and the fairness of the price for me. This creates a more positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  By not starting at my absolute minimum, I have room to counter if Bob rejects my offer. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While I want to get the best price from Bob, I'm aware that John is a backup buyer. This gives me confidence to walk away if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $95 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a bit closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to walk away if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language like ""fair price"" and ""walk away happy"" to create a more positive atmosphere.
* **Emphasizing the deal:** I'm highlighting the benefit for Bob by suggesting we ""make this deal happen."" 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  While I'm willing to lower my price, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe I should stick to my original offer of $95. I've done some research and found that the market value of the product is closer to my proposed price. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is not budging:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to his original offer, despite my counteroffer.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is wasting time, and I risk getting a worse deal or having to make further concessions.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John at $120 is a sure thing, and it ensures I get my minimum acceptable price. 

John is a reliable buyer, and I can't guarantee that Bob will ever accept a higher price. It's time to secure the sale and move on."
