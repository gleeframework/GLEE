"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation and he should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000 either. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further.  He still has several rounds to go and can always buy from John if he can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,000 is still a bit much for me.  How about $10,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is closer to his budget than previous offers, he should try to push for a lower price. He still has several rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John if he can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $12,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He has already rejected Alice's offer of $14,000, which is still above his budget.  With only a few rounds remaining, it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Buying from John ensures he gets the product for his maximum budget and avoids further negotiation."
