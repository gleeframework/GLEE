"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000 either. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit much for me.  How about $10,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $12,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",14000.0,Alice,7,
