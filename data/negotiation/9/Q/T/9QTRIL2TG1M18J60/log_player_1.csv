Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we have a strong alternative buyer (John) at $15,000.  This gives us leverage to start the negotiation high. 
* **Anchoring:** Offering a price of $20,000 sets a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is more likely to be favorable to you.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than simply rejecting the initial price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
