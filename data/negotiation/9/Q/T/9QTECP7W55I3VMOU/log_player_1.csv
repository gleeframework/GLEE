Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Profit:** Offering the product at $150 gives you a potential $30 profit margin if Bob accepts. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $150, the message implies a willingness to discuss the price (""...a great deal for the value it provides""). This leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he finds the initial price too high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception of Value:**  While the product is worth $120 to Bob, his perception of a fair price might be different. 
* **Risk Tolerance:**  A higher initial offer increases the chance of Bob rejecting the offer, forcing you to sell to John at the lower price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging the risk involved in negotiation."
