"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as much as possible. However, it's still a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $15,000.  This should give him incentive to negotiate but also leave room for me to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $9,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to my counteroffer and above my minimum price.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'm happy to accept his offer."
