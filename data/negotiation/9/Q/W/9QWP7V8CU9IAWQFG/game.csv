,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
