Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit but also ensure Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves you with a minimal gain.  Offering a price too close to $1,000,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,150,000. This represents a significant value compared to its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's privileged position as the first buyer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 price point aims for a win-win. It gives you a $150,000 profit (significantly more than John's offer) while leaving Bob with a potential $50,000 gain by his own valuation.
* **Confidence:** By confidently stating the price, you anchor the negotiation closer to your desired outcome. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your approach if Bob counters or provides additional information."
