"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident I can find a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,300,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to undervalue my product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable dropping any lower than $1,250,000. This offer is still fair to both of us, considering the value of the product.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm really not comfortable going above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no higher. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we're running out of rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob, and I'm guaranteed a good price."
