"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested, but I'd like to offer you $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, $120 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $140. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140.  However, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer $130.  This is a fair price for us both, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,
