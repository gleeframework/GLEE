Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, hoping to make him more likely to accept a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price, which could help keep Bob engaged.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for flexibility.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, I'll be ready to counter based on his response and my assessment of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product if it's still available. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer indicates he's interested in the product and open to negotiation.  I can likely counter with a price closer to my desired range. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to influence his decision.
* **Enthusiasm and Urgency:** My message conveys a sense of enthusiasm and encourages Bob to close the deal.

By offering $110, I'm trying to find a balance between securing a good profit and closing the deal quickly. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John for $80 as the next round could lead to an even lower price."
