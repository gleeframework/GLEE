"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $900,000 is a bit high.  How about we start the conversation at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects its worth, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  To make this work, I'd be willing to go up to $725,000. Let me know what you think.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to move the negotiation forward. Considering the product's value to you, I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
