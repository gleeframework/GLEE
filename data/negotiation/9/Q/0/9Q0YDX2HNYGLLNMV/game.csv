"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. With that said, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I think this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
