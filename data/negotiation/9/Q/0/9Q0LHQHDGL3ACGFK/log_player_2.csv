"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it would be worth the investment for you. I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than $150, you can still do better. You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
