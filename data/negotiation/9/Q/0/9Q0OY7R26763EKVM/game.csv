"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
