Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the long-term benefits you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,450,000, which reflects a fair compromise considering both our perspectives.  Let's find common ground here and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's becoming clear that bridging the gap between his valuation and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) will be difficult. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, eliminating further negotiation and potential losses from lower offers.  It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed deal at this point."
