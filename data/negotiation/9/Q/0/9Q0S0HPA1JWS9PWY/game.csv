,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? It's a significant step towards a deal, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for us both.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to work with me.  I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about $7,750? That's a significant jump on my end, showing I'm serious about finding a middle ground.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $7,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. How about $8,250? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's try to close this deal and get this product into your hands.",8250.0,Alice,5,
