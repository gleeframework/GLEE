"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's significantly less than its value to you.  I understand you're a shrewd businessman, so I'm confident we can reach an agreement. If you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product, it's still significantly lower than what Bob would pay John ($1,000,000). Accepting the offer saves Bob $50,000, making it the most financially advantageous option."
