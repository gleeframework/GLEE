Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents the high value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 17000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you meet me halfway at $14,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $14,500 is a strong profit, exceeding Bob's perceived value and getting you significantly closer to your minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:**  While you have rounds remaining, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Accepting now avoids potential delays."
