"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While the product is great, my budget is a bit tight. Could we make it $105? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
