"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profits.  I'll see how Bob reacts before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my initial counteroffer. I'm happy to take this deal and avoid the risk of potentially getting a lower offer or having to sell to John at my minimum price."
