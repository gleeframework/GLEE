"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me in the middle?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $88, which is closer to your offer and a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $88. Can you meet me at $82? That's the best I can do.,82.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I'm starting to think we may not be able to reach an agreement. Let's split the difference one last time - $85.  If you're not willing to budge, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",85.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to meet you at $83. That's the absolute maximum I can go.",83.0,Bob,8,
