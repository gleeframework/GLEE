"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I believe is worth at least $15,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for potential negotiation."
