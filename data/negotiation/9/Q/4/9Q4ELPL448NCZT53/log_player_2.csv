"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.**  It's not even close to a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John.** This gives you ample opportunity to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I can see in this product for myself. I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $8000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I have to consider my own minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to lower my price to $14000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above your budget.** While it's a step in the right direction, you're still not in a position to accept it. 
* **You have several rounds left, and John is a reliable alternative.** This means you can continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price without risking missing out on the product entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I understand you have a target price, and I'm aiming to be fair.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a long way from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower my price to $12500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above your budget.** While she is showing a willingness to negotiate, the price is not yet within a range that you're comfortable with.
* **You have several rounds left, and John remains a viable alternative.**  This gives you more time to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $12,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to lower my price to $11500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $11,500 is still outside of your budget.** While she's making concessions, it seems like she's not willing to go much lower. 
* **You only have 3 rounds remaining, and John offers a guaranteed deal at your maximum budget.**  It's a risk to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially lose the opportunity to buy from John.

At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John at your desired price.  Even though you could potentially get a slightly lower price from Alice, the risk of not reaching an agreement with her is too high, and you could end up with nothing."
