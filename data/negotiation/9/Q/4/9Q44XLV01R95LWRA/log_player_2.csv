# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, it's clear she's unlikely to reach my absolute limit of $800,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice won't budge significantly.  It's more strategic to take the guaranteed deal from John."
