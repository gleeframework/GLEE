"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can get closer to my goal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While he's getting closer, $9,800 is still below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round. I'm starting to think John might be a better option at this point."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm concerned we're not going to reach an agreeable price.  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is significantly better than what I'm getting from Bob."
