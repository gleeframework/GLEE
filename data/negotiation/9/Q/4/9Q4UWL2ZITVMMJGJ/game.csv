"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still getting a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $16,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to paying $16,000 for this product, which is a fair price for both of us.  It allows you to make a profit while still being within my budget. Let's try to come to an agreement at this price.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to the price. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $16,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $16,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
