"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his ideal price.  $9,500 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still looking to save more.  By rejecting this offer, he can continue to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $9,800? This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a slightly higher counteroffer than his previous attempt, showing a willingness to compromise.  $9,800 is still a good deal for him, and it leaves room for Alice to potentially accept or counter with a price closer to his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,800 is close, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this.  How about we split the difference and call it $9,900? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,900 is only $100 more than Bob's counteroffer. This is a very small difference, and accepting it means Bob gets the product for $2,100 less than what John is offering. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
