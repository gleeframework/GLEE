"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves room for you to make a significant profit, and it's closer to the value I know this product holds. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,4,
