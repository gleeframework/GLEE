"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm behind your proposal. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $12000 or less. I would like to propose a price of $15000 for the product.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $18000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I am still only able to consider offers within the range of $12000 or less. I would like to propose a price of $16000 for the product.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'd like to propose an additional concession. I'll throw in some premium support and maintenance for the product, which normally costs $2000. I'll include it in the price, so you'll get the product for $16000 and the support for free. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your effort to accommodate my budget, Alice. While I am open to considering the package deal you've proposed, I am still committed to staying within my budget of $12000. I would like to stick to the product price alone and not include any additional services. I am willing to pay $16000 for the product without any extra services.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're still committed to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell you the product for $16000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll throw in a 1-year warranty, which normally costs $1500. I'll include it in the price, so you'll get the product for $16000 and the warranty for free. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I am still unable to exceed my budget of $12000. I would like to stick to the original product price alone and not include any additional services. I am willing to pay $16000 for the product without any extra services.",16000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand you're still committed to your budget, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm making one final offer: I'll sell you the product for $16000, but I need a commitment from you that you'll purchase it today. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to consider other options. What's your decision?",16000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, thank you for your persistence and for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate your efforts, but unfortunately, I am unable to accept your latest offer of $16000. I am still committed to finding a solution that fits within my budget of $12000. I hope we can find a way to close the deal soon. In the meantime, I am prepared to purchase the product from John for $12000.",12000.0,Bob,10,
