Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate and potentially reach a price that is mutually beneficial.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're still getting a decent profit while allowing for potential negotiation.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings, so be prepared to negotiate with Bob, but also remember you have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value assessment, it's still significantly below your minimum price of $15,000. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $10,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
