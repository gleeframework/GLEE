Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and other interest, you provide a reason for the high initial price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording implies willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to counter-offer rather than just rejecting the offer outright. 

**Goal:**  The goal is to find out if Bob is willing to pay a price significantly above his perceived value of $8,000. If not, you can always come down closer to $15,000, knowing you have John as a backup."
