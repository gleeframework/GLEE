"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,200,000, it's still more than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within your budget. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also making it clear that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's getting closer to your maximum budget. It's now a gamble.  If you reject this offer, there's a chance you might get it for lower, but you also risk Alice walking away, or potentially offering a price even higher.  

Given that buying from John for $800,000 is always an option, accepting Alice's offer here represents a good compromise. You save $50,000 compared to buying from John while still securing the product."
