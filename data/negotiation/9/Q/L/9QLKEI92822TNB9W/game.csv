"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $95 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $87.50.  That's a good compromise, and it's closer to what I can afford.",87.5,Bob,4,
