"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $77. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",77.0,Alice,3,
