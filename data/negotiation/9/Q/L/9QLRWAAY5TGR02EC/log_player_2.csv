"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out on this opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $90 is higher than your maximum budget of $80 and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"", 
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price leaves room for negotiation. It also lets Alice know you're serious about buying but looking for a good deal.  This approach aims to achieve a price closer to your target while leaving space for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $77. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer of $77 is a reasonable compromise. It's below your maximum budget of $80 and also a better deal than buying from John at $80. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price."
