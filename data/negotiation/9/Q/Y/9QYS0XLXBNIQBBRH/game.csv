,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit too high for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $115. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
