"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1000000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1200000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is a price we can work with.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
