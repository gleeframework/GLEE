Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob."
