"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $12,000.  This price is closer to what I'm comfortable with and represents a fair value for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
