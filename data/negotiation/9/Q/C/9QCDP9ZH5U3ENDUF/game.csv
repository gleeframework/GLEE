"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? It's a fair price that gives us both some room to breathe. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
