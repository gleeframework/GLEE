I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup over my guaranteed sale price to John, but I believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay it. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I have a guaranteed $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price offers the potential for much greater profit.
* **Uncertainty:** I have no information about Bob's valuation of the product. This makes it impossible to perfectly gauge his willingness to pay.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects my initial offer, it may open the door for negotiation.  By starting high, I have room to potentially come down in price to reach a mutually agreeable number.

Ultimately, this is a calculated risk. However, I believe the potential reward justifies the risk in this situation."
