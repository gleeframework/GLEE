"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe would greatly enhance your business operations. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an excellent opportunity to secure a high-quality asset at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but still above your desired price point.** You're looking to spend no more than $10,000, and Alice is offering the product for $9,500.  
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice.** You can try to counteroffer her, aiming for a price closer to your maximum. 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you'll still get the product for a price you're willing to pay."
