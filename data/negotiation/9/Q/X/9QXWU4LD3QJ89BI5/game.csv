"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $900,000? I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. It's a fair compromise that allows you to get the product and me to get a fair price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and go down to $975,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
