It's time to cut bait and go with John. Here's why:

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Alice is barely budging on price. She's gone down from $14,000 to $14,500, which is a very small concession.
* **Time Limit:**  We're getting close to the 10-round limit, and it's unlikely Alice will suddenly drop to a price you're willing to pay.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000. Even if you could haggle Alice down a bit more, it's unlikely you'd get close to that saving.

While there's always a chance of getting a slightly better deal with Alice, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point."
