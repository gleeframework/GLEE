"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! Would you like to make an offer to purchase it from me? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price.  There's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but higher than her value. This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest while clearly stating our counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met us halfway from the initial offer, we're aiming to get closer to $8,000. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:** We're still below John's $10,000 price, giving us some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments, showing willingness to compromise but not capitulating.
* **""Fair Price"" Framing:** Suggesting $7,750 is fair emphasizes mutual benefit and avoids seeming overly aggressive.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the halfway point in the rounds, so it's strategic to show more flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we try $8,200? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down Concessions:**  Alice is making smaller concessions now.  We should mirror that to signal we're nearing our limit.
* **Potential for Alice to Move:**  We're still a significant amount above her value. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further, even if slightly. 
* **John Option Remains:** We're getting closer to John's price, but there's still room to play if Alice is willing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I can do $7,900, but that's really pushing it for me."",
""product_price"": 7900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  We're only increasing our offer by $150, showing Alice our willingness to compromise is decreasing.
* **""Pushing It"" Language:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and implies we're near our limit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts us very close to Alice's likely minimum price while still leaving a small buffer for a final potential round of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,100? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $8,100 is a good price, saving us $1,900 from John's offer.
* **Alice's Signal:** Alice explicitly mentioned this is close to her minimum, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **Time Remaining:** We have only a few rounds left. Pushing it further risks losing the deal entirely."
