"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it allows room for negotiation.  If Bob accepts, great! If not, we can see how much he values the product and if he's willing to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up in price.  I still have 8 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still a good amount of profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still low, but I'm not willing to accept his offer yet.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I will counteroffer again in the next round.  I have 6 rounds left to make a deal before selling to John, and I am not yet willing to sell to John for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500.  This is my last offer before I start to seriously consider selling to John.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that he needs to come up in price if he wants to get this deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low and I'm not confident that he'll come up to my desired price. I'm running out of rounds and I need to secure a sale. While I prefer to make more profit, $12,000 is a fair price and a safe bet.  I will sell to John."
