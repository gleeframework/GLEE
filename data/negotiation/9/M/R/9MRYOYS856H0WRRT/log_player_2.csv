"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $12,000. I think you'll really appreciate its value and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is starting significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or resort to buying from John for $15,000."
