"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115? Let's split the difference.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit short. How about $110? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to keep costs down.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting a little tired of this back and forth. Let's just agree on $110. It's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting tired of this back and forth, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to keep costs down.",105.0,Bob,8,
