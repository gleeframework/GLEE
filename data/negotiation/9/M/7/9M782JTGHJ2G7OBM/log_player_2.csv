# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to you:** You value the product at $150.
* **Alice's offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $140.
* **John's offer:** John is offering the product for $150. 

Since you value the product at $150, you are willing to pay up to that amount. Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price, but you can get it for even cheaper from John. Therefore, it's best to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
