Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I can do $73 for you, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product.

``` 

Alice is very unlikely to go lower than $73. Accepting this offer represents a good balance between trying to save more and potentially missing out on the deal with Alice."
