"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can strike a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $175 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
