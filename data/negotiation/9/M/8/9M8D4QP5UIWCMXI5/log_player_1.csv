I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but it's taking a lot of time and it doesn't seem like we're going to be able to get to my desired price in the remaining rounds. I'm not willing to compromise any further on the warranty.  It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
