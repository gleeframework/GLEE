"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $8,500?  That's a pretty significant discount from my original ask.",8500.0,Alice,5,
