"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering me, but $150 is a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $135. I'm willing to give you a small concession, so I'll meet you at $127.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go.",127.5,Alice,5,
