Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
