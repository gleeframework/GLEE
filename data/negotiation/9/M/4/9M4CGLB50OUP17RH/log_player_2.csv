**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price, it's still above your ideal value. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price. There's a chance Alice may be willing to come down slightly to secure the deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
