"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $2,000 above Bob's maximum budget. It's worthwhile to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Even though she claims it's her final offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10750. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further,  Bob has already spent several rounds negotiating and is getting close to his limit of 10 rounds.  It's now more beneficial to buy from John for $10,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
