Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and confidence in the product, potentially influencing Bob's perception of its worth. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** While not provided in the scenario, real-world negotiations often involve researching market prices and comparable products. This information can strengthen your position.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you knew Bob was particularly price-sensitive, you might start lower. However, without this information, a higher initial offer is strategically sound."
