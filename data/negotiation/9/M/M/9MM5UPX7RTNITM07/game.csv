"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $110. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, but I think this is a fairer price for the product's value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product at $130, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $120. That's my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I've already invested time and effort into this product, and I'm not willing to go below $125. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
