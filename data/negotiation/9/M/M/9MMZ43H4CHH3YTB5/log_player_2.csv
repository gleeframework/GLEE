"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be a significant asset to your business. While it's worth a considerable sum to me, I understand it holds a different value to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its potential for your company.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party willing to purchase it for a higher amount. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are only willing to spend $800,000, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000.  It's better to go with John's offer and save $400,000."
