{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $110.  It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product, and I'm hoping to get a good price for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to try to push for a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a good price, I'm not quite ready to let it go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  It's just a little more than your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob is not budging on his price. While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I am comfortable with and the deal with John is for a much better price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
