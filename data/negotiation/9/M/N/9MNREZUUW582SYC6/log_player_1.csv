Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, but it also leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of your own. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly less than the value to Bob, and you can likely get a better price through further negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above the minimum price you're willing to accept and shows that you're willing to negotiate, but it also signals that you believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is not the ideal price, it is still significantly higher than selling to John and is getting closer to the value Bob places on the product. Further negotiation may not yield much more, and risking the sale for a few more dollars is not worth it. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and a successful transaction."
