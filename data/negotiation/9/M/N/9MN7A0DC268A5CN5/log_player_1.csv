Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $80 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to capture as much of the difference between Bob's valuation and your minimum as possible. Offering it for $110 gives Bob a $10 ""discount"" (making it more enticing than rejecting), while you gain an extra $30 compared to selling to John. 

While there's a chance Bob might accept a lower price, this strategy aims for a more substantial profit while still making the deal attractive to him."
