"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a little low for me.  How about $135? It's a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a good amount of value from the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. How about we meet at $125? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. That's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130. How about we try $127.50?",127.5,Bob,6,
