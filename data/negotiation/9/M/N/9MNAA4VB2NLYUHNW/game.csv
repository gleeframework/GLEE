"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for a price closer to $1,000,000. I believe this would be a fair offer considering its true market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,900,000 represents a fair value considering its potential, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,450,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,325,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the value this product holds.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it represents the very top of my price range.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
