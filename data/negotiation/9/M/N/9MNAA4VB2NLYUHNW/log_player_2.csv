"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer will allow you to start negotiating a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for a price closer to $1,000,000. I believe this would be a fair offer considering its true market value."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  While I don't want to insult Alice, I need to make a strong counteroffer to steer the negotiation in my favor. Aiming for $1,000,000 gives me significant room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm hinting at the product's ""true market value"" without directly referencing John's offer. This might make Alice reconsider her pricing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message expresses interest and suggests this is a starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,900,000 represents a fair value considering its potential, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $1,450,000 is still considerably higher than John's offer.  We need to keep negotiating to close the gap further. I believe there's still room for her to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,450,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Increase:** I'm gradually increasing my offer to show Alice I'm negotiating in good faith.
* **Staying Below John:**  It's crucial to remain well below John's $1,200,000 offer to have room for further negotiation.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  I'm aiming for a price that acknowledges Alice's desire for a higher value while still being advantageous for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,325,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is continuing to lower her price, $1,325,000 is still too close to John's offer of $1,200,000.  There's not enough of a benefit to justify accepting this offer yet. I need to push Alice a bit further to see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it represents the very top of my price range."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John:** I'm now matching John's offer. This puts the pressure on Alice while staying within my budget.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my final offer, I signal to Alice that I'm serious and won't go any higher. 
* **Potential Outcomes:** Alice might accept, counter with a slightly lower price, or reject it, at which point I'll buy from John."
