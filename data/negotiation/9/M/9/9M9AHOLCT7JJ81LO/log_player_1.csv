Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that allows for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth at least that much to me, and I'm hoping to get as close to that value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher amount. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I hope this will be attractive enough to secure a deal without having to go through further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer of $925,000 is close enough to my desired price and a significant improvement over John's offer. I'll accept and sell the product to Bob."
