"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though. How about we start with $14,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $15,500.  I'm really eager to get this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
