"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",82.5,Alice,5,
