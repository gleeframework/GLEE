Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, it's still above your $80 maximum. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, making it the more financially sound decision at this point."
