"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,025,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
