"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. How does $140 sound?  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($140) is close to your maximum but still above.** You know you can get it for $150 from John, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting might lead to a better offer.** Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale entirely."
