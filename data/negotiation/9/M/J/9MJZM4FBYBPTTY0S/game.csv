"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 just doesn't cover the true value of this product. I'm willing to make a final concession - how about $15,500?  This is a very fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let me know if you're interested, as I'm also in talks with another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're in talks with another buyer, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,6,
