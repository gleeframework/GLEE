"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John for $8,000 is always a safe option, but you should try to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This is a very fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your limit. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  You can still buy from John for $8,000 if you don't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm trying to be fair with my pricing.  Let's make this work - how about $11,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have only 5 rounds left, so you need to move quickly.  You can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000, but you should keep negotiating with Alice in the hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
