Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Fair:** The message frames the price as ""fair"" to avoid seeming too aggressive while still emphasizing the product's value. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start slightly higher to allow more room to bargain. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be more appealing to ensure a fast sale."
