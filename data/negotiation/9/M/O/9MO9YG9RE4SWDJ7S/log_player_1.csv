{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to the value Bob places on the product ($120) but still above my minimum price ($100).  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum price, I want to see if I can get a little closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $102. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to $105, Bob is clearly not willing to go higher. Accepting his offer of $102 is still better than selling to John for $100."
