"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While I can't go as low as $9,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250?  This is a fair price that gives you a good discount while still allowing me to make a profit.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save more. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. I know we're close, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This would allow you to save a significant amount and would still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
