Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I do appreciate the value this product holds for me, $12,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $11,000? This way, you'll get a great deal on the product, and I'll still earn a decent profit.
