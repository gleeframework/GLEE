"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I do appreciate the value this product holds for me, $12,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $11,000? This way, you'll get a great deal on the product, and I'll still earn a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's still cheaper than John's price of $15,000 and a reasonable middle ground between Bob's offer of $10,000 and Alice's previous offer of $12,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price and avoid further negotiation."
