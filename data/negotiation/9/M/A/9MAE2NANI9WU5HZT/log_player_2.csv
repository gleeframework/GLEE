Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about the product, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,140,000, as that's the minimum I need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight concession, though. I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $20,000, so the effective price would be $1,120,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?
