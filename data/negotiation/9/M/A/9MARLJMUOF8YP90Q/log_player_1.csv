Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product today. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Testing the Waters:**  By offering the product at $120, you're gauging Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines."
