"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1150000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1100000?  This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1100000, which would be $1125000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
