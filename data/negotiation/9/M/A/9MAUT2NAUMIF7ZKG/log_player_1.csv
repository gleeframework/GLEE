Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the initial offer, netting a $5,000 profit.
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, ensuring we don't lose money. 
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message aims to establish a positive interaction, even though it's a strong opening offer."
