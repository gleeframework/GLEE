"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is fair considering the value to me and the fact that I can purchase from John for that price.  Let's close this deal and avoid going through more rounds of negotiation.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
