"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down from there. I'm hoping to get a good price while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get more, I'm happy to sell for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  This guarantees me my minimum desired value and avoids further rounds of negotiation, reducing the risk of Bob ultimately declining or me having to sell to John."
