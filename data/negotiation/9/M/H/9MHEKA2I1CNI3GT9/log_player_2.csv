# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?

The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's offering it for $200. That's too much for Bob. It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit more than you were hoping to spend, but I can't go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170

Round 4
