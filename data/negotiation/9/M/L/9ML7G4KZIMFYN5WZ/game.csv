"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $150?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $150. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,5,
