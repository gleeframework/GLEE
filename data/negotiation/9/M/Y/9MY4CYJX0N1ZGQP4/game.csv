,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is $80.  Is there any wiggle room at all?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is $80, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",80.0,Bob,6,
