"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $11,000 is more than he's willing to pay, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for your product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good price considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is now offering $10,500, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Since he can get the product for $10,000 from John, there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
