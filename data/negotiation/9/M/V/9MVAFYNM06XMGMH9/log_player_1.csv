Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However,  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
