"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $16,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little high for me. I'm really hoping to get this deal done, so how about $14,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $14,000. I can do $15,500, which is closer to my initial price. It's still a good compromise, considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
