"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a good starting point. Alice's offer is way above your budget. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $16,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

While $16,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $14,000. I can do $15,500, which is closer to my initial price. It's still a good compromise, considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

Alice is still above my budget, and it's likely she won't budge much further. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially going over my limit. It's best to just go with John's offer."
