"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is above our minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below his own valuation of the product. We have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is below its true market value. I'm confident that this product will generate significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* We're aiming for a compromise to keep the negotiation moving. 
* $900,000 is still a significant profit margin for us. 
* By emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, we're reinforcing the fairness of our counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price that allows for your profit while still being within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a more favorable price point for himself, but we're not in a hurry. We can still try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round.  The difference between his offer and John's offer is significant enough to warrant continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $890,000?  This offer reflects my desire to close this deal while ensuring a fair price for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* We're making a smaller concession this round to signal we're getting closer to our desired price.
*  $890,000 is still a substantial profit and a good balance between Bob's offer and our desired price. 
*  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price."
