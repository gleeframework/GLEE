# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $850,000, which is a 5% discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it seriously.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I've already discounted the price by 10% from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $820,000, which is just $30,000 more than your last offer. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you can consider it seriously.

Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and this offer is a reasonable compromise.  It's a significant savings compared to John's price."
