"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price lower by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is right in the middle of Alice's value ($80) and my maximum price ($100). This should be a reasonable offer that Alice might accept, while still saving me some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer, and is closer to the $100 I'd pay John.  It's still worth trying to negotiate further, as I can likely get the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price.  However, I'm still willing to go a bit lower with a counteroffer. This price is a compromise, as it's still closer to my desired price point and hopefully appealing enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting progressively higher and is approaching the price I'd pay for John. There's a high chance that further negotiations will not yield a better price, and I'm likely to end up paying a similar amount or even more. Buying from John for $100 guarantees I get the product at a price that I'm comfortable with, and avoids the risk of potentially losing a deal."
