Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid the product's value is much higher than that. Considering its uniqueness and the potential returns it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. It's a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to be flexible and meet you in the middle again. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. It's a compromise that takes into account the value of the product and the potential returns, while also showing that I'm willing to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
