"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000. I know you'll find immense value in it, and this offer reflects a balance in recognizing its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price of $800,000 and John's offer.  You can do better by rejecting her offer and going with John."
