Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000. I know you'll find immense value in it, and this offer reflects a balance in recognizing its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but we also need to give Bob an incentive to buy.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it for anything more than $800,000 gives him a potential profit if he utilizes it correctly.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at our desired price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a profitable price and ensuring we don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
