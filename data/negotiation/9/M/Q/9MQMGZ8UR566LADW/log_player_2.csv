"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $7,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $9,500 and is still within Bob's budget.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for further bargaining if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $8,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to bargain.  Buying from John for $8,000 is always an option, but it's not the most advantageous choice at this point as there's a chance Bob can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,000 for the product, which is his maximum budget and the same price John is offering.  This is a strong negotiating tactic as it demonstrates Bob's commitment to buying the product while pushing for the best possible price.  At this point, Alice has two options: accept Bob's offer and close the deal, or risk losing the sale to John."
