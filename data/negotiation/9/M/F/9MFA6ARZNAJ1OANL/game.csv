"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget. How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. It's clear we both see the value in this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500?  That's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
