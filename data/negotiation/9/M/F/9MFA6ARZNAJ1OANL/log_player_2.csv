Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. It's clear we both see the value in this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unwilling to go below $15,500.  While she might come down slightly, it's unlikely she'll budge enough to make it worth the risk of continued negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000, making it the safer and more economical choice at this point."
