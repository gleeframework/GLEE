"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $900,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $925,000 is a good price for him, saving him $275,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away or he'll end up paying more than $925,000."
