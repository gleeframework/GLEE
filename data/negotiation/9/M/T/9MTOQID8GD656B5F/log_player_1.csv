Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still walk away with a profit well above my minimum.  I'm confident I can get a good price from Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $1,200,000, it's less than what I can get from John. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's low offer, but still significantly above what I'd get from John. Hopefully, this is enticing enough for Bob to come closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, but it's still above my minimum of $1,500,000 and  close enough to John's offer that I'm willing to accept it.  I'm confident I can make up the difference elsewhere."
