Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $115? That's still a fair price for you, and it fits my budget better. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
