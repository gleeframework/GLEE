"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $115? That's still a fair price for you, and it fits my budget better.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $125? That's a good compromise, I think.",125.0,Alice,3,
