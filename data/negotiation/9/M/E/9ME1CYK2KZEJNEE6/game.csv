"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $800,000? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $800,000 is a bit rich for my blood. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  $750,000 is closer, but it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $775,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $725,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,6,
