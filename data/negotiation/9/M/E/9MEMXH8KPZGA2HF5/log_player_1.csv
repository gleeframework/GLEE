``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While $8,750 is tempting, I'm willing to risk losing this deal with Bob and see if I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
