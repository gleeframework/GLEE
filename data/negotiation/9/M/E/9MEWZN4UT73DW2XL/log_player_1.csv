Bob's offer:

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000."

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $1,200,000.  It's worth accepting to avoid potentially further rounds of negotiation with Bob that may not result in a higher offer."
