"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, acknowledging your interest. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow us to reach a compromise that is beneficial for both parties.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
