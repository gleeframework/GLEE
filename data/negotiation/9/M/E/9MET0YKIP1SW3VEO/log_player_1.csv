"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it offers you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects my offer. However, I'm not going to be unreasonable. I want to find a price that allows us to both come to a good agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap. I still have several rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, acknowledging your interest. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow us to reach a compromise that is beneficial for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting close to my desired price and it's likely Bob won't offer much more. It's a win-win situation, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity to John."
