"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm not willing to sell for $900,000, as that's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back-and-forth."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. Can we meet in the middle at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but Bob still seems hesitant to go higher.  It's risky to keep negotiating, as there's a chance we won't reach an agreement.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum price and saves time."
