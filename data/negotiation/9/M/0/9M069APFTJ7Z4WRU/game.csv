,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Is that something you'd consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back-and-forth.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
