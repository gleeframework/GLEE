"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $10,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a compromise on my end.",11500.0,Alice,3,
