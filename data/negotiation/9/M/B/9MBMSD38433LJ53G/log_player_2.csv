Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $10,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a compromise on my end.
