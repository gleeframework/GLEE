Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $105. I'll offer $102.50 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5.

We're getting close, but it's still worth pushing for a slightly higher price.  We're aiming to get Bob closer to the $110 mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $103.75?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do a bit better. I'll offer $102.00 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push Bob further, we're running into diminishing returns. Accepting $102.00 is a solid deal and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
