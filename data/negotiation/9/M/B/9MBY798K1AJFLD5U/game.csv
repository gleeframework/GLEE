"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your minimum value.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10500 is still a bit below my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a great value for you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
