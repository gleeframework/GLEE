"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10500 is still a bit below my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a great value for you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $11,000, the product is still below his maximum value of $12,000 and a good deal for him. While there's always a chance he could negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
