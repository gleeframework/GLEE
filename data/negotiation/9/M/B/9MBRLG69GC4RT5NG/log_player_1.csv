Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob is willing to pay more.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $80, so I'm not risking a lot by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $85."
