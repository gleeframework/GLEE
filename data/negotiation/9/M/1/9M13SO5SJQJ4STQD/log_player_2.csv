Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good value for my product. I can offer it to you for $105. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

While Alice is getting closer to my price, it's unlikely she'll go below $105.  I can get the product for my target price from John, so there's no point in further negotiation."
