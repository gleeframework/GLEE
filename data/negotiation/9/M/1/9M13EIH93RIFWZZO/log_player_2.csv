"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $80.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your $80 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which would be a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to being willing to sell, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the rounds. It's a safer bet to buy the product from John for $80, as that ensures I get the product within my budget."
