I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation.  It's important to build a relationship with Bob, so I'm using a friendly tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price to my minimum, but I'm also emphasizing the fairness of this price to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll finally accept and we can close the deal."
