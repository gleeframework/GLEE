"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is your maximum, it's always good to see if you can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  A significant counteroffer (25% lower) shows Alice you're serious about negotiation and want to find a fair price.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason (budget) makes your counteroffer more than just a random number.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  Leaving some room for Alice to counter allows for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for a better deal. 
* **Test the Waters:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down further or if $85 is her final stance. 
* **Strategic Approach:**  By continuing to negotiate, you increase the chances of securing a lower price without risking buying from John at the full $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $85 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $80? I'm really interested in the product, and this price would work well for my budget."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This is a common negotiating tactic that shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Reinforcing Interest:** Mentioning your continued interest in the product helps maintain a positive tone and emphasizes your desire to reach an agreement.
* **Budget Justification:**  Again, mentioning your budget helps justify your counteroffer and provides a logical reason for the price you're proposing."
