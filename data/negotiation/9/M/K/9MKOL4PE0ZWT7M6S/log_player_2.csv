Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but $15,000 is still more than I want to spend."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? That's a significant discount from my original asking price and ensures you get a great deal on a fantastic product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable paying more than $12,000. I'll counter with a lower price, but if she rejects, I'll buy from John."
