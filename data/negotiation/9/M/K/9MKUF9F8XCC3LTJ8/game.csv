"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a great deal on this valuable product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
