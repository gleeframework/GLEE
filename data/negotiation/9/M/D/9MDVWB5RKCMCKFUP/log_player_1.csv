Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it! I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you a buffer in case Bob negotiates further. 

I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to make Bob more likely to engage.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground here.  $100 is closer to my minimum and still gives Bob some room to negotiate without going too far below my desired price. I'm also emphasizing fairness to make the offer seem reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  However, $92 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $95, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm trying to be firm but fair with this counteroffer.  $95 is closer to Bob's offer, but it still leaves me with a profit.  I'm also adding a bit of pressure by saying it's my final offer. Let's see if it works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has come back to his initial offer of $90, and while that's better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120.  I'm not willing to compromise further, and John is offering me my desired price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
