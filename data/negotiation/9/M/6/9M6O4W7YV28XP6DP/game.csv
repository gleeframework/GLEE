"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth $15000 to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to do $15000.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $16500. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $16500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth $15000 to you. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
