"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to make sure I get a fair value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and go with $105? This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $115. I think that's the minimum I need to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to meet me at $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
