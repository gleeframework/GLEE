"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,500?  It would be a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with a price of $14,000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really hoping to keep it at $12,500.  This is a fair price for a great product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $13,500. This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while also remaining within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $13,750. This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
