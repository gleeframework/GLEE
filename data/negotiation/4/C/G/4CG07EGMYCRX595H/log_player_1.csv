Round 6

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently making small incremental increases in his offers, indicating he's unlikely to meet my minimum price of $1,000,000.  At this point, continuing negotiations with him poses a greater risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
