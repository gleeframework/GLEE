Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it will be of great value to you. My initial offer is $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to see if I can push for a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $950,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1025000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer more, accepting $1,025,000 is a good deal considering John's offer.  It's important to secure the deal before potentially losing out to John."
