Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is too low. We'll counter in the next round and try to negotiate closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, given the true value of this product, I'm looking for something closer to $950,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth while still being a good deal for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for a higher price, accepting $850,000 is a strong profit, exceeding our minimum and John's offer.  It's always good to leave some room for negotiation, but recognizing a good deal when it's on the table is key to successful selling."
