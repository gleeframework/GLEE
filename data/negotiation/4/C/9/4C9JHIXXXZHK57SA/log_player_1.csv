Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm prepared to make this a win-win. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Offering it at that price is unlikely to be profitable for me.
* **Negotiation Room:**  A price of $1,200,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still netting me a considerable profit above my minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while leaving me in a strong position to accept John's offer if Bob declines."
