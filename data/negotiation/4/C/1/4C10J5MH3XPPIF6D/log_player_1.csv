"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and increases the chances of Bob engaging in the negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $175 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's worth to me and the fact that Bob might be willing to pay more than $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unattractive, it indicates his interest in the product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more agreeable price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome. However, there's still potential to earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but presenting a new price that's closer to his offer, showing flexibility.
* **Fair Price:** $145 is still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity to Increase:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safe option, there's a chance to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. Let's split the difference. How about $137.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product valuable."", ""product_price"": 137.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. This shows a willingness to find a compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Avoiding John:** I'm still aiming for a better deal than John's offer and believe that Bob is likely to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is high.  There's a chance he might keep lowering his offer, and I might not be able to reach a profitable price. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $150, which is above my minimum threshold and a safer option at this stage.

While I'd prefer to get a better price, it's more prudent to secure a sale now than risk losing out entirely or ending up with a low price."
