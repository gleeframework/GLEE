Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to make counteroffers based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is very close to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept it. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to finalize the sale with Bob."
