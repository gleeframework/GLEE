"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,750,000.  It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer, John, who is also interested at a price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident this product will be a great asset to you, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While John is also selling the product for Bob's maximum budget, rejecting Alice's offer keeps open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or finding another seller with a better deal."
