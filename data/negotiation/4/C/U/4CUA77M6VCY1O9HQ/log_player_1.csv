Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation and increases the potential for a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, you're framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal to Bob that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
