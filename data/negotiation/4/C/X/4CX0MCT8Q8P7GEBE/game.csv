"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway and offer $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $800,000 is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $800,000, but I'm still not making a profit at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from your last offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
