Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway and offer $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to go up to $800,000, but I'm still not making a profit at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from your last offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,000,000.  It's unlikely she'll change her mind, and further negotiation is likely a waste of time.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is your maximum price.  It's time to cut your losses with Alice and go with the guaranteed deal."
