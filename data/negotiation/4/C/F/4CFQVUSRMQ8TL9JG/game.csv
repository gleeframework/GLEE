"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This still gives you a significant savings over the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
