"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly below your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and leaves room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. While $900,000 is still higher than her original offer, it's a good compromise and within your budget. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially sound option at this point."
