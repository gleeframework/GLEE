"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high opening offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  It also provides room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. It's too early to accept such a low offer, as there are still 8 rounds left for negotiation.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and explore if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This allows for further negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,000,000.  With 6 rounds left, there's still time to try and negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me a chance to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer, and it's my minimum acceptable price. I'm setting a firm price point, hoping Bob will finally see the value of the product and agree. I am also aware that if Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell the product to John for the same price. This gives me leverage and eliminates the risk of losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's unlikely that we will reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing money.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids further negotiation."
