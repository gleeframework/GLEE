Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $120 to start.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 
 
I am starting with a price higher than both mine and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my desired outcome.  I also want to appear confident in the product's value, which is why I didn't start at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I know I have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, so I'll use that as leverage. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that's where you see the value, but I can't go that low. Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Rejecting Bob's low offer:**  $65 is far below my minimum and even below Bob's perceived value. Rejecting it signals I'm aiming higher.
* **High counter-offer:**  While $110 is still above Bob's value, it shows I'm willing to negotiate but not drastically. 
* **Leaving room for Bob:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might counter again somewhere between $80 and $110. 
* **John as backup:**  I'm keeping in mind my option to sell to John for $100 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you considering my offer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to his perceived value, and while it's not the $110 I countered with, $85 is still a reasonable profit above my minimum. It's better to take a good offer now than risk the negotiation going sour and having to settle for John's $100."
