"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit on this sale, and $700,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $775,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $780,000?",780000.0,Alice,5,
