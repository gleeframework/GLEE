"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $14,000 is getting closer, but I can't let it go for less than $16,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering the value you're getting.",16000.0,Alice,5,
