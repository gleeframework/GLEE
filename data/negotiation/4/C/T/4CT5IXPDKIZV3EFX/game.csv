"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,650,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to go up to $1,500,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
