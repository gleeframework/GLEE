"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $900,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to  $1,100,000. This represents a significant discount on its potential value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,100,000. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
