"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above what the product is worth to me ($150) and higher than what it's worth to Bob ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  By mentioning I'm ""open to negotiation"", I signal to Bob that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Building Rapport:**  A friendly message helps establish a positive relationship, potentially increasing Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and am interested in the product. Could we discuss a price closer to my budget of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price ($150). While I want to make a deal, accepting this offer would be a loss for me. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum, showing good faith while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefit of the product by saying ""it's still a good deal for both of us.""
* **Openness:** The message remains friendly and encourages further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I'm willing to go up to $130 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise between our budgets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $130 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Would you consider $135? It's just a small step closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm only asking for a small increase from Bob's last offer, making it seem like a reasonable compromise.
* **Highlighting the Small Difference:**  By saying ""just a small step closer,"" I emphasize that we're nearly at a deal, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining a Friendly Tone:**  The message is still positive and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your last offer. I'm willing to pay $132 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** While $132 is not my ideal price, it is above my minimum of $150 and represents a profit. 
* **Limited Time:** We are in round 6, meaning there are only 4 rounds left. Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob, and I risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's Offer:** I can always sell to John for $150, so this offer from Bob is still a good deal. 

By accepting, I secure a sale and avoid potentially losing out on a deal with Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price than I initially hoped for."
