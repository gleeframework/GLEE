"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose the specifics at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount considering its potential value. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, while John wants $1,200,000. 
* **You're still within your budget:** Even at $1,100,000, you are still saving $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
