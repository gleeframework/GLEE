"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value I place on it and still leaves you with a solid profit margin. Let's get this deal done!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This offer represents a substantial compromise from my initial position, and it still leaves you with a good profit margin.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
