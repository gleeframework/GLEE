{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value I place on it and still leaves you with a solid profit margin. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is my top price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further but won't settle for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from your asking price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I appreciate Bob's effort to meet me halfway,  $1,050,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This offer represents a substantial compromise from my initial position, and it still leaves you with a good profit margin.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price.  I've already compromised significantly, and I don't want to waste any more time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
