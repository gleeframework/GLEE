Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing him to a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Having John as a backup buyer at $10,000 gives Alice leverage in the negotiation."
