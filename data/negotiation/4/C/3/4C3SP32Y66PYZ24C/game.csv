"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still a bit above $850000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $780000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $780000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'm willing to go up to $810000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $810000, but I'd like to add a small premium to the price. I'll counter with $820000. This is a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to add a premium, but I'm not willing to go above $810000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $810000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",810000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $810000 as the final price. I'm willing to make one last offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll counter with $815000. This is a compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",815000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $810000. I'm willing to accept this price and finalize the deal. I'm not interested in going back and forth anymore.",810000.0,Bob,10,
