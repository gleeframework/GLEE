Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its true value. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000, and it's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000 rather than risk further negotiation."
