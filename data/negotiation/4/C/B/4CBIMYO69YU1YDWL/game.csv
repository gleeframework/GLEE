"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm looking to pay.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $9,500.  This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $9,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
