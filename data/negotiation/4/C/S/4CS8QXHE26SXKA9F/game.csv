"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $925,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
