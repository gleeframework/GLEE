"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a rapport by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Even though we are nearing the end of the negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $13,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $15,500, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a very fair price, considering the value you'll gain from the product.  It's also a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be close enough to Bob's price range that he'll accept. It's also a good compromise, as it's closer to my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm emphasizing the value of the product again to help sway Bob.  If he rejects, I'll have to think about selling to John to avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,500, but I'm still a bit short. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,750. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I'm running out of time.  While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, I don't want to risk losing any more money. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum asking price."
