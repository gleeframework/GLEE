Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit. While she has a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, selling to Bob above that price would be ideal.

**Understanding Bob:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. He won't pay more than this figure because it would be a financial loss for him.

**The Sweet Spot:** Alice needs to find a price that's attractive to Bob (above his $1,000,000 valuation) but also profitable for her (above her $1,500,000 minimum).

**Here's Alice's offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I know its value to someone like you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Why this offer makes sense:**

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly lower than Bob's maximum valuation, giving him a potential profit of $250,000 if he chooses to leverage the product later.
* **Profitable for Alice:** Alice secures a $250,000 profit over her guaranteed sale to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message creates a feeling of scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice needs to be prepared to adjust her strategy accordingly."
