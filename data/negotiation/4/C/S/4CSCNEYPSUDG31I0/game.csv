"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to do $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit of a compromise for me, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to go down to $128, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",128.0,Alice,5,
