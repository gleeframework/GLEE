"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is a bit out of my price range at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $14,000 is really the lowest I can go at this time. I believe this product will bring you significant value, even at that price.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid $14,000 is still beyond my budget. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price for the value you'll receive. ",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for moving a bit on the price.  While $13,500 is getting closer, it's still a touch too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000?  That would work for me.",13000.0,Bob,6,
