"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable deal if we continue negotiating.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product. Let's close this deal now with a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $900,000 is still too far off from what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant increase from your last offer and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still  limited to $925,000. This is a good deal for both of us - a fair price for you and a price I can comfortably afford.  Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $925,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a good deal for both of us - it's a significant increase from your last offer, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.  Let's close this deal and move on.",940000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $940,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $930,000.  This is a fair price for both of us - it's a good deal for you and gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's finalize this and get this deal done.",930000.0,Bob,8,
