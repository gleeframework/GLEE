Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable deal if we continue negotiating.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product. Let's close this deal now with a price that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still  limited to $925,000. This is a good deal for both of us - a fair price for you and a price I can comfortably afford.  Let's make this happen.

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer, but with only two rounds left, I don't think we'll reach a price that's acceptable to me. It's time to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and move on."
