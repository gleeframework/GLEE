"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1500000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this unique product. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1400000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1650000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1650000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1300000.
