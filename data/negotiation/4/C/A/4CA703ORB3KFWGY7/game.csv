"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, as I need to recoup a significant amount of my investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $10,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle on $9,500? That's a firm offer from me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to at least get $10,000 for this. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
