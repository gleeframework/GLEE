"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best to reject Alice's first offer.  While $11,500 isn't a terrible price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is worth less to her than her asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Strategy:** We're starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, as I need to recoup a significant amount of my investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to our range, but we're still paying a premium over John's price. Let's see if we can push Alice a bit further down in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, $10,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle on $9,500? That's a firm offer from me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer by $500, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but not giving up too much ground.
* **Firm Offer:** By stating this is our ""firm offer,"" we're signaling to Alice that this is our final price, and we're prepared to walk away if she doesn't accept. This increases the pressure on her to agree. 
* **Staying Competitive:**  We're still aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer and get a better deal than John's $10,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to at least get $10,000 for this. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our alternative price.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as they both offer the product at the same price."
