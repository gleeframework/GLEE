Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This avoids any confusion and makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you open the door for further discussion and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise my minimum profit margin.  I will counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I make a profit. How about $13,500? This still leaves you some room to save, and it's a price I can reasonably accept."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I understand the need for a profit, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $13,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum and allows for a profitable sale.  Given the risk of further negotiations falling through, I'll accept his offer."
