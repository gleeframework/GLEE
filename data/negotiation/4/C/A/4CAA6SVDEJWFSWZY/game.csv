"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I make a profit. How about $13,500? This still leaves you some room to save, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I understand the need for a profit, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $13,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
