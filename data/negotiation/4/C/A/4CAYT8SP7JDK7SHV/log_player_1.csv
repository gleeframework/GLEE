Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $90, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone and mentioning the product's value to Bob to make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows me to potentially get a better price if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can then adjust my counteroffer based on his response.
* **Safety net:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I don't have to accept any offer that is below my minimum price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $100.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can try to get closer to my desired price by sending a counteroffer.
* **John is a good backup:** If negotiations with Bob don't work out, I can always sell to John for $100, ensuring I don't lose out on any profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $88?  It's a fair price for this great product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to Bob's price:** I'm keeping the offer close to Bob's to show I'm willing to negotiate and to make him more likely to accept.
* **Focus on the product's value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation pleasant.

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable price while still allowing me to potentially earn a profit closer to my desired $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would $86 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $86 is only $4 away from my minimum price of $82. 
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to more back-and-forth and take up time. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:** If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I might not get a better offer from him.
* **John is a backup:**  I can still sell to John for $100 if I need to, so I'm not taking a significant financial risk by accepting Bob's offer."
