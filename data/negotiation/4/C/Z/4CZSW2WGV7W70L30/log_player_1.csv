Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still not worth the hassle of further negotiations.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a decent profit and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting another counteroffer."
