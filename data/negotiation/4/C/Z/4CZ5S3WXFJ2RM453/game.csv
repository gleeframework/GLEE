"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, meeting you halfway. This price still reflects the product's true value, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1110000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see where you're coming from.  While $1,110,000 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be. Let's aim for a final compromise: $1,115,000. This leaves a little room for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.  What do you say?",1115000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $1,115,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,105,000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope you can understand my position.",1105000.0,Bob,6,
