"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more so than my own valuation. I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its potential worth to both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant intrinsic value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. How about we meet halfway? I propose $1,112,500.",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,075,000 again? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position on the budget, but I'm also working with my own constraints.  I'm starting to wonder if we can find common ground. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer.  However, I believe this product would be most valuable to you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your transparency about the other interested buyer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
