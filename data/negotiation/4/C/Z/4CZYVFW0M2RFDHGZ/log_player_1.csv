Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant intrinsic value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. How about we meet halfway? I propose $1,112,500."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,075,000 again? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stuck at $1,075,000. It's time to show him that walking away is a real possibility, which might push him closer to the middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position on the budget, but I'm also working with my own constraints.  I'm starting to wonder if we can find common ground. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer.  However, I believe this product would be most valuable to you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Finality:**  By stating this is the ""final offer,"" the hope is to incentivize Bob to move closer to Alice's desired price.
* **Slight Concession:**  Coming down to $1,100,000 shows a willingness to negotiate, but not by much, reinforcing the seriousness of the ""final offer."""

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency about the other interested buyer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has not budged from $1,075,000 despite Alice's attempts to move him. His ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations risks losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. While $75,000 is a difference, each round increases the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the certainty of John's offer."
