"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 significantly undervalues the product. I could consider a price of $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $760,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept anything less than $890,000. I'm confident this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $890,000. It's time to switch to John to secure the product for $800,000."
