"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 significantly undervalues the product. I could consider a price of $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $760,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept anything less than $890,000. I'm confident this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
