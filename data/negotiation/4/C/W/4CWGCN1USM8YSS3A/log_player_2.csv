# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since Alice is already offering a discount.  Let's see if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable, but I need to stay within a specific budget.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down in price and it seems like we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is a good deal, especially since John wants $1,200,000.  Let's accept this offer and move on."
