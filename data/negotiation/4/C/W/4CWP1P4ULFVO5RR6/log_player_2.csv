"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $11500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $10,500? I'm really interested in getting this product, so let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $11000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product and allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject that offer and he might end up having to buy from John anyway. Accepting Alice's offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
