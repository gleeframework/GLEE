{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500** is a starting point that is above my minimum ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 
* **The message is friendly and positive**, setting a good tone for the negotiation. 
* **I've included a question** to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $10500? I'm really interested in getting this product, so let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000),** so it's not worth accepting.
* **I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob** and believe we can find a middle ground.  
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product and allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer**, showing willingness to compromise.
* **The message reiterates my appreciation for Bob's interest** and emphasizes the product's value.
* **The counteroffer is still profitable for me** and could be acceptable to Bob, based on his stated willingness to find a ""middle ground""."
