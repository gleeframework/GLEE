"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1250000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This price aligns better with my financial situation while still reflecting the value I see in the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is a starting point, I believe the value of this product warrants a higher price.  Considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations, I'm prepared to offer a slightly adjusted price of $1150000. This allows us to find common ground while still ensuring I receive a fair return on this valuable asset.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
