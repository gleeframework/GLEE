{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This price reflects its inherent value and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,250,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob, who values it at $1,500,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, building a foundation for a positive negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer sets the stage for potential counteroffers from Bob. If he rejects it, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my position accordingly. If he accepts, I've secured a strong price. If the negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
