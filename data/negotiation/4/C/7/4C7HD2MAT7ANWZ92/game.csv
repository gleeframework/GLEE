"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $220. I think it's a fair price considering the product's quality and features.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe we can reach an even better agreement. Would $180 be within your consideration?",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $200, but that's as low as I can go. The product is worth more than that to me, and I need to make a profit.",200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I think we can find a middle ground. How about $190 for the product?",190.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $210, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",210.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $205 as the final offer for the product.",205.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $220, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. If you're not willing to meet me at $220, I'm starting to lose interest in the deal.",220.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Considering our previous discussions, I believe $215 would be a fair price for both of us. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still within my budget.",215.0,Bob,10,
