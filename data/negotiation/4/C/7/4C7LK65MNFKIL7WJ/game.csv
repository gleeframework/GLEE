"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit too high at $1,150,000. Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. If you're serious about making a deal, this is my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,200,000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
