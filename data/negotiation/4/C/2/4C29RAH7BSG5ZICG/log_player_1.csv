Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's your guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $150 to Bob might seem like you're trying to squeeze every dollar out of him, potentially making him less likely to engage. 

This strategy balances maximizing your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
