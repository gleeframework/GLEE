Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $19,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. It also signals that you believe the product is worth more than his perceived value, potentially influencing his perception.
* **Maintain a Margin:** Even if Bob negotiates down, you aim to secure a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counter-offers.  You can gradually decrease your asking price, but always keep your minimum acceptable price in mind."
