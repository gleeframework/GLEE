"Thanks for the offer Alice! While I do appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm happy to move forward if you're willing to come down to $10000. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  $11200 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10600? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product within my budget.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11400. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.
