"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my original proposal is more reflective of that. Would you consider $1,125,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However, $1,125,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my previous offer.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
