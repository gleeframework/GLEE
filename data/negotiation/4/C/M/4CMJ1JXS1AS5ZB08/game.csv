"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
