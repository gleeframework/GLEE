"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds similar value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know that John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  Alice is offering the same price.  There's no advantage to buying from Alice, as you can get the product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open."
