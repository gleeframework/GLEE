Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me is $1,200,000. I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is very unlikely to go below $900,000. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time in negotiations."
