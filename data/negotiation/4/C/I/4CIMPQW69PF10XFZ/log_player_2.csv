"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his ideal price as possible. A counteroffer of $13,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate, but it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to accept to avoid losing the sale completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's ideal price but still within his budget.  It's more advantageous for Bob to accept this offer and avoid further negotiations. If he continues to reject, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and he risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
