Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above my minimum price of $80.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that I'll list it publicly implies he might miss out if he doesn't act now.

This strategy aims to secure a price that significantly benefits me while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
