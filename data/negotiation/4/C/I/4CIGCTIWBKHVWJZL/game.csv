"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $15000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, given my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
