Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a very competitive price considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. This is crucial information in maximizing my profit.
* **Setting a High Initial Price:** Starting at $1,250,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  My message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high price. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While I could aim for an even higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer. This price offers a good balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale. 

**Why not a lower price?:**

Offering a price much lower than $1,250,000 would leave a lot of potential profit on the table. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, I can afford to be more ambitious in my initial offer to Bob."
