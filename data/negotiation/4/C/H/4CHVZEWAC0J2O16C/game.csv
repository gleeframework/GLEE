"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great value for the product. Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $11,000, so I'll offer $10,400. That's the best I can do. Can you consider that price?",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $10,400 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. That's a very fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's finalize this deal!",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price?",10500.0,Bob,8,
