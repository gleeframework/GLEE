"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price if we continue to negotiate.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that's a significant difference from my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 to move this negotiation forward. This product offers unique value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects my best effort to find a price that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 as my final offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to commit to buying it.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
