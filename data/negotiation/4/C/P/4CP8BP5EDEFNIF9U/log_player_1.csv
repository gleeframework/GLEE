"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, aiming for a good profit margin.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly tone (""What do you think?"") encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning that it's a ""great deal"" subtly implies the product is valuable, even if Bob doesn't see it that way. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion, which allows him to counter without feeling pressured.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, his willingness to negotiate means there's still room to find a price we're both happy with. 
* **Better Deal with John:**  Selling to John immediately would secure my minimum acceptable price, but I have 10 rounds to potentially get a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and aim for a higher price.  It's a calculated risk, but potentially worth the effort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $150. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating my minimum acceptable price of $150 while acknowledging Bob's interest. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also have a firm bottom line.
* **Finality:**  By stating it's my ""final offer,"" I aim to put pressure on Bob to decide. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm not lowering the price further to emphasize that $150 is a fair value for the product. 

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards accepting while leaving room for a final compromise if he's still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $120. Is there any room for negotiation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is firm at $120, and I've already lowered my price to my minimum.  There's very little room for further compromise.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're at round 4, leaving only 6 rounds to reach a mutually acceptable price.  The risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob increases with each round.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring a profit. 

While I would prefer to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward.  John offers a safe and reliable alternative."
