"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $11,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $12,500?  This price still gives us both a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
