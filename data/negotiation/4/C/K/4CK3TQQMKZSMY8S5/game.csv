"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can do $12,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you, if I do say so myself. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You drive a hard bargain, Alice.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $12,500 is still a touch too high for me. How about we split the difference and call it $12,000 even? That's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I think you're still underestimating the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
