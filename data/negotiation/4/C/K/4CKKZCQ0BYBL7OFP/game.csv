"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.
