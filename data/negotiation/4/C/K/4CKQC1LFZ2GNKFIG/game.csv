"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a compromise at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $115. This is a fair price that benefits us both.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of offering you a final counteroffer at $125. This is as low as I can go, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,5,
