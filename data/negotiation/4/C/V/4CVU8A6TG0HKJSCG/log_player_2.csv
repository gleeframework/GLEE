"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,500,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's not a fair price considering the value to me. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, your price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This represents a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,350,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still not willing to pay that much.  I will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair offer, given the value to me and the fact that I'm willing to move on if we can't reach an agreement. I'm hoping we can come to a deal before running out of time."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. My revised offer is $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable paying that much.  I'm only $50,000 away from my maximum budget, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still slightly out of my comfort zone.  I'm ready to pay $1,200,000. This is my final offer and reflects the true value I place on the product.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. My revised offer is $1,220,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,220,000 is only $20,000 away from my maximum budget. However, given the limited rounds left and the possibility of further negotiation with Alice, it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the product altogether.  I'm better off buying the product from John for my maximum budget of $1,200,000 and guaranteeing the deal."
