"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, your price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This represents a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,350,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair offer, given the value to me and the fact that I'm willing to move on if we can't reach an agreement. I'm hoping we can come to a deal before running out of time.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. My revised offer is $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still slightly out of my comfort zone.  I'm ready to pay $1,200,000. This is my final offer and reflects the true value I place on the product.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. My revised offer is $1,220,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
