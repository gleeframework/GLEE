I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I know I can get this from John if Bob rejects the offer.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, it's a good deal for him as well, allowing him to make a profit if he resells it.  This strategy maximizes my profit while still potentially leaving room for a mutually beneficial transaction."
