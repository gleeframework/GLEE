Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at $150, as that leaves no room for Bob to counter and I might miss out on a higher price. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly to establish a rapport and make Bob feel more comfortable negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a higher price:**  There's room to negotiate with Bob, as he has shown interest.  
* **Better opportunity with John:**  While $150 from John is my floor, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $140 is still a good deal, emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly higher price, and it's taking time and effort.  

While I'd prefer $150, it's a reasonable deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
