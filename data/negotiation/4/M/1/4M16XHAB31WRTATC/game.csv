"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we compromise at $110? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable price for the product.",110.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $100 just isn't enough for me.  How about we settle on $105? That's a fair compromise and ensures we both get something out of this deal. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,7,,
