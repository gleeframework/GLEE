# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is still above your ideal price range. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have room to negotiate a lower price, potentially getting closer to Alice's minimum value.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Alice fail."
