"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, I can't go as low as $13500. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows you to get the product at a great value. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,3,
