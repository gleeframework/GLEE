"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000?  This allows me to acknowledge your interest while staying true to the product's value.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being more in line with my financial constraints. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
