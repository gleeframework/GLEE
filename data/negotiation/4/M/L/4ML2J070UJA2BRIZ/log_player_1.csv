Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""limited time"" and ""highly beneficial"" aspects, you create a sense of urgency and value, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, suggesting you might be willing to adjust the price slightly if needed. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price of $120."
