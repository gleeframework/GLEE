Alice has come down to $920,000, which is very close to my last offer of $950,000.  While I could continue negotiating,  I'm getting closer to my limit and don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's a good price, and I'm comfortable accepting it to avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
