Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?  This would still provide you with a good profit margin, and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 9000}"
