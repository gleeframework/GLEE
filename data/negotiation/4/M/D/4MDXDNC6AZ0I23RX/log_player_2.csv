**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Alice before committing to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000?  This would still provide you with a good profit margin, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
