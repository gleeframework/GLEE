"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $10,000 for it, which I think is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
