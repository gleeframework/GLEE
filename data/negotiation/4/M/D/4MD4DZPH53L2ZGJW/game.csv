"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the potential this product holds.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think $1,325,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,325,000. How about $1,287,500?",1287500.0,Bob,6,
