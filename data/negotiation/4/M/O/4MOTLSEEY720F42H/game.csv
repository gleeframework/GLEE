"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $18,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price, considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000. My counteroffer is $14,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to purchase the product without breaking the bank.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $13,500. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $13,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,500? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us very close to a deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you.",12500.0,Alice,7,
