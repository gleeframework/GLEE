Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, it's strategic to start with a high offer.  
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the presence of other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, while still keeping you well above your fallback price of $800,000 from John."
