"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. I am willing to sell it to you for $95, which is a great value considering its quality and the benefits it provides. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is close to your maximum price, but you can likely do better. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $90 for the product. This still represents a great value, considering the product's quality and benefits. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, but you still have a few rounds to try and squeeze a bit more out of the deal. You're comfortable paying up to $100, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $87.50? This would still be a good deal for both of us and help us close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
