"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, it's still above your target price. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, as it aligns better with my budget.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is only $75,000 above your maximum, which is a small difference considering the potential profit.  It's  a good compromise, and accepting this offer allows you to avoid the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price from Alice, and you might end up losing out on the deal entirely.  It's also a better deal than buying from John, who is selling the product for $1,200,000."
