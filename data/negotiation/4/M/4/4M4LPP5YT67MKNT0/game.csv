"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer you $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it leaves room for both of us to make a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
