"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, as you value it at $1,000,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my offer of $650,000. This is a fair price considering both our perspectives and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",675000.0,Alice,5,
