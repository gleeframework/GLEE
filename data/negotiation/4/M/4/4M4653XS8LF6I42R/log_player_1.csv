{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer matches the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. There's no point in risking further negotiation or going to John, as I'll get the same price."
