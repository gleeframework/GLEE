Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  The price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately needing to go to John.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:** 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher starting price gives me the best chance of getting closer to my desired value.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate his level of interest and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By offering a price that's still profitable, I keep the option to sell to John open if negotiations with Bob stall or break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum value:** While I'm happy Bob is interested, $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. The fact that he's interested shows there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the option to sell to John open, which gives me a strong bargaining position.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his offer. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it'll be a worthwhile investment for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000), signaling my willingness to compromise.
* **Still Profitable:**  $10,500 is well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a Compromise:**  It presents a more agreeable price point that may be acceptable to Bob.
* **Test the Waters:**  Bob's response will indicate whether he's willing to pay closer to my desired price or if we need further negotiations.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  By staying above my minimum price, I can still walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, $10,000 is still not enough. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I continue to negotiate with Bob, it's likely he'll push for a lower price, further jeopardizing my desired profit margin.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a less favorable outcome.

**Strategy:**

While I'm disappointed that I can't secure a higher price from Bob, selling to John guarantees I reach my minimum goal and ensures I don't risk lowering the price further.  This decision prioritizes stability and certainty over the potential for a slightly higher price with Bob."
