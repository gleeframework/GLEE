"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price. However, it's still more than I would get from John. I need to counter, but not be too greedy.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
