"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I've received a competing offer from another buyer, and I need to consider that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $1400000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1400000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as high as $1300000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
