"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's a good chance you can get a better price.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell since her offer is significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). By rejecting her first offer, you create an opportunity for her to propose a lower price."
