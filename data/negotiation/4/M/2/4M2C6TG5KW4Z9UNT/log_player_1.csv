Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
