Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  Considering the value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is too low for me. I believe the product is worth more than that, and I want to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to make a profit.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. Let's try $1000000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair deal considering the value to both of us.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
