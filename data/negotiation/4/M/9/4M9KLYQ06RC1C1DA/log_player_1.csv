Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than your guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* There's no way to know Bob's valuation, so offering a higher price increases your potential earnings. 
* If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic starting point, and you may need to adjust based on Bob's reaction."
