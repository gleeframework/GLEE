Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation with him or selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

$800,000 is significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for the product. While I'm aware that Bob may be willing to go higher, I'm not willing to settle for that price right now. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,500,000 to $1,200,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and may entice Bob to negotiate further."

Bob is not budging from his offer of $800,000. While I could continue to counteroffer, it seems he's not willing to negotiate higher.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further time and effort in negotiation."
