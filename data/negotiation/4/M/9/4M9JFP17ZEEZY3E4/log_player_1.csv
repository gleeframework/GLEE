"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $135. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but demonstrates a willingness to compromise and hopefully leads to a quick agreement."
