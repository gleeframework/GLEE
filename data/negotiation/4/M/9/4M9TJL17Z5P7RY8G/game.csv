"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than $10000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $10500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500, which reflects the value I'm placing on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $11500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to offer $11000 for the product.  Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11000 just doesn't cover my costs for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $11250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's make this happen!",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10750 for the product. This would be a fair compromise that allows us to reach a deal while still respecting each other's needs. Let's see if we can agree on this figure.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that.  $10750 is still not enough for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.",11000.0,Alice,7,
