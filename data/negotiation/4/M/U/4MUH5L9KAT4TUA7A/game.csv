"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's still a great deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000.  This still gives you a substantial discount while allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to recover a reasonable amount.  I believe this is a fair and final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
