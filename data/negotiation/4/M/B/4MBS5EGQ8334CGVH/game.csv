"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what you're getting.  What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,700,000 is closer, but still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
