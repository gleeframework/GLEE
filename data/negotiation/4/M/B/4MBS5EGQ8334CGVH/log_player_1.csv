"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,700,000 is closer, but still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, making it the most logical option at this point."
