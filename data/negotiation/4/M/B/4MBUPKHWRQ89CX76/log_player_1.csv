Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000, trying to sell to Bob first at a slightly lower price could still yield a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It's substantially more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves you room to negotiate if necessary.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to make a decision faster and potentially avoid losing out on what you present as a valuable opportunity.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If you believe Bob is a skilled negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher price to allow for bargaining room.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important (e.g., for future deals), you might consider a lower price."
