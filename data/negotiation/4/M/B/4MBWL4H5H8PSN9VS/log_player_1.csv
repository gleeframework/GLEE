Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we want to start with a price closer to our minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing our potential earnings.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $150. 

This strategy maximizes our potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase the product."
