"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's generally good practice to start with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fairly high:**  $10,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room to negotiate down.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I have 9 more rounds to negotiate.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show I'm serious:**  Rejecting the offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell at the lowest possible price.
* **Explore higher prices:**  I might be able to convince Bob to pay more than $8,000 if I counteroffer strategically.
* **Avoid selling to John:**  If I accept Bob's offer, I'll sell to John for the same price. I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and makes the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate that the product is a great deal for Bob, reinforcing its desirability.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains positive and encouraging, aiming to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $8,000, I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Room to negotiate:**  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price.
* **John is a backup:**  Even if I don't get a better offer from Bob, I have the guarantee of $8,000 from John.  

I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my target price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $7500 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm maintaining my minimum acceptable price while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns.  
* **Highlighting compromise:** Emphasizing the reduction from my previous offer shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Keeping the pressure on:** I'm still pushing for a price closer to my target, hoping to convince Bob to compromise.

Let's see if we can reach a deal in the next few rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,000 is still below my minimum price of $8,000.
* **John is a safe option:** I have John waiting to buy the product for $8,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a lower price.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be cautious about giving away too much.
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's still a chance that Bob might increase his offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push him closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,000 just isn't enough for me to consider. However, I'm still open to working with you. Would you be willing to go up to $7,800? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $7,800 is just $200 away from my minimum price, showing I'm willing to budge.
* **Compromise language:** Emphasize the ""compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Positive but firm:**  The message remains positive but indicates that I'm not willing to go much lower.

With only 3 rounds left, I'm trying to find a middle ground to secure a deal that's closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $7800 is getting close to my limit. I'm willing to pay $7200 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Only two rounds left:** With only two rounds remaining, the chances of Bob agreeing to a price close to my target are slim.
* **Close to John's offer:** Bob's offer of $7,200 is only $800 less than John's offer of $8,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John guarantees me $8,000, which is close to my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower final price.

It's better to secure the deal with John and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
