Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal.  How about we settle this at $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $900,000 is still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but gives me a good profit margin above my minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing adds a touch of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
