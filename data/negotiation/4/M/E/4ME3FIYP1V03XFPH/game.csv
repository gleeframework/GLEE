"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if that sounds good to you!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value the product will bring to you, while also being a good deal for me.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about we split the difference at $11,000?  I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. How about we try $11,250? I think that's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and it's a small step closer to your target price.",11250.0,Alice,5,
