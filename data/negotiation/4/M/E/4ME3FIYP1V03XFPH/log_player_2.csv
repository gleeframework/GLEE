"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if that sounds good to you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value the product will bring to you, while also being a good deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still try to negotiate a lower price and save more money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about we split the difference at $11,000?  I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. How about we try $11,250? I think that's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and it's a small step closer to your target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further,  $11,250 is a good price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
