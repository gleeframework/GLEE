"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,800. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach at this point.",10800.0,Alice,5,
