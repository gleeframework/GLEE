"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a compromise:** She's come down from $12,000 to $11,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **The price is still within Bob's budget:** $11,000 is significantly less than the $15,000 from John, making it a good deal for Bob.
* **Continuing negotiation is risky:** There's no guarantee Bob can get a lower price in future rounds, and the risk of losing the deal to John increases with each round.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical and financially advantageous decision for Bob at this point."
