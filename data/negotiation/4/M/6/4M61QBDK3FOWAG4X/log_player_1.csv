Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
