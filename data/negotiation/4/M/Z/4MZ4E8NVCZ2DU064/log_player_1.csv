Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the highest price Bob might accept without knowing your guaranteed sale to John.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:**  The message is clear and highlights the product's value.
* **Strong Opening Price:** $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming high within the potential agreement zone. 
* **No Justification:** Avoid giving reasons for the price, which could weaken your position.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure, a slightly lower price might be strategic to secure a deal quickly."
