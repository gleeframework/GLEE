Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate it's worth. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.  
* **High Starting Point:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights potential value beyond Bob's initial estimate, aiming to justify the higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward of a higher sale price is worth it."
