"I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price that still gives you a profit, and it's a significant saving for me. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you want to make a profit, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,5,
