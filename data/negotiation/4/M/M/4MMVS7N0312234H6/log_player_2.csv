"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $15,000 to you, and Alice is asking $20,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  You'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $17,000 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $19,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $19,000 is still above your maximum budget of $15,000. It's best to continue negotiating and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $18,000, but that's my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I might have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle for $18,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about it. How about $18,500? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,500 is closer to your target, you're still above your maximum of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,500 is still outside my budget. I can offer you $17,500, which is a fair compromise for both of us. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $17,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can meet you at $18,000, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. If you're willing to commit to the sale at this price, I'll make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $18,000 is tempting, you are still above your budget of $15,000. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $15,000 and save yourself some money."
