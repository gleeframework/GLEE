"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by me due to its unique features and benefits. Considering its worth to you might be around $80, I'm still confident that this product could significantly enhance your experience or needs. I kindly request you to consider purchasing it for $120, which I believe strikes a fair balance between the value perceived by both of us. Thank you for your time and consideration.
