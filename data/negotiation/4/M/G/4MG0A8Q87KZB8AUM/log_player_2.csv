# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1400000.  It's a valuable asset with great potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This represents a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better deal. There's a chance Alice might lower her offer further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1200000? This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer, as he's not likely to get a lower price.  While he could choose to buy from John, there's no advantage to doing so."
