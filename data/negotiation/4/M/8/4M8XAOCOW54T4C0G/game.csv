"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value significantly exceeds $1,200,000 for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,500,000. This reflects the true worth and potential of what's being offered.  Let me know if this price point aligns better with your assessment.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, finding a middle ground is important. How about this: I can offer the product for $1,425,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1375000.0,Bob,6,
