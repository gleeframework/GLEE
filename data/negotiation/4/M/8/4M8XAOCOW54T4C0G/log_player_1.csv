""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Even though Bob's offer matches John's, it's still early in the negotiation. There's room to potentially secure a higher price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value significantly exceeds $1,200,000 for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,500,000. This reflects the true worth and potential of what's being offered.  Let me know if this price point aligns better with your assessment."",
""product_price"": 1500000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our desired range, we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table if we accept.  We'll try to push him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, finding a middle ground is important. How about this: I can offer the product for $1,425,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1425000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and accepting this offer secures a significant profit above John's standing offer. It's time to close the deal."
