"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for it. This price is within my budget and I believe it's fair considering my needs.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $13,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to go a little higher.  $15,500 is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. This is a fair compromise considering your minimum and my budget. Let's make this happen.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17,000. I'm getting a bit concerned that if we don't meet at a price I'm comfortable with, I'll have to explore other options. Can you consider this price?",17000.0,Alice,5,
