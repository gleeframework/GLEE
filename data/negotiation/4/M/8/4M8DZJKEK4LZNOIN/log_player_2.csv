You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

You can do better than $11,500.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and I accept $11,000 for the product?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.

You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price.  You're within $500 of your desired price point, so pushing for a little more might be worth the effort."
