Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think?,90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $85. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $75, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $75, which would be $80. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $80. I'm willing to meet you at $78, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $78, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $82. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $82. I'm willing to meet you at $79, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",79.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $79, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $81. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150. Please let me know your final decision.",80.0,Bob,10,
