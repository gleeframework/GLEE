"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value and my own needs. I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,300,000 is the lowest I can go at this point. If you're serious about acquiring this product, let's try to find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still below what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I understand your needs, but I'm not willing to go above $1,280,000. This is my last offer, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
