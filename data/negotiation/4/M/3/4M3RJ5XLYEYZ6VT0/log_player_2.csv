"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1500000.  It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe you'll find its value far exceeds the price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,500,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for a lower price from John. It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better deal, especially when you have a backup option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1000000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay, and he can get the product for a lower price from John.  There's still room for Alice to come down further, so it's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price."
