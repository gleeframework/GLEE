"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000, which is the price I've been offered by another seller. Can we meet in the middle at $1,625,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $1,625,000 is still below my minimum, and I have time to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,625,000 is still below what I need to get for this product.  How about $1,675,000?

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,675,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,600,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for a product that I'm really interested in acquiring. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,600,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to try and get a higher price.  I'm not going to give up yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 still isn't quite meeting my needs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $1,650,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,600,000 is too high, so I'll try $1,575,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,575,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to see if I can get a bit closer to my target price. I'm not willing to accept a deal that's significantly below my value for the product."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're committed to this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,575,000 just isn't quite enough for me. Let's settle at $1,600,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last push to get the price down. I'll meet you at $1,575,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really need to get this product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where it's becoming clear that Bob and I are too far apart in our price expectations.  It's unlikely we'll be able to reach a deal that satisfies both of us. Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
