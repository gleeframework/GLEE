{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he's likely to consider the offer.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $15,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** You're not asking for your full minimum, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

If Bob rejects the offer, you can analyze his counteroffer and adjust your strategy. You can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to accept. While you can negotiate, it's important to remember your minimum price is $15,000. Selling to John for $15,000 is a secure option, and you should aim to get closer to that price in your counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for some flexibility for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Moves you closer to your minimum:** $13,000 is closer to your desired $15,000.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  It allows Bob to potentially counteroffer again, while still staying within your acceptable range.
* **Shows flexibility:** You've demonstrated a willingness to compromise, increasing the chances of a deal.

Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John if you feel Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, and I'm still interested. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $11,500 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  You have a guaranteed sale with John for a much better price, so it's not worth risking a lower profit with Bob. You should counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  While $11,500 is still below my minimum,  I'm willing to consider $12,500 as a final compromise.  This price is closer to your offer and allows us both to find a middle ground.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Gets closer to Bob's offer:**  This shows you are willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Still stays above your minimum:**  It's essential to maintain your minimum price and avoid a significantly lower profit.
* **Positions you for a potential final deal:**  This counteroffer could be the final offer, and you've set a clear price point for Bob to consider.

If Bob still rejects, you can confidently move on to selling to John."
