"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional product. It's worth a minimum of $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  Let's start with an initial price of $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1500000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a substantial investment for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $800000 is a significant investment. However, it's far below what this product is truly worth.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to lower my price to $1150000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential value of this product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $800000. This is the highest I can go, and I truly believe this product has the potential to be worth more than that to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're committed to your $800000 offer, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits this product holds. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850000, which represents a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  This feels like a fair offer considering the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  However, $850000 is still below my minimum valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a fair compromise given the potential value of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your continued flexibility, $900000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $875000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",875000.0,Bob,8,
