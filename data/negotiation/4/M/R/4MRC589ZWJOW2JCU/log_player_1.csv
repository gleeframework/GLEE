{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional product. It's worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  Let's start with an initial price of $1,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1500000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a substantial investment for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $800,000 is a significant investment. However, it's far below what this product is truly worth.  Let's meet halfway.

This reflects a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $800000. This is the highest I can go, and I truly believe this product has the potential to be worth more than that to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Bob is sticking to his $800,000 offer, but that's far too low for me. I'm still holding out hope for a better deal, so I'll counteroffer again."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850000, which represents a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  This feels like a fair offer considering the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your continued flexibility, $900000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $875000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum valuation. While I am willing to negotiate,  I am not willing to drop below $900,000. To secure a guaranteed sale and avoid further negotiation, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
