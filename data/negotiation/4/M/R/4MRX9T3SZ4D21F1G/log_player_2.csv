"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. Therefore, it's logical to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer of $900,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob wants to get a good deal, but also doesn't want to risk losing the product by making an offer that's too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will budge even more. There's potential to save an additional $50,000, which is significant."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than what John is offering, but he's now making a more moderate counteroffer.  He's increased his offer from $900,000 to $950,000, showing willingness to compromise, but still leaving some room for Alice to negotiate.  This strategy increases the chances of Alice accepting the offer while potentially still saving Bob some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice is unwilling to go any lower than $1,080,000. This price is higher than what John is offering, and Bob has already rejected Alice's previous offer.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks getting stuck in a prolonged back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better deal.  It's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
