"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount, and you want to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still a good deal for me. While I would prefer to pay even less, I've already rejected one offer and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $110 is a reasonable price that allows me to save money compared to buying from John."
