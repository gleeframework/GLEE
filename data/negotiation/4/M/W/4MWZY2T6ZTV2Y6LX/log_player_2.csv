"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $8,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice first, as there's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

Bob is trying to get as close to his $8,000 limit as possible, so he starts with a significantly lower counteroffer of $7,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price. It will also help him gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice that he is willing to compromise but is still trying to get a better price than her last offer. He's also trying to gauge her flexibility in negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $8,500 is getting closer to his budget, it's still not ideal, and he has a guaranteed deal with John for $8,000. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob is now offering Alice his maximum budget of $8,000. This is his final offer, and he's prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't accept. This puts pressure on Alice to either accept the offer or risk losing the deal."
