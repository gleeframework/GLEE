"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth $100 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite high considering her product's worth to her is significantly lower. There's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, I'm trying to gauge her flexibility and establish a lower anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Even though I'm countering aggressively, I want to maintain a polite and positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand how much Alice is willing to budge from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice budged a bit, but $85 is still too high. It seems there's room for negotiation, and I'm aiming to get closer to $70. I'll counter-offer again, but I'll be prepared to potentially meet in the middle if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was probably a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $78? "",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm signaling willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price.  
* **Targeting a Favorable Price:** $78 is still a significant saving from both her initial offer and John's price.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By suggesting a specific price, I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward."
