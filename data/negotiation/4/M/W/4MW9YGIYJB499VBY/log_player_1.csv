{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also below Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to accept.  

Remember, I'm playing the role of Alice and trying to maximize my profit. This initial offer is a strategy, and I'll adjust it based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? I think it's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,500.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle at $8,750?  I'm very interested in your product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is just above my minimum price of $8,000.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a better deal than selling to John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
