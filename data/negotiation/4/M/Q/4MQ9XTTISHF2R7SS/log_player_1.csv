Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, attempting to sell to Bob first at a higher price could net a greater profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the potential gain might incentivize him to negotiate.
* **Time Constraint:**  Adding a 24-hour time limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes potential for higher profit over the guaranteed sale.  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer."
