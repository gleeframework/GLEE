"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer or ask questions, keeping the negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price. There are still 9 rounds remaining, and I believe there's room to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I know I can get $120 from John if this negotiation fails, so I have the leverage to hold out for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but pushing for a higher price.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer is a common negotiation tactic, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I'm confident I can push for a higher price. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell.
* **John is Always an Option:** Selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed outcome, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $92.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my desired value.
* **Fair Deal:** Emphasizing that this price is a ""fair compromise"" makes it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While $92.50 is lower than my initial goal, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It also gives Bob a reasonable offer to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are stubbornly low.
* **Risk of Further Reduction:** There's a high chance that Bob will continue to offer lower prices in the next rounds.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and provides a secure and quick transaction.  The risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward of a slightly higher price."
