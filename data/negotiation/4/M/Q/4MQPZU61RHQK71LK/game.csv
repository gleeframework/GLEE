"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final counteroffer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
