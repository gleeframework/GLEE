"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer, as I can get a better price from John. However, I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob first."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
