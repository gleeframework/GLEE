"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum value for this product.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still gives you a good deal, considering the product's value to you, and allows me to get a fair price for it. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
