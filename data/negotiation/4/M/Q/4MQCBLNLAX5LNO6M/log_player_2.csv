"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's no reason to pay more. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum value for this product.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still gives you a good deal, considering the product's value to you, and allows me to get a fair price for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John guarantees that he gets the product for the lowest price.  There's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice when a better deal is already on the table."
