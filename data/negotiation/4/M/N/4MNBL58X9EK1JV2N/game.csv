"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my time.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's make this work.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $700,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to try and bridge the gap.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but we're still not quite there. I can do $750,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need you to meet me halfway on this.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to make this work, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $750,000 is still below the minimum I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $900,000.  This price is still a significant profit for you, and it allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's value.  I'm confident this is a fair and mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Alice,7,
