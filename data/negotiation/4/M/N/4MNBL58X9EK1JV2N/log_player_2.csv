Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but $700,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to try and bridge the gap.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to make this work, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $750,000 is still below the minimum I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $900,000.  This price is still a significant profit for you, and it allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's value.  I'm confident this is a fair and mutually beneficial solution.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While Alice is coming down, the price is still significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000. There's no guarantee Alice will go that low, so it's time to cut your losses and take the safe deal."
