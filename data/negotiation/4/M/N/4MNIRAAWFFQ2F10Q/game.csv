"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $16000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $14000?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range.",14000.0,Bob,4,
