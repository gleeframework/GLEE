Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range.  Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant investment for me, so I need to be sure we can reach a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still below John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer. It's unlikely Bob will reach $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best outcome at this point."
