"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, at least $800000, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right person. I'm confident it would be a great asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's potential value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
