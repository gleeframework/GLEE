Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't go lower than that. 
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **John's value:** John is willing to pay $15,000, so he is my backup option.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'm offering $14,000, which is a price that's closer to my value than Bob's. This gives Bob a chance to get a deal, while still ensuring I get a higher price than I would from John if Bob rejects the offer."
