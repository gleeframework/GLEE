"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously crafted to provide exceptional value and quality. This item is truly a testament to our dedication to excellence and innovation. Given its unique features and benefits, I believe it's worth more than $100. However, I'm willing to start our negotiation at $120. I understand that value is subjective and varies from person to person, so if this price aligns with your expectations, we can proceed with the transaction. If not, please let me know your counteroffer, and we'll work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. Thank you for considering our product, and I look forward to potentially serving you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
