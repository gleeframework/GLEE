"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $12,000 and leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I am willing to negotiate but I won't sell for less than my minimum price. I will counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm getting closer to my minimum price and John is a safe option at $12,000. I will make another counteroffer, but I'm starting to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500.  This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this is a fair price and accept.  If not, I may be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging from his offer and I'm getting very close to my minimum price.  I've made significant concessions and it's becoming clear that I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob. To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed profit, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
