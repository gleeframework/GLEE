"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me is $800000, and I'm willing to make a concession to reach a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $920000.
