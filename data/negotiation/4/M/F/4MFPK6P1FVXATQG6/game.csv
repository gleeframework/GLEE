"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm looking to save some money, but I'm still very interested in the product. Can you meet me at this price or is there some room for negotiation?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $850,000 is a fair starting point,  I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the product's true value. How about we compromise at $900,000? This would still allow you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I'm confident it's a price you can live with. Can you consider this offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?  This price reflects a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is the price I offered in round 4. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping you can accept it. If not, I'm starting to consider other options.",875000.0,Bob,6,
