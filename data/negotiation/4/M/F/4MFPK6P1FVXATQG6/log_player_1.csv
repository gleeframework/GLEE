Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm looking to save some money, but I'm still very interested in the product. Can you meet me at this price or is there some room for negotiation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $950,000.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $850,000 is a fair starting point,  I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the product's true value. How about we compromise at $900,000? This would still allow you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I'm confident it's a price you can live with. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$875,000 is close to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to risk losing the deal to John, as $875,000 is significantly better than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?  This price reflects a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is the price I offered in round 4. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping you can accept it. If not, I'm starting to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the third time Bob has offered $875,000. While I would like to get closer to $900,000,  I'm running out of time.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that is significantly better than John's offer.  It's also worth noting that Bob is starting to consider other options, which indicates that he might walk away if I reject this offer again.  It's in my best interest to accept and close the deal."
