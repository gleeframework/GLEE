"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than the value I believe this product holds. Let's meet in the middle. How about $775,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $740,000? It's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $740,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's try $760,000. It's closer to your offer and closer to what I need.  What do you think?",760000.0,Alice,5,
