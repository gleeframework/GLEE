``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept $12,000, it's not worth losing $3,000. I'll counteroffer to try and secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $14,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $14500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be within my budget of $15000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly lower than my floor.  I'll try to push for a higher price with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $14,000? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13000, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly lower than what I need. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
