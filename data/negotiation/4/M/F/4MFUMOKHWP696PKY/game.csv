"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $14500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if that works for you.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $14500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be within my budget of $15000.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  $13000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $14000? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13000, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
