Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is increasing his offer, he is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's unlikely he will reach that threshold in the remaining rounds. We have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
