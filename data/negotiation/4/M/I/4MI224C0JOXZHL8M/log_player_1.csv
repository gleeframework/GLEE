"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be acceptable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer is not unreasonable, giving Bob a chance to counter without feeling like the negotiation is completely off-track.
* **Being friendly:** A positive message helps build rapport and encourages a more collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a great product, but I have some budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's room to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to explore a better deal with Bob or fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows us to work together. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product to him, reminding him that $1,400,000 is a fair price considering its worth. 
* **Staying flexible:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer. I want to reach a deal while still maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time for a firmer stance:** I've already made significant concessions.  It's time to be more assertive and hold firm to a higher price point.
* **Opportunity for a final push:**  I still have rounds to work with Bob and try to reach a more favorable deal. It's possible he might be willing to increase his offer slightly to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,100,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to make one final adjustment to $1,300,000. This offer reflects both the value of the product to you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This counteroffer is intended as a final attempt to close a deal with Bob. I've shown flexibility, but now I need to demonstrate that I'm serious about my minimum price.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $1,300,000 is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still below my initial offer, showing a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasize urgency:**  The message emphasizes that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result:**  We've already gone through several rounds of offers and counteroffers, and it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Securing a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a significant profit. 

While I'd like to reach a deal with Bob, it's more important to secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements. Selling to John provides the best outcome for me in this situation."
