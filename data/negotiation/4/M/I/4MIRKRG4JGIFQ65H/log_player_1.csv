"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach a deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 10200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This is getting a bit frustrating.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm not sure we'll get to my minimum price point in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. It's not ideal, but it's still a decent outcome."
