Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even exceeding $1,500,000. To be fair, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer aims to gauge Bob's eagerness and perceived value.  If he accepts, you've maximized your profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can still potentially secure a price higher than John's offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. You could adjust the offer price based on your risk tolerance and how confident you feel in Bob's willingness to pay a premium."
