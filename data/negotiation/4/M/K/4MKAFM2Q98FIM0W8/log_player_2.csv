# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. It's normally priced at $200, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $120 is less than the listed price, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should reject this offer and see if Alice will come down further."
