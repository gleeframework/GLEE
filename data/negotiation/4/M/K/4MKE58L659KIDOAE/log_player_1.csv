"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price, considering it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a bit extra for your time.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
