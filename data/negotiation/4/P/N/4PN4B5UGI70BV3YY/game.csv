"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To start, I propose a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This still reflects a premium price while acknowledging your interest.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price that respects both our positions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,400,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept a price of $1,525,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,525,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not comfortable going that high.  I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
