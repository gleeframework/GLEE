"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $95. I think it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  Maintains a positive tone with Alice.
* **Signals willingness to negotiate:** Shows we're interested but not at the initial price.
* **Starts low:**  Our goal is to save money, so we begin with an offer significantly below Alice's asking price but still potentially profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to a reasonable price, we can still try to negotiate a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $78? That's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal."",
 ""product_price"": 78
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledgement:** We recognize Alice's effort to meet in the middle.
* **Slight Increase:**  Moving from $70 to $78 shows willingness to compromise but not by much.
* **Framing:** By saying ""$78 gets us closer to a deal,"" we nudge Alice towards a yes without being overly aggressive."
