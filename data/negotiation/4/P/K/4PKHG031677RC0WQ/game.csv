"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10250?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9750, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I still think we can do better. How about we meet at $9200?",9200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9200 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $9450? I'm feeling pretty flexible at this point, so I think this is the best deal we can get.",9450.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $9450. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9000.0,Bob,8,
