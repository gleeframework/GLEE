Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $600,000 feels more realistic. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter, but $600,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,400,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,400,000 is still far too high for me.  Could you consider something closer to $700,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit rich for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While ideally, we'd want to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob is unlikely to go that high. Accepting $900,000 now secures a significant profit above his initial offer and avoids the risk of him backing out completely."
