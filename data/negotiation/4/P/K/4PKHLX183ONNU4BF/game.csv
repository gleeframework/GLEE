"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $600,000 feels more realistic. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter, but $600,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,400,000 is still far too high for me.  Could you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're still a ways apart.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit rich for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,6,
