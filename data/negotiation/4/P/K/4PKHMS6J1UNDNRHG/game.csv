"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a significant discount from its true value to you. Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,1,
