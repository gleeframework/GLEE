Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a high price, but I'm also aware that Bob might reject it.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything less than $1,000,000. 

I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While I'd be happy to sell to Bob for $1,000,000, I'm not going to settle for that just yet.  I'm confident I can get more, and I'm willing to put in the effort to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit from the original offer, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  While I'd still like to get more, I'm not sure how much more I can push for.  Selling to Bob for $1,150,000 is a good deal, and I'm happy to finalize the sale."
