"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a good price, there's potential to get it even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping for something closer to $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to strike a middle ground. He's not aiming for the absolute lowest price, but a significant discount compared to the initial offer. This counteroffer demonstrates good faith and shows Alice he's serious about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $135. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. Bob has already achieved a $5 discount from the initial offer, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a drawn-out process.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that is still within his budget and a decent deal."
