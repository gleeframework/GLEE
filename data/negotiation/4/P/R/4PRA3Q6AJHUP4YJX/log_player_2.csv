Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1650000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1700000 to show you I'm serious about working with you. This reflects the product's true value, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.
