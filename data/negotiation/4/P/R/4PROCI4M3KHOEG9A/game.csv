"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiating further, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me is $800000. I'm willing to meet in the middle and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $900000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $900000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1500000, and I'm not willing to sell it to you at a lower price. I'm afraid our negotiation has reached a stalemate. I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him. Thank you for your time, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors.",1500000.0,Alice,7,,
