"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target value. I have 9 rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I know the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still slightly lower than my target, it's a good deal considering the limited time left in the negotiations. The risk of losing Bob completely and having to sell to John for a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price in the future rounds."
