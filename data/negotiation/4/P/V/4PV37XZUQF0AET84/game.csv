"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
