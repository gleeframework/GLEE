"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.**  Even though Bob values the product at $15,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 saves him $3,000. 
* **It's still a good deal for Alice.** Alice values the product at $8,000, so she's making a profit of $4,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice for Bob."
