(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $85 is close to your budget, you have the option to buy from John for $80.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, so it makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed savings with John."
