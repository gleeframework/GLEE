Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts:
    * You make $1,500 more than selling to John.
    * Bob gets the product for $500 less than its value to him.
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out on a good deal."
