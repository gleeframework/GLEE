Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John.

Therefore, offering the product at $119 gives Bob a chance to buy it at a price he might consider reasonable (saving $1) while still earning a profit of $19 for Alice. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
