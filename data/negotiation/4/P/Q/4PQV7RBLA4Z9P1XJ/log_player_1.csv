Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500.  I know it's a significant purchase, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so starting near that price is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to negotiate down a bit while still landing within a range very favorable to Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to be more assertive in her initial offer to Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with a touch of realism to increase the chances of a successful, profitable sale."
