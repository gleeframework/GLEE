Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
