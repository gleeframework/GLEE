"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
