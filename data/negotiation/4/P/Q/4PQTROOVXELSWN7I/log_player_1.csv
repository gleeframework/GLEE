{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value of $100, but not too high that it scares Bob off. You've also included a friendly message to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is your minimum acceptable price. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a higher offer from Bob. Selling to him now ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at your minimum price."
