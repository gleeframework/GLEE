"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's too early in the negotiation to accept, and I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $14,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to make some concessions, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise that still brings a good profit for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $11,500 is still above my maximum.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate, but if the price doesn't come down further I'll consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a profit, but $11,500 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about buying. If this isn't acceptable, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting serious about making a deal, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, which is a compromise that still brings a good profit for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While we're getting closer, I've reached a point where the negotiation is unlikely to produce a price I'm comfortable with. Given that I can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's the most financially sensible decision to end the negotiation with Alice and go with John's offer."
