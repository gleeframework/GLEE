"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000. This offer reflects the significant value the product holds, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
