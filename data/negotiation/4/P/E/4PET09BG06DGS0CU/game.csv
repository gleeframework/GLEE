"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and still gives you a significant profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while still offering you a good profit. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise again and offer $890,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
