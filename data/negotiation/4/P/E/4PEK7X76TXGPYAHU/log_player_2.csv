"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $110 is still above your maximum budget, and you have 9 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me right now. How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I have 7 more rounds and I'm determined to get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford right now.  Let's try $95.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $98. It's getting close to your target, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$98 is still a little bit above my budget, but I'm determined to get it for $90 or less. I have 5 more rounds to negotiate with Alice, so I'm going to keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still hoping for a price of $90, but I'm willing to go up to $93. This is a fair price that allows me to buy the product and stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $96. It's a good price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I've only got 3 rounds left and Alice is still not willing to go lower than $96, which is more than I want to pay. I've been trying to negotiate, but it seems like she's not budging much.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $80,  even if it means I miss out on a deal with Alice."
