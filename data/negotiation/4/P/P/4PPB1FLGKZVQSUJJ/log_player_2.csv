"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,500. This is a one-time opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is slightly above his maximum budget, he can get the same product from John for $12,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product for a lower price from John."
