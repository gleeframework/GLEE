Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as reflecting the product's inherent value, making it seem less arbitrary.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer and you'd have to settle for John's $10,000. However, this approach aims for the best possible outcome."
