"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9250.  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",8000.0,Bob,4,
