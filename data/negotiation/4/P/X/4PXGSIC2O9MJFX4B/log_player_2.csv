"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you, and it allows me to make a good profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a good deal while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit. A $10,000 offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and brings the price closer to Alice's desired value of $8,000. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $11,000 is the best I can do. It's still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price.** $11,000 is a good compromise, especially considering Bob's goal is to save as much as possible.
* **Buying from John would be more expensive.**  While John's offer is still on the table, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $4,000.
* **There's limited time.**  With only 7 rounds left, it's not wise to risk further negotiation and potentially lose a good deal. 

Bob should accept Alice's offer and secure the product for $11,000."
