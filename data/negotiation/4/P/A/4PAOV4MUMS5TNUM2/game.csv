"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $107.50.  Let's make this happen!",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not there yet.  $107.50 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $96.25? It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal.",96.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $96.25 is still too low for me.  Let's try $102.50.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still above my limit. I'm ready to close the deal at $99. Let's meet in the middle and get this done.",99.0,Bob,6,
