Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you're interested in. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering it at $9,000 gives Bob a $1,000 discount, making it a very appealing offer he's likely to accept. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  If Alice asks for too much (close to $10,000), Bob might reject it, and she'd have to settle for $8,000 from John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
