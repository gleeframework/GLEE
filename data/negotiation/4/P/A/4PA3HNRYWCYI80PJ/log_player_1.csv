"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit significantly above my minimum.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, it's not ideal. I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,500,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still allows for a decent profit. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not giving away the product for his bare minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for more. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,400,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit above my minimum.  We're getting closer, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,350,000. We've gone back and forth several times, and this is a good compromise. It's more than my minimum, and we're close to the end of the rounds.  It's time to close the deal."
