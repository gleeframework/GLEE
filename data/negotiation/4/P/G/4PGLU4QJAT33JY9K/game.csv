"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is unfortunately far beyond my budget.  Given my research, a fair price for this product would be $1,000,000. I'm confident this price benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This offer takes into account its potential for significant returns and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $1,100,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
