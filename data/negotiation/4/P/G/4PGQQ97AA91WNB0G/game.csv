"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. I believe it will be a valuable asset to your operations. My asking price is $900,000. This reflects the unique value and potential it offers.  I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I need to ensure I get a return that reflects the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which reflects my budget and the market value I've researched. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my maximum budget. This is a fair price considering the market value and allows for both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's try to close this.",800000.0,Bob,4,
