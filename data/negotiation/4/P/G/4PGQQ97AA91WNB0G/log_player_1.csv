This reflects the unique value and potential it offers.  I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I need to ensure I get a return that reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which reflects my budget and the market value I've researched. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is not a terrible price, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I have a few rounds left and I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my maximum budget. This is a fair price considering the market value and allows for both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's try to close this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
