{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle of our valuations, giving Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to earn a bit more, $95 is a good price considering Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's significantly more than I would get from John, and it's closer to the middle ground than our previous offers.  I'll accept his offer."
