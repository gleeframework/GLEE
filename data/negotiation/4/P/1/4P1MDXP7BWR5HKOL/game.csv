"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $140 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $115 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $111. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to move the product quickly. What do you say?",111.0,Alice,5,
