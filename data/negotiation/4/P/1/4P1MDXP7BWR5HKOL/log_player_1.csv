{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me ($120) and to Bob ($120). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** The message explicitly invites Bob to negotiate. 

**Note:** This strategy assumes a win-win situation is possible. If Bob is unlikely to pay more than $120, it might be better to directly offer that price to avoid wasting time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $140 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is not acceptable, I have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, which is my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $140 to $115.
* **Still profitable:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm still maintaining a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Clear price:**  I'm clearly stating the new price in the message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $115 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for one more counteroffer:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I can likely get a price closer to my minimum by making one more counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If this negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $120, which is my minimum value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $111. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to move the product quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway again by lowering my price from $115 to $111. 
* **Almost at minimum:** This price is only $9 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm still using a positive and friendly tone, emphasizing that this is a good deal for both of us. 
* **Urgency:** I've added a hint of urgency (""allows me to move the product quickly"") to encourage Bob to make a decision."
