Bob should reject the offer. $14,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $9,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise at $11,500. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still outside of Bob's budget.  While there's a chance he could negotiate further with Alice, it's likely that the price will remain above his target, and the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.  It's better for him to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with from John."
