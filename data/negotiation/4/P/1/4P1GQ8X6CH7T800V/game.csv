"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,300,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price point that works for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However,  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I recognize your interest. How about we settle at $850,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
