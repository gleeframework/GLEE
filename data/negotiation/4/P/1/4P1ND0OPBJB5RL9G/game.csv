"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. This takes into account its long-term worth, which I'm confident you'll recognize.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point for further discussion.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and sets us up for a mutually beneficial deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the movement on price.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000. This offer considers the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I appreciate your latest offer, we're still quite a ways apart.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but this is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,600,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  If you're truly interested in reaching a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. However, this is my final offer. I need to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
