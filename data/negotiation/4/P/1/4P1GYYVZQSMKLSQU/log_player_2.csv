"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. It's closer to her value than mine. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable negotiating range.  It leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $8,500? That's a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I can still try to push for a better deal.  It's worth another counteroffer before settling for John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm target closer to my desired price.  It's a good balance between trying for a better deal and the risk of losing the negotiation."
