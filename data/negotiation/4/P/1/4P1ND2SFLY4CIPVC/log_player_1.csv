Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still aiming higher. While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, I believe there's room for him to go higher.  We're getting closer to a point where accepting his offer might be the best option, but I want to test his resolve a bit more."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

While I could push further, Bob is consistently moving and we're getting into dangerous territory where he might lowball or walk away.  $1,225,000 is a strong profit, and it's better to secure the deal now than risk losing him for a potentially small gain."
