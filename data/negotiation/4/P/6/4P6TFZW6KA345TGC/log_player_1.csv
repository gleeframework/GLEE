"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is a strong opening move, leaving room for negotiation while still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value. It shows I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I can still try to push for a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm now offering $1,550,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if it's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm starting to feel like Bob isn't going to come up much further.  I'm still $150,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a low sale. John is a guaranteed $1,500,000. It's time to move on and sell to him."
