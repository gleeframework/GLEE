{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be very interested in.  It's a unique opportunity.  I'm happy to provide more details about the product and its potential value to you.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it allows room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the potential value to Bob, which encourages him to consider the product seriously.
* **Open to discussion:** I end by inviting Bob to engage in a conversation, signaling that I'm open to negotiating.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the need to maximize my profit while keeping the John alternative in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. Here's why:

* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer as leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a safety net and strengthens my bargaining position.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than his offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible.  $12,000 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $13,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and showing appreciation for his interest.
* **Maintaining a higher price:**  I propose a price of $13,500, which is a compromise but still closer to my desired value.
* **Focus on finding common ground:**  I use language like ""split the difference"" and ""find common ground"" to show that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  This counteroffer is still above John's offer, ensuring I have a fallback option if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to close the deal:

* **Profit Maximization:** While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a profit significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but also carries the risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Closing the Deal:**  This offer is in the sweet spot - good profit, minimal risk.

This is a pragmatic decision, balancing the potential for more with the certainty of a good deal."
