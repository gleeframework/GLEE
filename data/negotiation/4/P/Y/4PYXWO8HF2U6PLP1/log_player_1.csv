Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to come up on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,125,000. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay under $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still too low for me, and I'm getting the feeling that we're not going to be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'd rather sell to John for $1,500,000 and avoid further negotiations."
