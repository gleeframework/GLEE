"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,125,000. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay under $1,000,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
