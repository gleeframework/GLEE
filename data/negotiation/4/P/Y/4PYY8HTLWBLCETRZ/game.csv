"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000.  I know it's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects that while still being a good deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This still represents a significant saving for you compared to your initial valuation, and it's a price I can accept. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, and I think this price is still a good compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This represents a significant price difference for you compared to your original assessment, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to move forward with this offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $962,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a final offer. Please let me know if you're willing to accept.",962500.0,Bob,6,
