"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $95.  You should try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $90, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still able to get the product for less than $90.  Try negotiating with Alice again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $88.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I can do $92, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, you've negotiated down to $92, but it seems Alice is firm on that price. You're closer to your goal of $80, but it's not worth risking further negotiation.  John is offering the product for $100, which is still a better deal than $92."
