"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. My starting price is $1,000,000. This price reflects the high quality and potential of this product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, it is worth only $800,000 to Alice. There's significant room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $900,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows for a good return for me, while giving you a significant advantage with this product. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $950,000 is still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer gives him another opportunity to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000. However, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. I believe this price offers a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 925000}
