"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $900,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a successful deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows for a good return for me, while giving you a significant advantage with this product. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000. However, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. I believe this price offers a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",925000.0,Bob,4,
