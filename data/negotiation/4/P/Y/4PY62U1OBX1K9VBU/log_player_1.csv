Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $900,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a successful deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000. However, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. I believe this price offers a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.
