"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him room to negotiate. It also leaves me with a substantial profit margin, well above my minimum of $800,000. 

By starting high, I aim to establish a strong negotiating position and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still significantly less than the $1,200,000 I initially offered.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. It demonstrates flexibility while still allowing me to secure a price closer to my initial goal. This approach shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong bargaining position."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,075,000 is still a good price, it's not quite where I want to be. I believe I can still push for a bit more. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and I need to make a decision. While $1,000,000 is only slightly above my minimum of $800,000, it's still a significant profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer would mean selling to John for $800,000, which is less desirable. Accepting Bob's offer secures a deal and ensures a profit.  While I might have been able to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly better price."
