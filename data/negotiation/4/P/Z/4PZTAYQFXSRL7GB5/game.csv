"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick off negotiations, I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your valuation, the product's value to me is quite significant. Let's meet closer to the middle - how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us move forward with this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
