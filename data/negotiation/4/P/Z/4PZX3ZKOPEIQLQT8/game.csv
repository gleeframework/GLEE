"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it would be a valuable asset for you, considering its potential to generate significant returns. I'm starting with an offer of $900,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $750,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still a significant investment for you.  Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to $800,000. Can you consider $825,000? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Bob,4,
