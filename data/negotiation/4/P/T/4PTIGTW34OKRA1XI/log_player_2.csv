"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($90)** is lower than what you'd pay John ($100). 
* You save $10 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($80), you still come out ahead financially."
