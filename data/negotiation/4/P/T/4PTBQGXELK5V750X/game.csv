"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I can do, I'm still a bit over budget. How about $1,100,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a little over my budget at $1,125,000.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,115,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
