Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum price:** This gives you room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price.
* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This creates incentive for Bob to accept and potentially negotiate a lower price.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This helps to keep the negotiation efficient.

By starting with a lower price, you have the flexibility to negotiate upwards if Bob counteroffers. However, if Bob rejects the offer or counteroffers too low, you can always move on to John, who will purchase the product for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500?  It's a good price and I'm ready to buy right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer.  Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we do $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower.  I'm not willing to sell the product at such a large discount.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  It's possible that I could reach a price closer to my minimum price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, or I could simply sell the product to John at a much higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $7,500 is simply not feasible for me. How about we split the difference at $8,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a great deal and me to cover my costs. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
