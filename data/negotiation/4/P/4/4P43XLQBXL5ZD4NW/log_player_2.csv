"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $7,500 is simply not feasible for me. How about we split the difference at $8,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a great deal and me to cover my costs. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between her offer ($8,250) and John's price ($8,000) is relatively small. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and secure the $8,000 price."
