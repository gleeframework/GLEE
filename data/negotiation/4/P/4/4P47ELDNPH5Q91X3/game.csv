"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only able to offer $700000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for this product. I'm counteroffering at $950000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and your initial offer.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $850000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm counteroffering at $900000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $900000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the concessions we've both made. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $862500. This is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",862500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not getting to my minimum value. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my target. I'm counteroffering at $882500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",882500.0,Alice,9,
