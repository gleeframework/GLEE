Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $78.  While I could try to negotiate him up a few dollars, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Taking the guaranteed $100 from John is the best business decision at this point."
