I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm firm on not going below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below it.  I'm concerned that we might go back and forth for a while without reaching a deal. John is offering my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him to guarantee a good price."
