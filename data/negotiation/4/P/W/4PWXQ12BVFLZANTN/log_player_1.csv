{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, which could encourage him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000, so I'm offering $12,250. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $12,250 is above my minimum of $12,000 and a fair compromise. I'll accept his offer."
