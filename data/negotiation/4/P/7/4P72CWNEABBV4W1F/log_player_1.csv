"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,000, knowing it's above Bob's valuation but leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario while also maximizing my initial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,000.  This is still above Bob's initial offer, but a step down from my initial asking price. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also aiming for a more favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to offer $15,500. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob may not be willing to go higher, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will finally secure a deal while still achieving a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky one!  Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price. While I could theoretically keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get more, and I risk running out of time.  

Accepting Bob's offer means a secure deal at my minimum value.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
