{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's $1,000 lower than his maximum. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it is closer than her initial offer, Bob can continue to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still many rounds left to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise while still trying to stay below his maximum. This gives Alice a chance to accept without feeling like she's losing too much, and it keeps Bob from having to buy from John at his full budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still $500 above what Bob is willing to pay. With several rounds left, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**
