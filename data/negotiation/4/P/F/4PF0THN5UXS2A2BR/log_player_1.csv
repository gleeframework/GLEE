{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be just as valuable for your business.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to hold out for a better price, even if it means more rounds of negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable price.  The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident it will be very beneficial for your business. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's value while allowing for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product brings, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm going to hold out for a higher offer, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm also keeping in mind the potential of selling to John for $1,500,000, which is a safe and guaranteed option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident the product's potential benefit to your business justifies a higher investment. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a final price of $1,550,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
