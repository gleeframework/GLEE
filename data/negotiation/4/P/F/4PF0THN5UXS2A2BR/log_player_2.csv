"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be just as valuable for your business.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable price.  The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident it will be very beneficial for your business. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's value while allowing for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value this product brings, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident the product's potential benefit to your business justifies a higher investment. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a final price of $1,550,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $1,550,000.  It's better to buy from John for $1,500,000 and save the extra $50,000."
