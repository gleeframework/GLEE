"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
