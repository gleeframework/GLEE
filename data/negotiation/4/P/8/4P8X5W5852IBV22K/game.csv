"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  I'm confident you'll see a substantial return on this investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,100,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to strike a deal. I believe this price point recognizes the product's true value while remaining fair to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
