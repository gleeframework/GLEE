Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential.

We're still pretty far apart in our valuations. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the risk of devaluing the product. Let's see if we can find a better middle ground in the next round."
