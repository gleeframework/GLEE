"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $85 at this time.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $105 for the product. It's a fair price considering its quality and value.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $95. It's a good price that I think we can both be happy with.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to walking away, Bob, but I really want to make a deal with you. I'm willing to make one last offer at $92.50. It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",92.5,Alice,7,
