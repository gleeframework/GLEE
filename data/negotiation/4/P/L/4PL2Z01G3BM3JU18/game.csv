"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $1,325,000, and that's as low as I can go.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
