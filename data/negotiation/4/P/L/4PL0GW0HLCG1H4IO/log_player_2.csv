"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. How does $90 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You can get the product for $100 from John, and Alice is offering it for $90. While that is a better price than John, it is still above your maximum budget of $100. You should reject the offer and buy from John."
