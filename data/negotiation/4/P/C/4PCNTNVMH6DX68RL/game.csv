"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. I'll accept $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still leaves room for both of us to profit. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this point.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to compromise further.  $775,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be, but I'm open to finalizing the deal at $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product and would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
