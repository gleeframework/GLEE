"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, so we start significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" we provide a reason for the high initial price without revealing our hand.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence can subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A strong counteroffer indicates strong interest.
2. **Establish a High Anchor:**  Even if rejected, this high price sets a reference point for future offers.
3. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** We have plenty of rounds to work our way down strategically.

We'll adjust our approach based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. While I understand its value, I would like to propose a price closer to my budget. How about $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below our desired outcome. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's very interested and willing to negotiate substantially above his initial perceived value. We have ample room to negotiate further and aim higher. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, we'll counter with a price significantly lower than our initial offer but still above our minimum. The goal is to signal flexibility while maintaining pressure for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000?  I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We've lowered our price by $200,000, a significant concession that shows flexibility and encourages Bob to reciprocate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic aims to create a sense of fairness and compromise, even though we're still closer to our initial offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces its worth and justifies the higher price point.

**Goal:**

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while pushing Bob closer to our desired selling price.  We're keeping an eye on our minimum while striving for the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly settle on $2,000,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $2,000,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating a strong desire for the product and a willingness to pay well above his initial perception of its value.
* **Time Value:** We still have several rounds left, but there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a substantially better result. Accepting now secures a very good outcome.

**Conclusion:**

While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's offer of $1,500,000 isn't worth it in this scenario. Accepting Bob's offer of $2,000,000 represents a successful negotiation and a highly profitable outcome."
