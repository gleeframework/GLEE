Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is priced above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to encourage him to counter-offer if he's truly interested.
* **Below John's Offer:** The price is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer ($15,000), ensuring you're making a profit even if Bob negotiates you down. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to find a price that works for both of you while maximizing your profit."
