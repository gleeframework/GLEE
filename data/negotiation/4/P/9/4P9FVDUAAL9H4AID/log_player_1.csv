Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is below its true value.  Could you consider $1,200,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating strong interest. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and aim for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we settle at $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is clearly demonstrating his upper limit. Accepting $1,125,000 secures a strong profit, significantly exceeding John's offer. It's always possible Bob could walk away, so taking this offer now is the less risky strategy."
