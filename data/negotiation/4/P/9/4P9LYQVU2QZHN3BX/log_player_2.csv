"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $9,500. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than your own valuation."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target price, he still has the possibility of getting a better deal. By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate with Alice and attempt to lower the price further.  He still has some room to work with before having to resort to buying from John."
