Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident that the product is valuable enough to warrant a high price, and I want to see if Bob is truly interested in paying a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for a higher price, and I want to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, and it's close enough to my desired price point.  I'm happy to accept this offer and finalize the deal."
