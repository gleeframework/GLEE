"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is quite low for the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $155, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",155.0,Bob,4,
