"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $17,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this work for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
