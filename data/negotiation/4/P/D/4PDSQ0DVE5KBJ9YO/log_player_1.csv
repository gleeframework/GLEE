Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down later.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but it's important to remember that this value might be negotiable, and he might be willing to pay a bit more if he really needs the product. 
* **Below Your Guaranteed Price:** The offer is still below your guaranteed price from John ($15,000), ensuring a profit if Bob accepts. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob. If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's room to negotiate down towards his perceived value while still staying above your minimum acceptable price."
