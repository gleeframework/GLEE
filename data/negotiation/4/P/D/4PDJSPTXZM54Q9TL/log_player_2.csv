"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than your maximum valuation of $100 and John's offer of $100. It makes sense to reject this initial offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals to Alice that her initial price is too high.
* **Significant Difference:** By offering $75, we're aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's starting point. This increases the chance of reaching a compromise closer to your desired price range. 
* **Respectful Communication:** The message remains polite and respectful, acknowledging Alice's offer while clearly stating your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, the price of $75 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $112? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $112 is still more than your $100 limit and John's standing offer. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I could go a little higher, but $112 is still more than I'd like to spend. How about $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're increasing our offer from $75 to $90, demonstrating willingness to move closer to Alice's price. However, the increase is still moderate.
* **Below Limit, Above Midpoint:** The offer of $90 stays below your $100 limit while being above the midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. This aims to find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Continued Communication:** The message maintains a polite and collaborative tone, expressing understanding while firmly stating your price limit."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 matches your maximum budget and John's offer.  There's no benefit to further negotiation or buying from John, as you've reached the best possible price."
