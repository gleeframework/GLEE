# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a slight discount. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Savings:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **No downside:**  Even though the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he can still acquire it for less. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob misses out on the potential savings."
