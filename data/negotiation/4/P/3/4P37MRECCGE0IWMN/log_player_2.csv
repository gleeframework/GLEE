"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm offering it to you first for $20000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's better to counteroffer or even buy from John than to accept this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,000 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15000?  That's still a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $15,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it is still above Bob's $12,000 limit.  It's better to continue negotiating with Alice or even buy from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this.  $12000 is closer, but I still need to make a little more on this. How about $13500?  I'm not sure I can go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is getting closer to his budget, he can still buy the product for $12,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and see if she will go lower. There are still more rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $12,500?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
