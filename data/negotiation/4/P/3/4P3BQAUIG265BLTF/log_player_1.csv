Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay $120 for it at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm unwilling to go below my minimum price. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired amount."
