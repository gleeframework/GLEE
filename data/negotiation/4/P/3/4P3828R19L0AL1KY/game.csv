"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which I believe reflects its true worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you believe in the value of this product, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about we settle at $15,500? That's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
