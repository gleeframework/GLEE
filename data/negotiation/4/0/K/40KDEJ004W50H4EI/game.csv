"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it would be a valuable asset to your business. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,350,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's bridge the gap - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch to $1,100,000, but that's really my limit.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
