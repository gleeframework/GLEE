"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it would be a valuable asset to your business. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still achieve a favorable price.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it's not an outrageous number given the difference in perceived value between Alice and Bob. This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this low offer, Alice signals that she's serious about getting a fair price and encourages Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer.
* **Backup Option:** Alice has the security of John's offer, so she's not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground, But Slowly:** Alice is coming down from her initial offer but remains significantly above Bob's offer. This signals willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning ""true value,"" Alice reinforces the idea that the product is worth a substantial amount.
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:**  The phrasing ""to be fair to both of us"" suggests that Alice is open to finding a middle ground and encourages Bob to propose a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,350,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, But Not There Yet:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to Alice's minimum of $1,200,000, but there's still a gap.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** Alice has the upper hand with John's guaranteed offer. It's worth seeing if she can negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Time Consideration:** With several rounds remaining, Alice can afford to reject this offer and continue negotiating for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's bridge the gap - how about $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice makes a significant concession by dropping $100,000 from her previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to close the deal.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The new price of $1,250,000 is a strong position. It's a compromise, but still keeps Alice comfortably above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Call to Action:**  The phrase ""Let's bridge the gap"" directly encourages Bob to make a counter-offer and move closer to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch to $1,100,000, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is only $100,000 less than Alice's guaranteed offer from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a slightly higher price from Bob carries the risk that he may walk away. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means Alice gets the money sooner, which has its own inherent value."
