"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's better than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation. Alice clearly values the product at $1,000,000, leaving a potential gap for a deal that benefits both parties. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price without risking much.  He can always fall back to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $1,150,000 is slightly higher than my budget allows.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. Would you consider $1,125,000? This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** Alice's new offer is lower, but it's still above Bob's ideal price range. There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has lowered her price.  This suggests a potential for a final price closer to his target.
* **Risk management:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price without immediately committing to something that might be too expensive."
