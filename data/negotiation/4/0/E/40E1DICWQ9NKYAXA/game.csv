"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $1,150,000 is slightly higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the potential I see in this product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. Would you consider $1,125,000? This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,125,000 is closer to my range, but I'm still a bit stretched. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
