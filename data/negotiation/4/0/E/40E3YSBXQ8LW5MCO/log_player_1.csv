Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal and will really be valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for potential concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The high initial price will give you information about Bob's level of interest. If he flat-out rejects it, you know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, you can start negotiating more seriously. 
* **John Option:** Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $120. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below your minimum price of $120 and even further from your initial ask. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's message indicates he's interested in the product. By rejecting his lowball offer, you signal that you're serious about the negotiation and encourage him to make a more reasonable counter. 

You'll need to counter with a price significantly lower than your initial offer but still above your minimum. This will show Bob you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, Above Minimum:** This counteroffer drops significantly from your initial $150 ask, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate. However, it remains well above his offer and importantly, still above your $120 minimum. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This framing encourages a collaborative negotiation rather than a back-and-forth battle over price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help you gauge Bob's flexibility. If he accepts $100, you've made a decent profit. If he counters again, you can assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $75? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's counteroffer of $75 is better than his initial offer but remains below your $120 minimum.  
* **Unlikely to Negotiate Higher:**  His language (""a bit of a stretch,"" ""fair offer"") suggests he's not likely to move significantly higher. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you find acceptable. 
* **John Guarantees Profit:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $120, ensuring you don't lose money. It's better to take the guaranteed profit than risk a lower price from Bob."
