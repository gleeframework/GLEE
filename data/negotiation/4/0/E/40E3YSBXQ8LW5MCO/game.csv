"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $100?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $75? I think that's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
