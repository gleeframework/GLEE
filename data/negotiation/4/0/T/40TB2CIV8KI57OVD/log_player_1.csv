Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be happy to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and my minimum is $8,000, there's room to negotiate. Starting at $10,000 leaves space for potential compromise while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately accepts, great! If he negotiates, we can adjust accordingly. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The safety net of John's offer allows us to be firm in negotiations, knowing we won't be left with an unsold product."
