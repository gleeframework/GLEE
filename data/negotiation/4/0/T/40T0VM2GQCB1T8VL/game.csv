"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on it at $1000000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $900000 is a bit low considering the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. How about we meet at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product.

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is the midpoint between your last offer and the value you place on the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
