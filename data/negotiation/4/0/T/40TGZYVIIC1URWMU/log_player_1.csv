Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I can start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value-based language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my bottom line. This framing can make a higher price more palatable.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""Let me know what you think""), signaling willingness to discuss the price further. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject it outright.
* Observe Bob's reactions and adjust your strategy accordingly during the negotiation process."
