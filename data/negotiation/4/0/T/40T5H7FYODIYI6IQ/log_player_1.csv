Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has potential, I'm looking to invest closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to consider that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but I need to see a price that makes sense for my budget. Could you meet me halfway at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still far from our minimum. Accepting $775,000 would be a significant loss. We have room to negotiate further and try to bring him closer to at least $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $875,000?  This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's true value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $825,000. Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, $825,000 is a reasonable compromise at this stage. Bob is clearly committed to the purchase and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling completely, leaving us with potentially having to settle for John's offer."
