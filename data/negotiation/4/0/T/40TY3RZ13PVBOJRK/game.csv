"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to get closer to the value I place on this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've considered your proposal and while I understand the value you place on the product, I would like to offer $1,050,000. This is a compromise that respects both our positions. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
