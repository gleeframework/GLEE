"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price reflects the value it offers while still being a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",8000.0,Bob,4,
