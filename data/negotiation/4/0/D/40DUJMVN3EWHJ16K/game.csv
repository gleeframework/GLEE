"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident it can really make a difference. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you countering, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This feels like a fair price considering the value this product brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my maximum. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,000 is close, but I can't go that low.  I'm confident this product is worth every penny of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're confident in the product's value, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,6,
