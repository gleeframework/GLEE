Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, the product's value is considerably higher. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is slowly coming down in price, further negotiation is unlikely to reach a price significantly better than John's offer of $12,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
