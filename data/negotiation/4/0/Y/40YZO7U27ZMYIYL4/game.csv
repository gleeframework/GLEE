"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $1600000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This price still reflects the value I see in this product, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1700000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at that price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1650000. I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to be flexible here. However, $1650000 is still a bit below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. How about we settle on $1675000? It's a fair compromise that considers both our needs.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
