"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that I believe will be of great value to your business. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1200000 to me. I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. To demonstrate my confidence in its value, I'm offering it to you for a price significantly lower than its intrinsic worth. I'm sure you'll be impressed with the offer. Would you be interested in discussing this further?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
