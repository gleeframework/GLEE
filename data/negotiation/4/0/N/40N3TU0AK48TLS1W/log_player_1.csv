"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to find a price point that works for me as well. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and trying to find a middle ground. However, he's still significantly below my minimum. I need to hold firm to push him closer to a more acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can appreciate the need to find a compromise. Would you consider $805,000? This is a significant investment for me, but I'm motivated to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $805,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could try to push for a bit more, Bob's offer of $805,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my absolute minimum and shows he's serious about the purchase. Taking the sure thing at this point outweighs the risk of him walking away or further lowballing in later rounds."
