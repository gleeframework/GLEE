"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,100,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit, while offering you a significant value for your investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
