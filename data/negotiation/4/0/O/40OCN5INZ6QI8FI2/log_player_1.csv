"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. To kick off negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a more favorable outcome.  
* **Show Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  While starting high, it's important to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest and budget:**  His response will reveal how much he values the product and how much he's willing to pay.
2. **Anchor the negotiation:**  Starting high sets a reference point, making subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your proposal. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to counteroffer at $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is significantly closer to his perceived value ($800,000) than to our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). Accepting now would leave a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. We have room to negotiate and should aim to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit further from what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** By suggesting $1,750,000, we're signaling a willingness to negotiate but also holding firm on a price significantly above Bob's offer and our absolute minimum. This keeps us closer to our desired outcome.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's value proposition, aiming to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **Encouraging Movement:**  By making a significant counteroffer, we're encouraging Bob to also make a more substantial move towards our position in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value you're offering, I would like to counteroffer at $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could likely push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,600,000 represents a significant profit over our minimum ($1,500,000) and his initial offer ($1,200,000). 

It's often better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it by pushing too hard. This offer meets our criteria for a profitable sale."
