Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $13,500 is higher than Bob's value of $12,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** It's still above my minimum value of $15,000, ensuring I'm not giving it away.

By starting at a higher price, I can potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired value. However, I'm still leaving room for negotiation to avoid immediately pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell it for less than that.  

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to come down from my initial offer of $13,500 to $13,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:**  $13,000 is still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone, emphasizing a fair price and encouraging a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a little more than I can afford right now. Let's meet in the middle at $12,750. If you're willing to go that low, I'll happily take the product off your hands. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,750 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. I've already made concessions and it seems like further negotiation will only bring the price down further. 

Rather than risk another round of negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my minimum value and saves me the time and effort of continued negotiation."
