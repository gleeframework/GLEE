"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a little more than I can afford right now. Let's meet in the middle at $12,750. If you're willing to go that low, I'll happily take the product off your hands.",12750.0,Bob,4,
