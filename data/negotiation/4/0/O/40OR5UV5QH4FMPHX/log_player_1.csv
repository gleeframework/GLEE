Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $250,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more. 

However, there's no guarantee Bob will accept. If he rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer."
