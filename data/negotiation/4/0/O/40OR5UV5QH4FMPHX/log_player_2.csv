"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000).** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to buy from John for the maximum price you are willing to pay ($1,500,000).**

While you could save a little by buying from Alice, it's only $50,000. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John allows you to stick to your budget."
