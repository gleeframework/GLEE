"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that's worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  I believe it holds similar value for you as well.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price that allows for some profit for me while still being attractive to you.  Consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and competition by mentioning another buyer. However, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at a lower price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down closer to your price range or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
