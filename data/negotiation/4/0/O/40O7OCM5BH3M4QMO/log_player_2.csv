# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our exclusive product to you. This item holds significant value to me and I believe it would be equally beneficial to you, given its worth of $12,000 to you. Considering its unique features and high demand, I am offering it to you at an exceptional price of $11,000. This opportunity is not to be missed, as it represents a substantial saving compared to its market value. I look forward to hearing your response soon. Kind regards, Alice.

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Value:** $12,000
* **Alice's Value:** $10,000
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,000
* **John's Offer:** $12,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though it's cheaper than John's price, Bob can still get the product for his maximum value by buying from John.  There's no need to accept a price higher than Alice's value, as Bob can get a better deal elsewhere."
