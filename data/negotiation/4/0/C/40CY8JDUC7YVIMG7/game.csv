"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $10,500 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250?  This would allow us both to walk away happy with the transaction. Let me know your thoughts!",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but no higher. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10750.0,Bob,6,
