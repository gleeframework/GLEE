Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. I also emphasize the value to him to make the deal more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly:

* **If his counteroffer is significantly lower than $12,000:** I might reject it and make a counteroffer closer to my initial price.
* **If his counteroffer is close to $12,000:**  I might accept it to finalize the deal. 
* **If the negotiations seem to be going nowhere:** I will consider selling to John for $15,000 to guarantee my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000.  This will allow me to explore if we can reach a mutually acceptable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, while also highlighting the fact that this is a compromise on my part. This aims to make the offer more appealing to Bob and increase the likelihood of acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the counteroffer, I will finalize the deal.
* If Bob rejects the counteroffer, I will assess his next offer. If it's close to $11,000, I might accept it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial $12,000.  I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product for Bob and try to reach a compromise that's acceptable for both of us. If the negotiations continue to stall or if Bob's offers remain significantly below my minimum, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $10,500 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250?  This would allow us both to walk away happy with the transaction. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I'm offering $11,250, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise further, but it's important to note that this is still above Bob's perceived value.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly tone and acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal. I'm framing the offer as a ""win-win"" situation for both of us, hoping to appeal to his sense of fairness.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts the offer, I'll finalize the deal.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next offer. If it's closer to $11,250, I might accept.  
* **Selling to John:** If Bob's offers consistently remain below $11,250 or if the negotiations drag on, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but no higher. That's the highest I'm willing to go.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already made several compromises, and it seems clear that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Rather than continuing to negotiate and risk getting stuck with a deal that's not beneficial to me, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to guarantee my desired profit."
