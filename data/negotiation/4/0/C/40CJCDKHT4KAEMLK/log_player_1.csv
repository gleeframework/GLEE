Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $9,000. I have a few more rounds to try and negotiate."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum.  John offers a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum.  I don't want to risk getting into a bidding war with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price than John's offer."
