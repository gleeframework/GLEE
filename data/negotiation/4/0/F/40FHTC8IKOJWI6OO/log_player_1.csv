Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $15000? I believe we can find a fair solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I will reject his offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $17,500? This reflects the product's value and gives you a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

Bob's offer of $16,000 is close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
