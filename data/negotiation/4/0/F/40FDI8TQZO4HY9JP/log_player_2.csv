"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* You're willing to pay up to $100, so there's room to negotiate a lower price.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $10 lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* This is a significant reduction, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing appreciation for her offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is willing to come down from $95 to $90, showing she's open to negotiation.
*  However,  $90 is still above my target price of $85.
* I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $87.50? I'm really interested in this product and think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm trying to be reasonable by splitting the difference between Alice's offer of $90 and my previous offer of $85.
* This shows I'm willing to compromise and continue negotiating.
* I'm also reiterating my interest in the product to emphasize my desire to reach a deal."
