"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,000. This is still a good deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we settle at $14,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $15,200, which is still a good profit for me. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",15200.0,Alice,5,
