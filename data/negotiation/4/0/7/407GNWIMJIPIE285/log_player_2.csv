{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice's offer of $120 is still too high. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's room for a better price.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100, which is still within my budget and gives me room to negotiate further. This price is also significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to bargain.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if she doesn't."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
