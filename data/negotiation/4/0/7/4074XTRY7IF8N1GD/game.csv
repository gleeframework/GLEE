"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I don't want to break the bank.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
