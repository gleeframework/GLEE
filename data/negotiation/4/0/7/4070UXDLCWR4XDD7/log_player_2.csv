``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price but one that still leaves room for negotiation and is well below my maximum budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay and what John is offering. I'll counteroffer again."

I am moving closer to Alice's price, but staying below my budget and leaving room for further negotiation."
