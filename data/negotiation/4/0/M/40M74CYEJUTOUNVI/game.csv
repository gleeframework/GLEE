"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1200000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $750000 for this product,  as I believe it's a fair price considering its potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850000.  This is a significant commitment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $900000 is still a bit too much. I'm willing to offer $825000 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This is really the absolute highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but $875000 is still out of my reach.  However, I'm willing to go all in with a final offer of $810000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. Let's seal this agreement.",810000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really invested in this deal, and I appreciate your commitment. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875000 and $810000, which is $842500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",842500.0,Alice,9,
