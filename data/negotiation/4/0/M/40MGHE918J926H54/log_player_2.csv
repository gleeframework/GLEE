"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  It's something I've been holding onto for a while, and I'm finally ready to let it go. I'm confident it's worth at least $15,000 to someone like you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, and it ensures I get a good price as well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
