"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to me. However,  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
