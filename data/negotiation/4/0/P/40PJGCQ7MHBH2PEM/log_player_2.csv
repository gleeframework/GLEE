{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a good price, it's still above my maximum of $15,000.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to me. However,  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I am proposing a counteroffer of $12,500 for the product. This price aims to strike a balance between your budget and our desired profit margin. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's price of $15,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and me having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  It's a good deal for me."
