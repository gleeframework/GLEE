Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to me. However,  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
