Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your position carefully, and in the spirit of finding a resolution, I'm willing to make my final offer: $1,450,000.  This price represents a significant compromise on my end and is my absolute bottom line. I have other interested parties, so I encourage you to consider this offer seriously and quickly.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice has consistently rejected your offers and is still way above your budget. Her final offer of $1,450,000 is too far from your $800,000 limit. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds.  You're better off securing the product from John at your target price."
