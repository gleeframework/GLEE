"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down Alice, but $120 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $80? I think that's a fair price.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
