Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to both of us.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high but within reason. Starting at $925,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still securing a significant profit over your alternative sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob provides leverage.  He stands to gain a $75,000 discount if he accepts.
* **Confidence and Positioning:**  The message conveys the product's value and your willingness to negotiate a fair deal, but also implies you have other options if necessary."
