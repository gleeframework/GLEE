Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. My initial price is $1,750,000, reflecting the high value and potential of this product.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer from Bob, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  John is willing to pay the same amount, so accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and successful sale."
