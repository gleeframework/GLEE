Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, maximizing profit means trying to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 gives Bob a significant discount ($50,000) compared to what it's worth to him. This makes the offer very tempting.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency that might push Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer, leading to a slightly lower profit ($1,200,000 from John). However, the potential for a higher profit by selling to Bob justifies the risk in this scenario."
