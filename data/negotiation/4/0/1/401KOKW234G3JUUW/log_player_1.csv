Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure you'd be happy with the price I'm offering.  I'm asking for $14,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is strategically priced:

* **Higher than your minimum:** It's above your minimum of $10,000, so you'd still make a good profit.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it tempting for him to buy.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob balks at the price, you can potentially negotiate down a bit, still ensuring you earn more than selling to John."
