"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $760,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $760,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $820,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",820000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position. To avoid further back and forth, I'm willing to meet you at $780,000. This is my final offer â€“ let me know if it works for you.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $780,000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'll make one more counteroffer, and it's a bit higher than my previous one. I'll sell the product to you for $835,000. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",835000.0,Alice,7,
