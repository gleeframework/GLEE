"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This sets a strong initial position and gives me a good starting point for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm rejecting his offer because I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I believe this price is fair and a good middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider a fair price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a further compromise, showing willingness to negotiate, but still a good amount above Bob's current offer. I hope this will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation isn't going in my favor.  I've lowered my price considerably, and Bob keeps offering less.  I've reached a point where I'm close to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John and secure the sale."
