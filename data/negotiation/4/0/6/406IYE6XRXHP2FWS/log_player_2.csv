"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price.  It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob can potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still a substantial amount. This counteroffer serves two purposes:

1. **Testing the waters:** It gauges how flexible Alice is and whether she's willing to negotiate further.
2. **Setting a lower anchor:** By starting lower, Bob can potentially push Alice to accept a price closer to his desired target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer and is much closer to Bob's desired price.  While there's always the chance of getting an even lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for a much higher price outweighs the potential for further savings.  Accepting the offer is a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
