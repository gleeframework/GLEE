"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This allows for negotiation room.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, aiming to incentivize him to accept.
* **Open ended:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, setting the stage for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $9500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($8,000), it's still below my desired profit margin.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to counter with a price closer to my ideal. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 more rounds to reach an agreement.  There's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit high on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This would be a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This strategy demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Still above minimum:** The counteroffer is significantly higher than my minimum price, but below my initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Positive language:** The message is positive and encourages a continued dialogue, keeping the negotiation moving forward."

{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer.  I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you be willing to go to $10,500? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm raising the price slightly, showing that I'm still aiming for a better deal, but not drastically changing my position.

* **Urgency with finality:** The phrase ""we can finalize the transaction"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept."
