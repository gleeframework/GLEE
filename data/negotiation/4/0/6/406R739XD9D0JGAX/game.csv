"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
