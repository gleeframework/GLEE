"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 4

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me. I'm also considering selling to John, so I need to be strategic about my offers to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000. This is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation and Bob seems unwilling to budge.  I've lowered my price considerably already and am getting close to my minimum.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum, I'll accept that offer and move on."
