{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you make a profit. 
* **It's a round number:** This makes it easier for Bob to process.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better deal without jeopardizing your minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's below my minimum value of $12,000, and I'm not willing to accept a significant loss.
* **There's potential to negotiate:** I believe Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he values the product as much as $10,000. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer since it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm going to reject it and try one more time to meet in the middle.  Here's why:

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,750 is still below my $12,000 minimum, and I'm hesitant to take a significant loss.
* **Only a small gap:** The difference between our offers is now only $250.  I think I can get Bob to come up a little more.

I'll send another counteroffer, hoping to finalize the deal with Bob and avoid selling to John."
