"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I think that's a fair offer considering my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  While I appreciate the increase in your offer, we're still quite a ways apart. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,600,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
