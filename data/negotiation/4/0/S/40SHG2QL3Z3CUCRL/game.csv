,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I understand the product's value to you is different from mine. I'm willing to come down to $850000, but I'm not comfortable going lower than that. Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $850000 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $775000 is closer, I'm still not at a point where I can accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $795000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and accept $800000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay this amount.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,7,
