"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with an offer of $25000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a purchase, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $22000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth more than your initial offer. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $18000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go up to $22000. My revised counteroffer is $20000. Can you consider that?",20000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $20000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $21500 is the minimum I can go. I believe the product's value is worth more, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",21500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think $19000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",19000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $20750 is the lowest I can go. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think?",20750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $20750 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $19000 and $20750, which would be $19875. Can you consider that?",19875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $19875 and $20750, which would be $20312.50. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our positions. What do you think?",20312.5,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think $19500 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm getting close to considering buying from John, but I'd like to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. Can you consider that?",19500.0,Bob,10,
