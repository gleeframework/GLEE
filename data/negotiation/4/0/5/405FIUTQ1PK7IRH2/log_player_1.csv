I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better price if I keep negotiating. I'm confident I can secure a better price from Bob within the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value and quality of the product, I am willing to pay $155 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $155 is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still below my initial goal, it's a reasonable compromise, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure a sale at this price than risk losing the deal entirely."
