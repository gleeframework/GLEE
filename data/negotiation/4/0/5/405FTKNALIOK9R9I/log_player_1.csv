"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation and ensures a good profit for me. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to go that low?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a good deal, I can likely get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  This would still give you a great value for the product, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
I'm offering a slightly lower price to show flexibility but still staying above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, $105 is a good compromise,  and it's within my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $80."
