"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still above your target of $150. You have time and the option to buy from John, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to go that low? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where it's likely Alice would be willing to negotiate further. It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to show that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  This would still give you a great value for the product, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target. You still have time and the option to buy from John, so rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy to see if you can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer but still staying below your desired price. It shows that you're willing to negotiate but are also firm on your price. This could be a good strategy for reaching an agreement quickly."
