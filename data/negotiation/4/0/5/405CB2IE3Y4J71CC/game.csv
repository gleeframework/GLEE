"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
