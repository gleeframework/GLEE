Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can see how much he's willing to pay and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is only slightly lower than my initial offer and still above my minimum price of $100. It's a good deal, and I'd rather accept it than risk further negotiation."
