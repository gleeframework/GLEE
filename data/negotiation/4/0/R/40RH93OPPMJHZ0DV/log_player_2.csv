"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can still get the product for $12,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the $12,000 price from John. However, there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit. A counteroffer of $12,500 is a reasonable starting point, showing Bob's serious intent to buy but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is only $1,500 more than Bob's target price from John.  It's likely Alice won't go any lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and being forced to pay John's higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob time and effort, and still allows him to acquire the product at a relatively good price."
