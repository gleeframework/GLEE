"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming for a price that is a good starting point for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it is below my minimum value for the product. I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go lower than $15,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at a loss. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob.  There's a chance he might increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects, I'll be forced to seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
