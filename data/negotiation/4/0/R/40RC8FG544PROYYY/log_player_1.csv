Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($120) than Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **Negotiation room:** A $100 price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, while still being a good starting point.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob refuses my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he is interested and willing to negotiate.
* **John's offer is a good fallback:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me the leverage to counteroffer Bob and aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? Let's find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows a willingness to compromise and find a fair price.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $92.50 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not losing out on potential profit.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $88.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Small but significant increase:**  Bob's offer has increased, demonstrating his continued interest.  However, the increase is not enough to reach a point where I'm comfortable selling.
* **Maintain leverage and aim higher:** By rejecting the offer, I can continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to my desired range.  I still have the safety net of selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price.  $88 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($92.50) and Bob's offer ($88). This shows continued willingness to compromise and find a fair price.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $90 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not losing out on potential profit.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product.  This could encourage Bob to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference again and go with $89.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $89 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  The negotiation has reached a point where the incremental price increases are small, and it's becoming unlikely that Bob will meet my minimum price. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John for $120 provides a guaranteed profit that is higher than what I can potentially achieve with Bob at this point.

It's better to accept the guaranteed profit from John rather than risk further negotiation rounds with Bob that may not lead to a successful sale."
