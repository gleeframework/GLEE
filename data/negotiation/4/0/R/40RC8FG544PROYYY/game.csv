,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? Let's find a price we're both happy with.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $88.  Let's see if we can make this work.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price.  $88 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference again and go with $89.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.",89.0,Bob,6,
