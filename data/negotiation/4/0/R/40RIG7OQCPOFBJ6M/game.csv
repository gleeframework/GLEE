"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that recognizes your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
