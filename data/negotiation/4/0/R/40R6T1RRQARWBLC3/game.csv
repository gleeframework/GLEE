,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $105? Let's find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John for $100 if we can't find common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
