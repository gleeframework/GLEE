Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting at $110, I'm setting a high bar and leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving space for counteroffer:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to a counteroffer, which encourages Bob to engage.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  The offer is still above my minimum value of $100, ensuring I don't sell below my desired price.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is interested, his offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price by counteroffering.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, John's offer of $100 is a guaranteed backup if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffering with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $110 to $95, showing flexibility but still maintaining a price that's acceptable to me.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum value of $100, ensuring I get a reasonable price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. If that works for you, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Even if I accept Bob's offer, John's offer of $100 provides a safety net in case the deal with Bob falls through.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It secures a sale above my minimum price while still allowing me to potentially sell to John for a higher price if necessary."
