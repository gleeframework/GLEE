Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" compared to your alternative offer.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" can create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept.

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob declines, but the potential for a higher sale price makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
