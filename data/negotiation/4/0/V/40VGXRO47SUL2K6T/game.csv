"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a fortune, and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a substantial discount, considering its true value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least cover my costs. How about $1,050,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
