Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer.  I'll also keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I could accept and get something, it's a huge loss compared to my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $12,000.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, but it's also a significant reduction from my initial offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to $12,000.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, but I want to keep the option open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also a bit closer to my minimum value, so I'm still not giving away too much. If Bob rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge much on his price.  I've already made concessions, but he's still too far below my minimum.  To avoid further negotiation and potential losses, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000. This guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further risk."
