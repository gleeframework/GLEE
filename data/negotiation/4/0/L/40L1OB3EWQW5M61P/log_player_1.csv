Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **Bob:**  Saves $50,000 compared to your guaranteed sale price.
    * **You (Alice):**  Earn $150,000 more than Bob values the product for.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning that this offer is exclusive and time-sensitive might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John at your desired price of $1,200,000."
