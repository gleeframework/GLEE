"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us – it's well below its true market value, and it gives you a significant profit margin.  I'm confident you'll find this offer very attractive. Let me know your decision, as I have another potential buyer ready to purchase it for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
