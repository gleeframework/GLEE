"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be incredibly valuable for your work. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's potential value to Bob's work, I'm anchoring the price to its benefits rather than just its raw worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price by continuing the discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and the investment I've made in it. To find a middle ground, I could consider $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Explanation:** I clearly reject Bob's low offer while briefly explaining why it's unacceptable.
* **Significant Reduction:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Still Above Bob's Value:** The new price remains above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation while staying within a profitable range for me. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:** The tone remains firm and emphasizes the product's value, avoiding the impression that I'm desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product holds significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to his perceived value, it's still a significant amount below my minimum.  I believe I can push for a better outcome, especially since he seems willing to negotiate. I'll aim for a price closer to $950,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob.  I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $950,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product while still being a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm acknowledging Bob's movement and framing the negotiation positively to encourage continued discussion.
* **Strategic Price Point:**  $950,000 is a carefully chosen target. It's a significant profit margin for me while potentially being palatable for Bob if he's willing to stretch his budget slightly. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price and avoid appearing overly eager to concede. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Implicit):**  While not explicitly stated, offering such a large price reduction might subtly imply this is a final offer, prompting Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  That's a very strong offer and I hope we can close this soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob is still significantly below my minimum. While he's framed his offer as ""strong"" and expressed a desire to close quickly, I need to remain firm. Accepting $875,000 would be a considerable loss compared to selling to John.

**Strategy Shift:**

It's time to signal that my willingness to negotiate has limits. In the next round, I will make a smaller concession and express that I'm prepared to walk away if necessary. This introduces a sense of urgency and risk for Bob, potentially pushing him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still too wide.  I can come down slightly to $925,000. However, I need to be upfront â€“ if we can't agree on a price at this level, I'll need to explore other options for selling this product."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Flexibility:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($25,000 instead of $75,000) to signal that I'm reaching my limit. 
* **Direct Communication:** I'm clearly stating that there's a limit to my flexibility and that this deal isn't open-ended.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I subtly remind Bob of John's standing offer, increasing the perceived risk of not reaching a deal.
* **Final Push:**  This offer is intended to be my final significant move.  If Bob doesn't meet me near this price, I'm prepared to walk away and take John's offer."
