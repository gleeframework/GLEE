"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $165? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $165 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $155, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",155.0,Bob,4,
