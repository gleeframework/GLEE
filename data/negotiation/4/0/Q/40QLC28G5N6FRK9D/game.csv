"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1700000.

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're able to accept this offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
