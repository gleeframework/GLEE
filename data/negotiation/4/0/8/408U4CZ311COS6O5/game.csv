"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the research I've done on similar products in the market.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $780000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your initial price.  I'm eager to make this deal work, so let's see if we can find common ground.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $780000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $795000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm very close to my budget limit and can only offer $785000 at this point.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product and the concessions we've both made.  Let's make this deal happen!",785000.0,Bob,6,
