,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your offer, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Could you do $17,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the best I can do. Can you consider it?",14000.0,Bob,4,
