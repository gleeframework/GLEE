Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher offer of $1,500,000 aims to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price allows for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can potentially still secure a price higher than her minimum.
* **John as a Backup:** Alice has the security of John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000.  This knowledge allows her to be bolder in her initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a degree of risk. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk in this scenario."
