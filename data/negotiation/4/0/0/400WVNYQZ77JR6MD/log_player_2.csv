"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that I know will be very attractive to you.  My offer is $900,000.  This is a price that allows you to make a substantial profit while also giving me a fair return.  Consider this a unique chance to secure something truly valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
