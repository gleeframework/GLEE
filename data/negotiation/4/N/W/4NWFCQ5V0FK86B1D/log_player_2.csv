"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum price as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  $12,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is truly worth more. How about we meet halfway at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still only comfortable going up to $13,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible but also recognizing that Alice is willing to negotiate. Offering $13,000 shows a willingness to compromise while staying within Bob's price range."
