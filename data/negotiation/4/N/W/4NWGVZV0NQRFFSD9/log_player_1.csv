Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not selling below your own value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a clear incentive to negotiate down to a price that's still profitable for you. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting with a high offer can scare off buyers.  

Remember, you can always counteroffer Bob if he rejects your initial price, and you have a fallback option with John if you need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, you still have room to negotiate with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, you show that you're willing to hold out for a better price. You'll likely be able to get closer to your target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
