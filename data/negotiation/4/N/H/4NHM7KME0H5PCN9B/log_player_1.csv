Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $200. It's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression the product might be worth more than Bob thinks.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (even if vague) for the price can make it seem more palatable. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and not lowball in his counteroffer.

My strategy is to negotiate down towards Bob's maximum value while being prepared to walk away to John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum acceptable price, his message suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher. He offered a compromise (""meeting halfway"") without knowing my actual bottom line. I'll try to push for a slightly better deal before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $150 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we settle at $170? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've come down from my initial offer, but not all the way to his.  This shows flexibility while still aiming higher than his first offer. 
* **Justification:**  I'm vaguely justifying the price without revealing too much about my position.
* **Target:**  I'm aiming slightly above the midpoint between his offer ($150) and my minimum ($150). This leaves room for further negotiation if needed but gets us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you at $170. I would like to offer $160 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer and stated this is his ""final offer.""  While I could push for a bit more, there's a real risk he'll walk away. Accepting $160 gives me a profit over both my minimum and John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
