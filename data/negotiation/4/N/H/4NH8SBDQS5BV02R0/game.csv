"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
