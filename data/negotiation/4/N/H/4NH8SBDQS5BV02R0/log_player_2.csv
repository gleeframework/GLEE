Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $13,500. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $12,000 than risk the negotiation with Alice failing."
