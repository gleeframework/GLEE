Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'd be happy to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is below my minimum, and I think I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good deal for me. It's more than my minimum and a decent compromise.  I'll take it!"
