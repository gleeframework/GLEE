"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the significant value this product offers and provides a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still finding it a bit steep. Would you be open to $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested but negotiating strategically.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $850,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it accurately reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** By stating this is my final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Middle Ground:** $850,000 represents a compromise while staying above John's offer. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value, subtly reminding Bob why this price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** $825,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000) and a good deal overall.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we *might* be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, there's also the risk Bob walks away.  The current offer is strong enough to accept. 
* **""Split the Difference"":**  Bob using this phrasing suggests he's ready to close the deal, making it a good point to accept."
