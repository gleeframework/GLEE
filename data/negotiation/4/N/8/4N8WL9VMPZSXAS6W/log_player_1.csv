Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. I think it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $149 is just below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers while still ensuring I make a good profit if he accepts.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the value proposition for Bob, aiming to persuade him to accept the offer."
