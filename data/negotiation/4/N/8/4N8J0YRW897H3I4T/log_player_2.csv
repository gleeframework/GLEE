{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but there is still room to negotiate. Bob is willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get a better price. There is also a chance that Alice will eventually accept a price closer to Bob's desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14250} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is raising his offer slightly from the previous round, but is still below Alice's current offer. This shows a continued willingness to compromise and signals a potential deal in the next few rounds. It also puts some pressure on Alice to consider the offer before getting too close to Bob's maximum price."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's maximum price. There are only three rounds left, and the likelihood of getting a better price from Alice is low. Given the limited time and the close price, it's more sensible for Bob to buy from John. This ensures he gets the product within the allotted rounds and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Alice."
