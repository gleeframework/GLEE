"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth and your potential interest, I propose we start our negotiation at $95. This allows us some room to adjust based on your feedback and preferences. Let me know if this sounds reasonable or if you have an alternative suggestion.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. I'm happy to pay $85, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
