Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a price point that is above Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but still offers him a potential gain. This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer. 
* **The message** establishes a friendly tone and highlights the potential value for Bob. 
* This initial offer is a starting point. It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and then adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I can either lower the price slightly or use the potential sale to John as leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $12,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $14,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and explaining why it's unacceptable while also emphasizing the value of the product.  
* **Decision:** By making a counteroffer, I'm continuing the negotiation, showing that I'm willing to find a solution. However, I'm not giving up on my desire to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I understand the value, but $12,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell the product for anything less than $12,500. I believe I can potentially push for a higher price. 

By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to find a compromise closer to my desired price. I also have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this transaction."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $12,000.  This is a slight compromise from my previous offer of $12,500 but still above Bob's latest offer. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, highlighting the value of the product, and suggesting a finalization of the transaction.
* **Decision:** I'm trying to  push Bob towards a more favorable price, but I'm also acknowledging the need to compromise. This counteroffer is my final attempt to strike a deal with Bob before potentially selling to John."
