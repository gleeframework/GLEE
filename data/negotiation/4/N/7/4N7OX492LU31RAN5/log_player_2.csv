"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $110. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We should try to negotiate a better price with Alice, as her initial offer is quite high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price and even our own budget limit.  A lower starting point gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Specific Counteroffer:** Offering a specific number helps move the negotiation forward more efficiently than just saying ""lower."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $97.5? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $97.5 is still significantly higher than both our target price and her product valuation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have enough rounds left to continue negotiating and try to get closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer to demonstrate willingness to compromise but are still significantly below Alice's offer.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the counteroffer (""fair price"") can make it more persuasive.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:** We're aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
