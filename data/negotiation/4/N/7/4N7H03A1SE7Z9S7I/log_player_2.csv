"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice's value is $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially get a lower price from her or from another seller."
