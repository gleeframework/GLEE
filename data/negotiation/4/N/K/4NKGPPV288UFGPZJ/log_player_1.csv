"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is immense, and I believe it would be a perfect fit for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initial price"" signals my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me leverage and a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would allow us both to secure a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my target price and only slightly above my guaranteed sale price with John. I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob.  We are early in the negotiation process, and I'm willing to leverage my position and time to aim higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my offer to $1,110,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've made a significant concession from my initial offer, moving closer to Bob's price. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the still-high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the price comfortably above my guaranteed sale price with John, allowing me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,110,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems anchored to his $1,050,000 offer. While it's above my guaranteed price with John, I still believe the product holds more value for Bob. I'll make one more strategic counteroffer before considering John or a more significant price drop."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position and want to see this deal through.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,080,000? This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my genuine desire to do business with you."",
""product_price"": 1080000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer splits the difference between our current positions, signaling my willingness to make a final concession to close the deal.
* **Limited Time:** By emphasizing my desire to ""see this deal through,"" I subtly introduce a sense of urgency without being aggressive.
* **Above Reserve:** The price remains comfortably above my fallback option with John, ensuring a reasonable profit.

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a favorable price and avoiding a stalemate that might lead Bob to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  While $1,080,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,065,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and his latest offer of $1,065,000 is a reasonable compromise. 

* **Strong Profit:**  This price still nets a $65,000 profit over my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield significantly better results and could risk alienating Bob. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting this offer demonstrates goodwill and could lead to positive future interactions with Bob. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains seem outweighed by the risks of delay and potential deal breakdown."
