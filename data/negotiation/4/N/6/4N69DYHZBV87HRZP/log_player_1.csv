"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and sets a clear expectation for a higher price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for a successful deal with Bob."

Round 2

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left and can continue negotiating with Bob to try and reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Sell to John as a Backup:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show my commitment to achieving a fair price."

```

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I have six rounds left and can continue negotiating with Bob. It's likely that we can close the gap with a few more rounds of offers and counteroffers.
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, selling to John for $1,200,000 is always a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm further reducing my price to $1,085,000, showing my willingness to find common ground. This is still above Bob's last offer, but it's a smaller gap.

```

**Reasoning:**
