Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,300,000 is a good offer, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm starting the negotiation with a strong position, and accepting this early would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** By stating this is my final offer, I signal firmness and push Bob to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** While I aim higher, meeting halfway shows a willingness to negotiate, making it more palatable for Bob.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are nearing the halfway point of our negotiation rounds, increasing the pressure for Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,325,000 represents a strong profit margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating a serious interest in the product.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob withdrawing completely, leaving me with John's lower offer. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
