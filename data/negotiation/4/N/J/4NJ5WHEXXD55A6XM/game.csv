"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves you with a good profit margin and represents a significant step closer to your goal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
