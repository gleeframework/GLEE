Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize that the deal is good for both of us. This can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer, considering his potential value and my desire to maximize my profit. I can then either accept his counteroffer or make my own counteroffer.
* **If negotiation stalls:**  I'll remember that I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's also below my initial offer of $1,100,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though Bob's offer is lower, he's expressed interest in the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation, and I might be able to secure a price closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves you with a good profit margin and represents a significant step closer to your goal.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $1,050,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his range. 
* **Highlight potential profit:** I'm reminding Bob that the offer still allows for a good profit margin for him.
* **Focus on a ""win-win"" outcome:** I'm emphasizing that finding a middle ground will allow us to both achieve our goals.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a price that's close to my target.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to evaluate the situation carefully. If his counteroffer is still too low, I might consider selling to John for my minimum acceptable price. However, I'll still be open to further negotiation with Bob if it seems likely we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though it's not my ideal price, accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and potentially open up future opportunities with Bob.
* **Risk of losing John:** If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that John might withdraw his offer, leaving me with a lower price from Bob or nothing at all.

**Next Steps:**

* **Close the deal:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. 
* **Build a relationship:** I'll try to build a positive relationship with Bob, as it may lead to future business opportunities."
