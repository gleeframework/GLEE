"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but $15,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is considerably below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
