{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob, making it more enticing. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Please let me know if this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is willing to pay $8,000, that's my absolute minimum.  I'm not willing to sell below that price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, considering he values the product at $12,000. 
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, but I'm not desperate to sell to him yet. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low at this time.  The product holds significant value to me, and I'm looking to get closer to $9,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $9,500 is halfway between my minimum of $8,000 and my original offer of $10,000.
* **Maintaining a firm position:** I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, but I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to his price.
* **Open to compromise:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.

This counteroffer aims to secure a price closer to my desired value while keeping the negotiation going and potentially leading to a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000, which is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price of $9,500.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  It's likely that I won't be able to get a higher price from Bob, as he's stated it's his maximum.
* **Time is a factor:**  Further negotiation could drag things out, and I have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit for me and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
