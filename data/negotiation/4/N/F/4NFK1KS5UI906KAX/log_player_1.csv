Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $1,000) while still giving you a significant profit margin. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. If Bob rejects the $14,000 offer, you're still guaranteed a reasonable profit."
