"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great deal, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price that's only slightly above its worth to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,1,
