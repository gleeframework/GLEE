"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great deal, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price that's only slightly above its worth to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
