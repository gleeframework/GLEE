"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm going to stick with my initial offer of $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
