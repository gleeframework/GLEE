"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to me. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us. If you're not interested, I'll be forced to consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",15500.0,Alice,5,
