Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your intent to negotiate. It also leaves room for Alice to counter if she feels it's too low.
* **Strategic pricing:**  $1,200,000 is still a good profit for Alice, and it leaves you with a comfortable margin.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and set the stage for further negotiation."
