"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Alice's offer is too high.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice's offer of $875,000 is still higher than Bob's preferred price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.  It's a fair compromise that allows Bob to save a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures a deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations."
