Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 places it significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers a substantial discount compared to what John is willing to pay.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The message subtly implies scarcity and urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously without revealing your guaranteed sale to John.

**Outcome:**

This strategy aims to achieve one of two outcomes:

1. **Bob Accepts:** You earn a significant profit of $400,000.
2. **Bob Rejects:** You proceed with the guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000."
