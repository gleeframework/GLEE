"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value; however, I can't let it go for less than $17,000. This product offers significant long-term value that I'm confident you'll benefit from.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given our respective values.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
