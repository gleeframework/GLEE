Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $125 offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a profit for Alice if he accepts.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering it at $125, Alice positions the product as potentially more valuable than Bob's $100 valuation.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing she can sell to John for $150."
