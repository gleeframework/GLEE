"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You can offer a lower price and see if she'll accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a lower price,  $13,500 is a good deal considering Alice's previous offer and the fact that John is selling for $12,000. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
