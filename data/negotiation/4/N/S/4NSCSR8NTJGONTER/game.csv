"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll counteroffer at $1025000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
