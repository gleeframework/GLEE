Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $140 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $100 = $50) between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, as it provides him with a perceived discount while still maximizing your potential profit."
