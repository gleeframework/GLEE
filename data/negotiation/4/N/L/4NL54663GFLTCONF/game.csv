"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 was a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still a bit much for me.  How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and what I've already offered. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $14,000.  If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to pass.",14000.0,Bob,6,
