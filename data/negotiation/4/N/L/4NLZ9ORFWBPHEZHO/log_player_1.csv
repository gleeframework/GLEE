Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile. Let's try $1,125,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. Can you consider this revised offer?

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, given the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiating. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and it seems like we're at an impasse. While I'm still aiming for a higher price, I don't want to risk losing a potential buyer completely. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safer option at this point, as it guarantees a sale and allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth."
