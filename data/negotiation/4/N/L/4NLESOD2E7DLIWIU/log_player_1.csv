Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise. This allows you a decent profit, while staying within my budget.  Let's work towards a deal.
