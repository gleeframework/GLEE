"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm still interested in purchasing it, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,380,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,320,000, so I'll offer $1,335,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1335000.0,Bob,4,
