Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (the difference between what Bob values it at and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that profit margin as possible, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves Bob with a potential profit of $150,000 if he were to utilize the product for its full value.
* **Confident Language:** The message uses phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" to subtly emphasize the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, you've left room to negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates, while still staying above your minimum. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know *why* Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Understanding his motivations could give you an even stronger negotiating position.
* **One-Time Deal:** This assumes you're maximizing profit on a single sale. If there's potential for future business with Bob, a slightly lower price might build a stronger relationship."
