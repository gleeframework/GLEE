Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which is a significant amount for Bob but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This price gives me a good starting point and allows me to potentially compromise while still getting a good price.
* **John as Backup:** The existence of John as a buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me leverage, knowing I have a guaranteed fallback option.

I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate a price closer to my desired value. However, I'm also prepared to counteroffer or walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $820,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can potentially get a better price by counteroffering and continuing the negotiation. 
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  I know I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have the security of a backup plan. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price.  This will give me a better chance of getting closer to my target price while still keeping the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Pressure:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, it still puts pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired price.
* **Balanced Approach:** This counteroffer keeps a decent gap between my price and Bob's offer, allowing for further negotiation if needed.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which gives me a strong bargaining position. 

I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise and provides a good starting point for the next round of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer of $850,000 is better than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get. 
* **Negotiation Remains Possible:** There's still potential for us to reach a price closer to my desired amount. I'm not giving up yet.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer.  I'll try to push for a higher price, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Push:** This counteroffer of $875,000 is a last attempt to get as close to my desired price as possible while still being reasonable. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This price represents a compromise where I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer of $850,000 and my previous offer of $900,000.
* **Selling to John as a Last Resort:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, but I'm making a final attempt to reach a deal with Bob before resorting to that. 

I believe this counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** It appears we've reached a stalemate. Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge much higher, and continuing to counteroffer is likely to lead to more back-and-forth with little progress.
* **John's Offer is Too Good to Pass Up:**  $1,000,000 is a very attractive price for the product, especially given how far Bob has been from my desired value.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  By selling to John, I guarantee myself a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a prolonged and unsuccessful process.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired value, selling to John at this point ensures a secure and profitable outcome."
