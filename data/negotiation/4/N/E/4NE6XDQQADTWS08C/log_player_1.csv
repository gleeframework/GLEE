Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000 vs. $8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond my minimum. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's interest. By saying ""I'm open to hearing your thoughts,"" I invite a counter-offer and start a dialogue. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a secure offer from John at $8,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
