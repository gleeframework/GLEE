Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm countering with $15,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to reconsider. I'm also trying to find a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already been through a few rounds of negotiation. It seems like he's unwilling to go higher, and I'm not sure I want to continue haggling.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000."
