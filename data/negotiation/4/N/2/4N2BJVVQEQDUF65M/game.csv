"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $135. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $135 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $130.  It's the most I can do, let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $132. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",132.0,Alice,5,
