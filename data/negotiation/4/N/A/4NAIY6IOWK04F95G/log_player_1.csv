{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects my offer. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message brief and professional, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. I'm not revealing my minimum price to give myself more leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also far lower than my initial offer of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get a better counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects the value this product holds for you. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with a price of $850,000. This is still above Bob's offer of $600,000, but it's a significant drop from my initial $1,000,000 offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone professional and reiterating the value proposition for Bob while highlighting the compromise I've made.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up in his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my minimum, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value this product holds for you.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with a price of $775,000. This is a compromise between Bob's latest offer of $700,000 and my previous offer of $850,000.  
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message short and firm, stating that this is my final offer. I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to make the price more appealing."
