# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [product description] for a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a significant value for you, considering the potential benefits you stand to gain. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
