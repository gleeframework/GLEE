Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better price:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($125) and my previous offer ($175).
* **Still profitable:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Enthusiastic tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to motivate Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $130? I'm confident we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, $130 is still below the $150 I can get from John. 
* **No room for further negotiation:** I've already made two concessions, and I don't see much chance of getting Bob to go higher. 
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and avoids any further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price.

It's a better strategy to secure the guaranteed profit from John rather than risk a continued negotiation with Bob that may not yield a better result."
