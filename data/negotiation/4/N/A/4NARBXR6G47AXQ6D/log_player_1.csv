"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the conversation at $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Positive Tone:** I want to establish a collaborative, rather than adversarial, negotiation atmosphere. The language is positive and emphasizes mutual benefit. 
* **Leaving Room for Discussion:** I avoid being overly aggressive and leave space for Bob to respond and counter-propose. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while maintaining a positive relationship with Bob throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. After evaluating its value, I believe a fair price would be $1,200,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll aim for a slightly higher price before accepting his offer or resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we settle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and making a concession to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:** I'm aiming for a price that's roughly halfway between my starting point ($1,500,000) and his offer ($1,200,000). This keeps the negotiation moving while still pursuing a higher profit.
* **Simple Proposal:** By providing a single counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation straightforward and avoiding unnecessary complexity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the market conditions and the value of the product, I propose a price of $1,250,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 represents a $50,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a genuine interest in closing the deal.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small increase in profit isn't worth the risk of Bob walking away or the time it would take.  Accepting now secures a good deal."
