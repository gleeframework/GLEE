Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming high within the ZOPA is key. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:** The message starts by highlighting the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves you a significant profit margin while still being attractive to Bob. It's closer to his maximum than yours.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""fair deal"" and ""significant benefits,"" you subtly anchor the price to its value for Bob.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point ($1,000,000) is crucial.
* **Relationship Matters:** While getting the best price is important, consider if maintaining a good relationship with Bob has future value."
