"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit above my limit.  I'm happy to pay $12,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
