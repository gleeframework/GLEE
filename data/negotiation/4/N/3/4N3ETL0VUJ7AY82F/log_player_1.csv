"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I know you'll value it highly. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's just below Bob's estimated value, giving him a slight incentive to accept.  However, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is still a decent profit, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer of $140 in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still too low for me. How about $135? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a good value for the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
