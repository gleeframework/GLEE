Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

It's unlikely we'll get Alice much lower than $13,500.  Buying from John at $12,000 ensures we get the product within our budget and avoids further negotiation."
