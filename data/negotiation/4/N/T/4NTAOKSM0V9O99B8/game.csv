"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that respects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the true worth of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
