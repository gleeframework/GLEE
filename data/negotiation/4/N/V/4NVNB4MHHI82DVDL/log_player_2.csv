{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Even though the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, she's willing to sell it for $14,000. This is still a better deal than buying it from John for $15,000. 
* **Bob saves money:** By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $1,000 compared to buying from John."
