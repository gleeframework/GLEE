This offer starts the negotiation by proposing a price higher than your minimum value. This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers.  It also sets a clear baseline for the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

This is the best offer received so far and is higher than the guaranteed $10,000 from John. Accepting Bob's offer maximizes the profit at this stage."
