"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can you consider $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
