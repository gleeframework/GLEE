"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the return on investment you'll get."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  I'm confident you won't find this kind of value anywhere else."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me. $18,000 is still a bit high for my current budget. I'm thinking something closer to $11,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $15,000? That's a significant price drop and reflects my willingness to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to being able to make this work. How about $12,500? If we can agree on that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll meet the $15,000 threshold. Accepting his offer would be leaving money on the table.  It's time to move on to John who's offering a guaranteed $15,000."
