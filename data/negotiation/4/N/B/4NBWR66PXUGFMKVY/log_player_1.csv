{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, I'm aiming for a slight profit.  I'm confident that Bob will find the value in the product and be willing to negotiate.  If he rejects the offer, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While it's tempting to take the $9,000, I'm confident I can do better.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  If he's truly interested, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer,  $9000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price, and I'm willing to work with you to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get $10,000, I'm willing to accept this offer.  It's a good compromise and I'm confident that I can still make a decent profit from the sale."
