I'm willing to offer you the product for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.,1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1080000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1060000 is the maximum I can go. What do you think?",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1100000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer you the product for $1090000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I think that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
