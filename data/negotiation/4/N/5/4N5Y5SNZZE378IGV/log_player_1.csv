I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows for some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his range might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could continue to counteroffer, it seems clear that he's not willing to pay what the product is worth to me.  It's better to sell to John at this point and guarantee a profit."
