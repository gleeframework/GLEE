,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $145 is still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $135. I think this is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. Let's close this deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
