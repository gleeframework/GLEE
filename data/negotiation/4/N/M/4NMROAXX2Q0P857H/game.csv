"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, the  $1,100,000 price doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,130,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I hope we can find an agreement.",1130000.0,Alice,3,
