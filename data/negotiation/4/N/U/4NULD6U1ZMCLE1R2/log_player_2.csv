"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While Alice's offer is higher than Alice's own valuation ($8,000), it's still lower than the price you'd pay John ($10,000). 
* **Saving money is the goal:**  Accepting Alice's offer means you save $500 compared to buying from John."
