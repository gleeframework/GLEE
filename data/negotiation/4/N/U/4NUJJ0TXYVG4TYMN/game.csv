"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $12,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
