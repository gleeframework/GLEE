"I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can offer you a slight compromise at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
