``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but below your own, leaving room for negotiation if he rejects it. It also positions you as flexible and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm looking to save some money. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum valuation.  While I want to close the deal, I can't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your need to stay within budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $13,000. This price still represents a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum valuation, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a significant improvement over his initial offer and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
