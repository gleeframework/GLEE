Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $13,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially still landing within a price range very beneficial for me.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so anything above that is a win.  Offering at $13,000 significantly increases the potential profit compared to accepting John's offer outright. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome with Alice's interests in mind."
