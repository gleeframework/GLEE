"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $12000. Would you be willing to negotiate the price down to this amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can offer you a compromise at $14000, which is a $1000 discount from my initial offer. Is this something you'd be interested in?",14000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process. I can see you're serious about getting the product, but I'm not ready to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14500. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a good profit while accommodating your budget. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $13500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on a significant profit. I can offer the product to you for $14000, which is a $1500 discount from my initial offer. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. Considering your last offer, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Could you possibly lower the price to $13500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $14000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a final offer of $13750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",13750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice. Considering your efforts, I believe we can come to a reasonable agreement. Could you possibly lower the price to $13250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13250.0,Bob,10,
