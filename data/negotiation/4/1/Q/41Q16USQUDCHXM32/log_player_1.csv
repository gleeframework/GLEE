{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Value Highlighting:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the price and entice Bob.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  This phrasing adds a sense of urgency and importance to the offer.

By starting at $1,350,000, we leave space to potentially negotiate down slightly while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price."
