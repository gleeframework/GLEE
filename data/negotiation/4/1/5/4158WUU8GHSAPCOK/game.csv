"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $11,750?  I think that's a fair compromise.",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,750 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",12200.0,Alice,5,
