"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth $100 to you, and to make this a good deal for both of us, I'm offering it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer."
