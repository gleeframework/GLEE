"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also aware of John's offer, so I have a safety net if Bob is unwilling to meet my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. I believe this price is fair given Bob's counteroffer, and it keeps me closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $920,000 is a good deal.  We've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's getting closer to my minimum value.  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance we'll reach a stalemate, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $800,000.  This is a good opportunity to close the deal and secure a decent profit."
