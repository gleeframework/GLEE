"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
