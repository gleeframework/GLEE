Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value but still higher than your minimum.
* **Is a clear and concise offer:** It gets straight to the point and makes it easy for Bob to understand.
* **Is polite and friendly:** This can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

By setting a price higher than your minimum, you give yourself room to negotiate and potentially earn more than $80.  If Bob rejects this offer, you'll have to analyze his counteroffer and decide how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation would only yield a small increase in the price.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
