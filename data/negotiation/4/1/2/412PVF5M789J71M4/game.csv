"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000 on this product.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit far from your desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'll have to consider other options.  ",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  It's my final offer, and if we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options. ",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
