"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, given the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product to your business.  Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
