I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. This is a good starting point, and I'm ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, I'd rather see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep the price at $15000 if possible. Is there any way we could reach that figure?

Bob is firm on his $15,000 price, and I've already lowered my price once.  While I'd like to get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
