"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product. I'm sure it will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, just below the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's potential value. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to try and get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. We're nearing the end of negotiations, so I'm going to try to be assertive and see if I can close the deal with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,600. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to move on to other buyers. "", ""product_price"": 8600}
