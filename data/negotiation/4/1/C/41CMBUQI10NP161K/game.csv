"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value you've expressed.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
