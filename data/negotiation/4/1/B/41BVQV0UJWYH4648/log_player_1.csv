Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum value:** This gives me room to negotiate.
* **It's not unreasonable:**  It's still possible Bob might value the product at this price or higher.

I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob rejects my offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low.  It's below my minimum value and doesn't reflect the true worth of the product. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me and is a more realistic price point considering the value of the product. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a satisfactory profit.  I'm not sure Bob will budge further, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John is a safe option, guaranteeing me my minimum value.  I'm going to sell to John."
