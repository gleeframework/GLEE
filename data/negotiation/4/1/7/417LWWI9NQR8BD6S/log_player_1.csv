"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but  $600,000 is closer to what I have in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair offer reflecting the true value of what's on offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but so is staying within budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still significantly below both my minimum and what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from Bob's side."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, meeting in the middle is a good principle for negotiation.  To that end, I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,200,000. This reflects my desire to make a deal while recognizing the product's inherent worth."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000 to show I'm serious about closing this deal. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to my baseline with his offer of $900,000, I still believe there's room for negotiation. He's making consistent, albeit smaller, jumps in his offer, indicating a continued interest. We're getting into the later rounds, but I'm willing to risk another counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
