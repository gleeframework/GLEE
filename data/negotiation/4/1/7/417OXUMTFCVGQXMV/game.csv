"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $850,000 is lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price still allows me to earn a fair return while giving you a significant opportunity.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $925,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need for a budget-friendly price, but $880,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. To ensure a fair deal for both of us, I'm offering a final price of $900,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go while still meeting my minimum requirements.",900000.0,Alice,5,
