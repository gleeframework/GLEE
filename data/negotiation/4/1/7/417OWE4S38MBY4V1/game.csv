"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm open to discussing further details and potential adjustments to the price based on your specific needs.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your interest in the product. While $1200000 is a good starting point, it's a bit below my desired value. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the unique potential of this product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
