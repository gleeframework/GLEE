"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've highlighted, $600000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Given the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $450000.  This reflects a significant investment on my end and allows for room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",450000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. Given the value you see in the product and your offer, I suggest we aim for a price closer to the midpoint of our current positions. Therefore, I am proposing a price of $525000 for the product. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're comfortable with while still reflecting the value of the product.",525000.0,Alice,3,

This allows us to move forward with the transaction while ensuring we both get a satisfactory deal.",480000.0,Bob,4,
