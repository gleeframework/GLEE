"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it.",125.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $112.50 just yet. I can offer you $122.50, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close! I'm ready to close this deal today, but $118 is just a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $116.50? That's my final offer.",116.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $117, which is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",117.0,Alice,9,
