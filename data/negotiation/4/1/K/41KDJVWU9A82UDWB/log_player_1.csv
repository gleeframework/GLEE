Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $750,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $1,500,000, but selling to John guarantees that.  
* **Creating Value:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's valuation ($750,000) creates a strong incentive for him to buy. It's a win-win â€“ Bob gets the product for less than its worth to him, and we potentially avoid the need to go to John.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes a quick and potentially more profitable sale to Bob. However, there's always a risk Bob might reject the offer."
