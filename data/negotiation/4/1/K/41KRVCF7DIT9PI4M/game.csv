"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price still allows you to make a substantial profit while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen!",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your minimum acceptable price. Can we meet at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
