Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
