{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leverage his interest and potentially secure a better price.  I'm also emphasizing the value proposition to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you see your way to $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  It's better to secure the $10,000 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with less."
