"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This allows me some room to make this work, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
