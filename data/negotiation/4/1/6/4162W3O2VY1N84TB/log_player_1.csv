"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a clear invitation for Bob to respond, ensuring the negotiation continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's a chance I can push Bob closer to my target price with a counteroffer. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  I have 8 rounds remaining, which gives me time to explore negotiation without immediately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This allows me some room to make this work, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Logic:** My counter-offer is a clear compromise, meeting halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Urgency:**  The ""let's close this deal"" statement adds a subtle sense of urgency without being pushy.

**Goal:**

* I'm hoping to reach a price point that is closer to my desired outcome while still staying within a reasonable range for Bob. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward."
