Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to consider it seriously. How about $1000000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.
