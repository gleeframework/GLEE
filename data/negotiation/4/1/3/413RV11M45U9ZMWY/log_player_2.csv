"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $12,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $12,000
* **John's price:** $12,000

Since John is also selling at your maximum price, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John achieves the same outcome. This is because there's no benefit to buying from Alice at that price."
