"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exceptional product to you for $9,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price if you reject her initial offer. By rejecting, you're strategically aiming for a better deal without risking exceeding your $10,000 limit."
