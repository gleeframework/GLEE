{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially getting a good deal. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, but it's still worth considering.  However, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great price for you, and it's a fair deal for me.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I'm really interested in this product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  At this point, I'm concerned that further negotiation might drag out the process and I might not be able to reach my desired price.  Selling to John for $150 is the safest option, ensuring I get my minimum while minimizing the risk of a lower offer."
