"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to immediately accept.  Since you don't know the product's true value to Alice, there's a chance she might be willing to sell for less. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, I'm interested in exploring a slightly lower price point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate the price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial asking price and within your budget.  While there's always a chance you could negotiate further, it's likely she's reached a point where she's unlikely to budge much more.  Accepting her offer secures the product for a price that's good for you and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could ultimately lead to buying from John at a higher price."
