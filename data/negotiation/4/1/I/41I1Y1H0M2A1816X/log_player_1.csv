"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $145, which is closer to my minimum value ($150) than Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer as a great deal, hoping to make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Not too aggressive:**  $145 is a reasonable starting point, leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being completely lowballed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $145 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I have 8 rounds left and can counter with a slightly lower price.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:**  While $150 is my minimum, I could potentially get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand it's a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $138.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet halfway:** I'm counter-offering at $138, which is halfway between my previous offer of $145 and Bob's offer of $130. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive message:** I reiterate that this is a good deal for both of us and highlight the product's value.
* **Room for future negotiation:** $138 is still above my minimum, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still looking for a better deal, though. I'm willing to pay $135. Let's split the difference and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $135 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and I have 6 rounds left to potentially get even closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John is premature:** While $150 is a guaranteed sale, I believe I can still get a better price through continued negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate that. Let's meet in the middle. How about $137? This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 137}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm offering a slight concession from my previous offer of $138 to $137. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Fair price message:** I'm framing it as a ""fair price for both of us"", hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Positive closing:** I end the message with a positive statement about moving forward, hoping to create a sense of momentum towards a deal.

**Why not sell to John yet?**

* I'm still close to my minimum, and Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate.  There's a good chance I can get a higher price by continuing. 
*  Selling to John now means missing out on the potential for a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $137 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about $136? This would be a good compromise and allow us to finalize the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $136. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $136
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $136 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not at my desired price point.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, and we have 4 rounds left. It's likely I can squeeze out a few more dollars.
* **Selling to John is risky:** While $150 is guaranteed, I could potentially get even closer to that amount with Bob.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to make this happen. I'm willing to go down to $136.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 136.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm only lowering my price by a small amount (50 cents) to show I'm willing to be flexible but still maintain my value.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I emphasize the fairness of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive closing:**  I use positive language to encourage Bob to accept and move forward. 

**Why not sell to John yet?**

* I'm still above my minimum, and we're nearing a potential agreement. There's a good chance I can close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my minimum than John's offer.
* Selling to John now would mean missing out on the potential for a slightly better price with Bob."
