,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to counteroffer at $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 is a fair price, I know the true value of this product goes beyond that.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle from my previous offer of $15,000, at $16,250?",16250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. To be honest, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $16,250 is pushing my limit. Let's close this deal at $17,000 even.  It's a win-win!",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17,000, which would be $16,500. I think that's a fair price for the product.",16500.0,Bob,6,
