"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a fair price considering its value and quality.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $135. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",128.0,Bob,6,
