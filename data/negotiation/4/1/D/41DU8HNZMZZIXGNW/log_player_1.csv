Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, the offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).  Even though I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm at risk of losing a deal altogether.  It's a calculated risk to accept, as I could potentially get a better offer in the next round but risk losing the buyer entirely."
