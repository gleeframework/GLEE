"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1200000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire this product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000.  You can get the product for the same price from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense as you have a guaranteed alternative at the same price."
