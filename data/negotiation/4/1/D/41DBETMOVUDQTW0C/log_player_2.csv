Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $11500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $11000, which is $11500. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

This is the closest Alice has come to your desired price. While $11,500 is still above your initial target, it's a good deal considering you can buy from John for $10,000.  You're running out of rounds, so it's better to secure the purchase now than risk losing out on the product altogether."
