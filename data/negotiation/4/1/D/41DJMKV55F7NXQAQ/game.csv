"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1000000 is getting closer, but not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
