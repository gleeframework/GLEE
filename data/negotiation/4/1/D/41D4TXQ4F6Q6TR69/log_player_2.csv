# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a steal considering its true value is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
