"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This offer reflects the unique advantages this product offers and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique advantages, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,280,000. I believe this recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your position.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
