"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe this product holds immense potential for your needs.  My initial offer is $2000000.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is unfortunately well above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the potential of the asset. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1750000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's a price that still reflects the product's potential.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects the potential of the product and is a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still below the value I place on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, but it's a price that still reflects the product's true potential. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
