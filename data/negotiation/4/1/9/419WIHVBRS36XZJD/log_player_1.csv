Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is unfortunately well above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the potential of the asset. Let's see if we can find a compromise.
