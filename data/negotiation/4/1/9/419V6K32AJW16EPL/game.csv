"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $700,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
