Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I know John is willing to pay that. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $80, I'm holding out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering Bob $95. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above his initial offer, and closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this price will be appealing enough to Bob without making him walk away."
