Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a significant profit while I still get a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000. This makes the offer attractive to Bob while still leaving me with a substantial profit. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the win-win potential of the deal. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a relatively high offer, I'm leaving room for negotiation while also aiming for a high initial profit. This approach allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, it gives me information about his willingness to negotiate.
* **Set the stage for counteroffers:** By starting high, I can then gradually decrease the price if needed, maintaining control of the negotiation.
* **Always have the backup plan:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the freedom to walk away from the negotiation if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. I'm choosing to reject the offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show my commitment:** It demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  This gives me control over the negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Explore options:** It allows me to consider other potential offers or even try a new approach in my counteroffer to Bob. 

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to achieve a good outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've offered $1,075,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. 
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's financial situation while emphasizing that the proposed price is a fair compromise and benefits both parties.

**Strategy:**

By splitting the difference, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my minimum.  This approach aims to:

* **Encourage agreement:** It demonstrates that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not completely accepting Bob's offer, I retain the upper hand in the negotiation.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** This counteroffer keeps the conversation going and increases the chances of a successful deal.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary. However, I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000, providing a safety net in case the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,075,000. I've carefully considered my budget and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. My latest counteroffer is $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my desired price and is above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  This is a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it. 

**Strategy:**

While I could continue negotiating, it's important to recognize the potential risks:

* **Stalemate:**  Bob might be unwilling to go higher, and we could get stuck in a loop of counteroffers.
* **Lost opportunity:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely it is that a better opportunity could arise for either of us.
* **Potential for John to back out:**  If I don't accept Bob's offer soon, there's a chance that John might change his mind or find a better deal.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision, as it ensures a profitable sale and avoids potential complications."
