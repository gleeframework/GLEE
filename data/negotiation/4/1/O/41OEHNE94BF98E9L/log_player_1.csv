Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115 offer:** This price is above Bob's perceived value of $100, giving him some room to negotiate, while still being profitable for Alice. 
* **Positive message:** Encourages Bob to consider the offer and avoids coming across as aggressive.
* **Option to sell to John:** Alice can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than nothing, Alice can likely get a better price.  She has a guaranteed sale to John for $120, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating. By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice signals that she's willing to walk away if she doesn't get a price closer to her desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $110:**  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and Alice's previous offer.
* **Reasoning:**  Alice provides a reason for her counteroffer, emphasizing the value Bob will receive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies Alice is willing to continue negotiating, but $110 is a strong starting point for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to Alice's minimum:**  $108 is only $2 away from Alice's minimum acceptable price of $110.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If Alice rejects this offer, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and Alice will be left with only John's offer, which is only $12 higher. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort without a guarantee of a higher price.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice at this point.  It ensures a sale, minimizes risk, and limits further negotiation."
