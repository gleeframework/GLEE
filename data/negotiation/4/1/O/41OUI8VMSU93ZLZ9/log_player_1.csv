Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth at least $15,000 in the open market, but I'm willing to part with it for $14,500."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($14,500) makes it appealing to Bob while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that you'll list it publicly creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
 
This approach balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
