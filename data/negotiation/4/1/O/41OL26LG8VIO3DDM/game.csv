"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price still allows you a good profit margin, and it gets me closer to my desired price. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $750,000? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is closer to your last offer and allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this, I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
