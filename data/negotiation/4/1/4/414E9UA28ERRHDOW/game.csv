"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant value it holds.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we bring it down significantly to something more reasonable?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers. However, your initial offer is a significant way off from where we'd need to be.  To move this forward, I can go down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but that price is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to make a more competitive offer, but it needs to be something that works for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to increase my offer again to demonstrate my commitment to making this work.  Would you be open to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000.  This is a substantial concession, and I believe it represents a very fair deal considering the value this product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big leap from where I need to be. To be frank, I have another offer on the table, but I'd prefer to work this out with you.  If you're willing to consider $1,250,000, I think we could close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're close.  I need to be realistic about this, and to get this done today, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I believe that's my absolute best, and I'm hoping we can close this deal now.",1450000.0,Alice,9,
