Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more push, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's price is increasing and she's unwilling to budge significantly from her last two offers. It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a price significantly better than John's offer of $1,500,000. It's time to cut losses and secure the product."
