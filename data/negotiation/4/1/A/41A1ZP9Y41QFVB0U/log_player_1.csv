Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible, while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out since you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John."
