"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you, and it gives me a healthy profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is enticing, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000.  That would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference - how about $1100000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $1,100,000 is a much better deal than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, accepting this offer is a good strategy to secure the product at a reasonable price."
