"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's fair considering the product's potential.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
