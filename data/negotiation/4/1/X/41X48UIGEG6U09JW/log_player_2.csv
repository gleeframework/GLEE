"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than the $10,000 John is offering, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice. There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me and is fair for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $8,500. Bob still has several rounds remaining to negotiate, so rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer might yield a better deal. It's worth noting that buying from John for $10,000 is still a backup option, but Bob is trying to maximize his savings and minimize his spending."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $8,750, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer and reflects the value I place on the product. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $9,100. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me and my minimum requirement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,100 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might become unwilling to compromise further and stick to her $9,100 offer.  Considering the time constraint (only 5 rounds left) and the availability of John's offer as a backup, accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is significantly lower than John's offer, making it a financially sound decision."
