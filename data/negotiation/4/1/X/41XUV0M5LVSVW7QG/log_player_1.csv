I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget. I also have the option of selling to John for $800,000 if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $800,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a substantial decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. I'll reject his offer and counter with another price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, showing I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  I think this is a fair price, considering Bob's last offer, and it gives him room to negotiate if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that we're not going to reach a deal that satisfies both of us.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll choose to sell to him and avoid further haggling."
