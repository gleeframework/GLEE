"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business, worth at least $1000000.  I'm willing to let it go for $1050000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it will be a strong investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving himself $50,000."
