"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more to you, so I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. How about $95? This is a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that?,85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $90. I'm willing to be flexible, but this is really the lowest I can go. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $85 is a better deal for me. Can you meet me at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $89. This is really my final offer. If you're not willing to go up just a little bit, I'll have to go with John's offer.",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm close, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you meet me there?",88.0,Bob,8,
