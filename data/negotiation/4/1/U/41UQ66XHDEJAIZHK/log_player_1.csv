"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. My initial price is $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, it's below my minimum threshold of $150. I'll reject and try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160} 
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me, but also attractive to Bob.  $160 is a significant discount from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $155?  I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $155 is above my minimum threshold of $150 and it's a good compromise. I'm going to accept his offer."
