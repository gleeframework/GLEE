"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
