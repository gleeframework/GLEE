{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. It also demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible, while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  While it's closer than his initial rejection, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is at my minimum acceptable value.  While I would have preferred more, it's a good deal for me considering that John is also willing to pay $12,000. It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
