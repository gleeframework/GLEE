"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $700000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,
