Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $149. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is only worth $80 to Bob, I need to offer a price significantly lower than $150 to entice him.
* **John as Backup:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $150, I can be a bit bolder with my initial offer to Bob.

By starting high, but still below my guaranteed price, I leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
