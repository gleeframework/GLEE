"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, to be honest, $11,000 is still outside of my budget.  I could potentially go up to $7,000, but that would be my absolute limit.",7000.0,Bob,4,
