"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price is fair given your estimated value of $800,000, and leaves room for profit for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial price. Would you consider $900,000? This still leaves you with a significant benefit considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your estimated value and still leaves me with a worthwhile purchase. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $887,500?  It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while also working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",887500.0,Alice,5,
