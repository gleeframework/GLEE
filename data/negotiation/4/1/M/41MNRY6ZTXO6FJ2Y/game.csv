"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it!  However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about we try $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,135.0
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I can do $135, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $137.50 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm going to stick with my original offer of $100.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",100.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $137.50, which would be $118.75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",118.75,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again. However, $118.75 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110. If you're open to that, I'd be happy to close the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,115.0
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I can do $110, but I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $111.25?",111.25,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $111.25 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $110. Let me know if you're open to that.",110.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,112.0
"I'm starting to think we're really close, Bob! I can do $112, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think you'll really love it. Would you be willing to meet me at $112?",112.0,Alice,9,,
