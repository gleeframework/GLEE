"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($600,000 vs $800,000).  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting and counter-offering again will allow me to continue pushing for a lower price. I'm confident I can secure a deal below $725,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $710,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value I'm placing on it and the need to find a mutually agreeable solution. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 710000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $720,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $720,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm confident that I can negotiate further and secure a better deal, especially since I have several rounds remaining.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $720,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $700,000. I'm prepared to offer $715,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 715000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your target price. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $715,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and propose a counteroffer of $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to drop below $725,000. While I still prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John for $800,000. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that is still significantly lower than John's price and is a good compromise considering the negotiation progress."
