"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($70), we're aiming to see how much Alice is willing to move on price.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a polite and interested tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, our alternative is to buy from John at $100. Any price we can negotiate below that is a win."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $95 is my initial offer, I could meet you halfway at $85.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, we're still aiming to get closer to $80 (or even lower!). Since we have some wiggle room before hitting John's $100 price, it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $75?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the deal if you are."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price that splits the difference between our previous offer ($70) and Alice's counteroffer ($80). This shows we're willing to move towards her price but still signals we're looking for a good deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding ""I'm ready to make the deal"" aims to add a bit of urgency, potentially encouraging Alice to accept.
* **Still Below John:** We're still comfortably below John's $100 asking price."
