Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language to highlight the product's value and make Bob more receptive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially counteroffer. 

This approach balances my desire for a good price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, his willingness to negotiate shows there's still potential for a deal.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can make a counteroffer to try to reach a price that is more favorable for me.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the chance to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? This would still give you a great deal, and I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while still trying to secure a price closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to reinforce why $140 is a good price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, $125 is still below my acceptable range.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has indicated he's unlikely to go higher, making further negotiation unlikely to yield a better price.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a significant profit and exceeds Bob's highest offer.

Given the circumstances, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale at a profitable price."
