"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value for me, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still leave you a good amount of value, and it's a price I can feel comfortable with.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is still well within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has successfully brought the price down from $12,000. Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of time is higher. 
* **Risk:** Buying from John carries a higher risk of overspending and potentially missing out on a better deal with Alice.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 is the most sensible decision for Bob to maximize savings while minimizing risk."
