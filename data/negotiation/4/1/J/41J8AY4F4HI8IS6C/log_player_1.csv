Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Motivating Language:** I'm using positive and encouraging language to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob break down, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price and leaves me with a much lower profit. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John right now guarantees my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to take a calculated risk by continuing negotiations with Bob.  If I can increase his offer, I'll potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $900,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer of $1,050,000, which is a compromise but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  
* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while also keeping my profit margin reasonable. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive and conciliatory language to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Looking for a Win-Win:** I emphasize that I want a solution that benefits both of us, reinforcing the idea of a fair and mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my ideal price. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not convinced I can get a better offer from Bob.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations would require more time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John guarantees me the minimum acceptable price and avoids further potential losses from negotiation. 

**Conclusion:** Although I'd prefer to get a higher price, minimizing risk and maximizing profit in this situation means selling to John."
