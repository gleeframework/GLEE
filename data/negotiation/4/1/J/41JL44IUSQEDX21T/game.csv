"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's uniqueness. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I understand the value in the product, I am still unable to meet you at $1200000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose $900000 as a fair compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000.
