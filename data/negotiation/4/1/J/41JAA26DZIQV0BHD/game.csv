"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its value, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  What do you say? ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $900,000? This allows for a healthy profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $875,000 at this point.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
