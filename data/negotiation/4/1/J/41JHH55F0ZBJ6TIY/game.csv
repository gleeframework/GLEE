"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $12000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000.  I'm very interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11500. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, I'm not ready to give up on the value I know this product can bring. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, which is a bit closer to my initial offer. This is still a great deal, considering the benefits the product offers. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
