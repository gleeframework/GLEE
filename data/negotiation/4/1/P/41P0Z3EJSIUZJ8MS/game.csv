"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I could go up to $7,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can do.  If we can make a deal at that price, I'm ready to buy today.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to compromise further. My counteroffer is $13,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
