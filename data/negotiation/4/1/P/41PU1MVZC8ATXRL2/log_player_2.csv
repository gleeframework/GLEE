"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you as it's significantly below what it's worth to you, and it allows me to get a good price as well.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your limit:**  $1,400,000 is more than the $1,200,000 you're willing to spend.
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $1,200,000, which meets your budget. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate a better price or simply buy from John and save $200,000."
