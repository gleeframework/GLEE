"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,075,000 is closer, I still need a bit more to make this work for me. Let's try $1,125,000.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value for the product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
