"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. It's a steal considering its value to you!  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than Bob's maximum price, there's room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will be willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal. He knows the product is worth more to him than Alice, but he's also aware that he can buy it from John for $150 if negotiations with Alice fail. A $100 counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and while $110 is higher than his initial counteroffer, it's still a good deal for him.  He values the product at $150, and $110 is significantly less than that.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a few dollars in savings."
