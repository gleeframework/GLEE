"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been developing for a while, and I think it has the potential to really benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
