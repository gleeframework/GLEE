Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you at a special price.  I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $13,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity for you to get a great deal on something that could really benefit your business.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, making it attractive to Bob.
* **Message:**  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, emphasizing the potential benefits and the ""special price"" to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Back-up Plan:**  I'm aware that I can get $15,000 from John, so I'm comfortable with a lower price as long as it's above my minimum threshold. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while recognizing that Bob's willingness to pay is lower than John's."
