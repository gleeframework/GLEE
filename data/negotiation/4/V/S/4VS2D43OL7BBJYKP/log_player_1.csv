{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still gives him room to negotiate.  It also positions the offer as fair and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that leaves me with less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $92.50.  This would be a great deal for you, and it gets us both closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $88.50. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price with Bob, it's still not enough.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
