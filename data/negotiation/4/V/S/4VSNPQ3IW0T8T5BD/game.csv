"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $95 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and it fits within my budget. Let me know what you think!",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $90?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $88?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase at this point.",88.0,Bob,4,
