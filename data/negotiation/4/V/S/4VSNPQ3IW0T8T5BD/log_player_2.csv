"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as the product is worth less to you than her asking price.  You can likely get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $95 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and it fits within my budget. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $90?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit more.  I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."
