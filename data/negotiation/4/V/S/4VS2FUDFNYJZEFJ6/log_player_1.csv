Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" aims to frame the product's worth in a way that resonates with Bob, potentially shifting his perception of its value.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing for a more assertive negotiation strategy.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a potential rejection from Bob, knowing she has a guaranteed sale to John.
*  Bob's risk tolerance and negotiation skills are unknown factors that could influence the outcome."
