"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair return. How about $1,300,000? This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a strong compromise that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? I think this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
