,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth the $95 you're asking for. Can you meet me in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I am willing to consider your offer, but I would need to adjust the price slightly to $89. This reflects the value we place on the product and the costs involved. Would this be acceptable to you?",89.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $89. I'd like to try to find a price that works for both of us. Can you meet me at $85? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let me see what I can do. Considering the value of the product and the market conditions, I am willing to sell the product for $86. This is my best offer, as it balances the cost of the product with the value I believe it holds. Please let me know if this meets your expectations.",86.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $86. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. Can you meet me at $82? I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement.",82.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product for $84. This is my final offer, as it reflects the value of the product while also considering the current market conditions. I hope this meets your requirements and allows us to reach an agreement.",84.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $84 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $83. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",83.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product for $83.50. This represents a slight compromise from my last offer and I believe it strikes a fair balance between the value of the product and the market conditions. I hope this final offer meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",83.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the slight concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $83.50. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'd like to propose $82.50. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $100.",82.5,Bob,10,
