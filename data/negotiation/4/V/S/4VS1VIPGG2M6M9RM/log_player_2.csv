"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is less than what Bob would pay John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  
* **Counteroffer Logic:**  A counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price.
* **Strategic Consideration:**  By offering $1,050,000, Bob is testing the waters and seeing how much Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Cost:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than what Bob would pay John ($1,200,000). 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob might be able to squeeze out a bit more, it's unlikely that Alice will drop much further. The risk of further negotiation is that Alice could walk away, leaving Bob with no product and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further delays or a higher cost."
