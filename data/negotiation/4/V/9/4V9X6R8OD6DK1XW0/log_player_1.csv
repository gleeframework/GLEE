""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a special price of $11,500. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $1,500.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a price point that still benefits Bob (saving him $500 compared to his perceived value) while providing you with a significant profit margin. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not explicitly mentioning John, you subtly create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly before the opportunity is gone."
