Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed offer creates room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, it's the best strategy to maximize your potential earnings before accepting the guaranteed $150 from John."
