# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. With that in mind, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?
