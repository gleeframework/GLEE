"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. With that in mind, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. My next offer is $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. While $975,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and it's also within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",925000.0,Alice,7,
