"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still allows you to make a significant profit. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good value for my money.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still giving me a reasonable return on my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
