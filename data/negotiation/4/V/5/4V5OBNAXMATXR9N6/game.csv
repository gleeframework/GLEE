"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I hope you'll consider it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go below $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $16,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant step from my initial offer. I hope you'll consider this as we both try to make this deal work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to stay above my minimum of $15,000. How about we meet at $14,500? This is a fair price that I think reflects the value you'll get from the product.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have a minimum price, but $14,500 is still stretching my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $13,500. It's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $15,000, which would be $14,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,7,
