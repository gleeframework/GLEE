"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It makes no sense to accept this offer.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go below $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob shouldn't settle for a price that's too high.  He should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $16,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant step from my initial offer. I hope you'll consider this as we both try to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to stay above my minimum of $15,000. How about we meet at $14,500? This is a fair price that I think reflects the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $14,500 is still over Bob's budget. He has a safe alternative with John, so it's not worth taking the risk of agreeing to a price that's still too high.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a minimum price, but $14,500 is still stretching my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $13,500. It's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $15,000, which would be $14,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice has come down to $14,250, Bob is still very close to his maximum budget and the risk of going over it is too high. At this point, it's wiser to buy the product from John for $12,000. John's price is within Bob's budget and guarantees a successful purchase without any further negotiation."
