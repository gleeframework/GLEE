"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price that's fair to both of us. I know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and while I value it at no less than $800,000, I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This price allows you a significant profit while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Consider this a win-win situation.  Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,1,
