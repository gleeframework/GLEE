"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price that's fair to both of us. I know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and while I value it at no less than $800,000, I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This price allows you a significant profit while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Consider this a win-win situation.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John is asking for $1,000,000. 
* **You are still getting a good deal:**  You are getting the product for a price significantly lower than your maximum budget ($1,000,000) and less than what it's worth to you ($1,000,000). 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision."
