"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree this product is a great fit for my needs, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to considering $925,000? That would make this a viable deal for me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
