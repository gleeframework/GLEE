"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's find a compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
