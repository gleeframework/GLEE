"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a product that would be extremely valuable to your business. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its significant value.  My offer is $950,000. This is a price that allows you to secure a substantial advantage while still ensuring a fair return for me.  Let me know your thoughts.  If you decide to pass, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
