Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers, say $110?

You have three options:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I have another buyer for $150, but I'd prefer to work something out with you.  My final offer is $125 - how does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand where you're coming from. While $125 is closer, I have a strict budget. If you're willing to come down a bit more, we might have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It seems unlikely he'll reach $150 in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
