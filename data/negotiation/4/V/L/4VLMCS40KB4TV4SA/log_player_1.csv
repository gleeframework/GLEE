"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This sets the stage for a negotiation and lets me see how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have more rounds and don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer. I believe Bob is genuinely interested in the product and will eventually come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now equal to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  While it would be ideal to get a higher price, accepting his offer guarantees me the $1,000,000 I need."
