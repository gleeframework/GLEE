Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $710,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $720,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you.
