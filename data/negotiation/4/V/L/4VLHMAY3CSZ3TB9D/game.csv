"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm not willing to go below $750,000.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $700,000. How about we try $725,000?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, and for meeting me halfway. To be honest, $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $710,000? I think that's a fair price that allows us both to benefit.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $710,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $720,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you.",720000.0,Alice,7,
