"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **Your Maximum Value:** $150
* **Alice's Minimum Value:** $120

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum value, it's still more than you'd like to pay. Since John is willing to sell for $150, you can wait and see if Alice is willing to lower her price to a more favorable amount."
