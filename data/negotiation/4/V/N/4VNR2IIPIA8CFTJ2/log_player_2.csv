{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both you and Alice, there's no immediate incentive to accept her offer. By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price.  You still have 9 rounds to achieve this before having to settle with John at the same price."

Round 2

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is within a reasonable range,  giving Alice room to counter without feeling overly pressured to immediately accept. You still have 8 rounds to negotiate, so you don't need to be overly aggressive with your initial counteroffer."

You've already made several counteroffers, and the remaining time is limited.  To ensure you acquire the product, it's more strategically sound to buy from John at $1,200,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it guarantees you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
