"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Buying from John for $15,000 is the worst-case scenario, so Bob should try to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's value for the product ($12,000) but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($14,000). This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a significant drop from her initial $14,000 offer and is only $500 above Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting this offer is a good deal for Bob as it's well below his maximum price of $15,000."
