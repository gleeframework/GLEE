"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, even at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John, as there's a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is way outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob needs to start with a significantly lower offer to signal his serious intent to negotiate.  
* **Reasonable Counter:** $8,500 is still above Bob's ideal price but leaves room for negotiation and shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This product is truly worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,000 is still too high for Bob. It's important to keep negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his ideal. Rejecting allows for another counteroffer, potentially bringing the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $11,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Bob is showing willingness to compromise by increasing his offer, but by a smaller amount. This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  Stating that the price is ""fair""  appeals to Alice's sense of reason and encourages her to see the benefit of agreeing. 
* **Staying Firm:**  Bob is still below his maximum price point, leaving room to potentially negotiate higher if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about $10,250? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to push for a lower price. He's also getting closer to his limit of 10 rounds, so there's a risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice. However, rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and potentially leads to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,250 is still above my limit.  I can offer $9,750, which is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Bob is now very close to his maximum price point, but still trying to get a better deal. 
* **Small Increase:**  He's increasing his offer by a smaller amount, showing a willingness to compromise while putting pressure on Alice. 
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  A positive and enthusiastic message encourages Alice to agree and close the deal."
