,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is way outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This product is truly worth it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $11,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about $10,250? This is my final offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,250 is still above my limit.  I can offer $9,750, which is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen!",9750.0,Bob,6,
