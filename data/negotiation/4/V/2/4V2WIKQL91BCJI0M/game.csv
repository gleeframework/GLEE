"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Considering the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $1,700,000.  This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
