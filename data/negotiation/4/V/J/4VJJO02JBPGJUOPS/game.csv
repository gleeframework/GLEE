"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable. I'd like to propose a price of $1400000. This is my top limit, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, $1400000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. Let's try $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be realistic about my finances. I'd like to propose a price of $1450000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1450000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1700000. It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm starting to feel like we're not on the same page. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I'd like to propose a price of $1380000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1380000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're feeling like we're not on the same page, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1380000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1600000, but I'm only willing to go this low because I think we're getting close to a deal. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to lose patience. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a serious concession. I'd like to propose a price of $1500000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
