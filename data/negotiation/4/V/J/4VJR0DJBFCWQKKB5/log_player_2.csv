# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $11,000? This offers a reasonable profit for us while still being within your perceived value range. I look forward to your consideration.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still slightly above your perceived value, but it's getting closer to your ideal price.  There's a chance you could get it down further, but you risk Alice walking away.  Given the potential for further negotiation, the $11,000 price is a good compromise."
