"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
