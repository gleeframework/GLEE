"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is a significant discount for Bob but still leaves me with a good profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, I create room for negotiation while still maintaining a strong starting position.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While $11,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to $12,000 or even $12,500. 
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to stand my ground. This can encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Time is on My Side:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have plenty of time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's offer while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that $12,000 is still a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone, fostering a cooperative atmosphere."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $11,500 is getting closer to my bottom line, I still believe there's room to push for a higher price.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting this offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate to close the deal and am willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will increase his offer further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference again, how about $12,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and avoiding an impasse.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but no higher. Can we meet at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Middle:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is a good compromise, meeting my counteroffer from the previous round. It's a fair price that secures a decent profit.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away or me needing to sell to John at a lower price outweighs the potential gain."
