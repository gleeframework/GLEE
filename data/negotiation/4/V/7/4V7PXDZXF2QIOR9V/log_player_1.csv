Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $200. I believe it's a great deal and you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $200 offers a significant markup from your minimum but isn't so high that it's likely to scare Bob away immediately.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down if he's interested but not willing to pay the full $200.  

This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price while still keeping the sale likely."
