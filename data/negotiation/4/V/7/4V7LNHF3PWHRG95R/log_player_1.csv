Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a great deal, given its value."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay up to $80 for the product, as I've seen it from another seller for that price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to budge above his perceived value of the product. Since I have a guaranteed offer of $80 from John, which matches my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
