"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit outside of what I can afford. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $100 is closer, I can't go that low.  My absolute bottom line is $120.  Take it or leave it.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but $120 is still a stretch for me.  How about we settle on $110?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
