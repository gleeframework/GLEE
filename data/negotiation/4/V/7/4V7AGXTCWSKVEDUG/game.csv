,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $120. Would you be willing to come down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $140, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $145. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $142, which is my final offer. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",142.0,Bob,6,
