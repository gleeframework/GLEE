"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price today.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's meet in the middle. This is my final offer.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $950,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",950000.0,Alice,5,
