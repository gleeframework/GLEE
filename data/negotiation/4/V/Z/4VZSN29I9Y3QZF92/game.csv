"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
