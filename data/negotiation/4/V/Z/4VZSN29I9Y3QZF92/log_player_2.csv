"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your ideal price point, but it's still a good starting point. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my desired price point of $850,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. I still have time and haven't reached my limit of 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go up to $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your original offer. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my ideal price point.  I'm committed to getting the product for as close to $850,000 as possible, and I still have time to negotiate. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000, which is closer to your last offer and still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go up to $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $915,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price point of $850,000.  While I'm getting closer to my goal, I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a slightly lower price. I've already rejected several offers, and it's clear that Alice is also determined to get the best deal. I have a few rounds left, so it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us and a better deal for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I'm not willing to budge any further, and I'm not going to sell the product for less than $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to compromise any further. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and Alice is being very firm on her price.  It's clear that we're unlikely to reach my desired price point of $850,000. With only one round left, it's not worth risking that Alice will reject my final offer and I'll be left with nothing. Buying the product from John for $1,200,000 is still within my budget and guarantees that I get the product.  While it's not the ideal price, it's a more secure option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
