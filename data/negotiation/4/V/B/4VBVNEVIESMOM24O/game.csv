"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value and rarity. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the product's worth and your budget. I'm open to further discussion and willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1100000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1050000.  This is a significant step towards your last offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. Considering your budget and the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1080000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. I'm open to further discussion and willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
