"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal compared to John's price of $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you and closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I need to maintain the value of our product. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $95 is a good compromise.  While Bob would ideally pay less, accepting this offer still saves him $25 compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable price point that balances saving money with ensuring a deal."
