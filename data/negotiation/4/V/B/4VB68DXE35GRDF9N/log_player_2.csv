"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. I know I can get it for a lower price, either by negotiating with Alice further or by going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Acknowledges Alice's offer:**  It's good negotiation etiquette to show you've considered the other party's proposal.
* **Expresses Interest:**  This keeps Alice engaged in the negotiation.
* **Offers a Compromise:** $85 is a significant drop from Alice's offer but still gives her a reasonable profit margin.
* **Provides a Rationale:** By suggesting ""meeting in the middle,"" we offer a simple and seemingly fair justification for the counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $85 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. How about we settle on $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, which is good, but $95 is still too high. I'll counter with a price closer to my target, but I need to be mindful that going too low might push Alice away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $95 is a little more than I had in mind. Could we do $90? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledge and Validate:** We again acknowledge Alice's counteroffer and her need for a fair profit.
* **Incremental Increase:** By offering $90, we show willingness to move from our previous offer but keep the increase moderate.
* **Reiterate Fairness:** We frame the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" subtly anchoring the idea that Alice is also gaining by agreeing.
* **Maintain Walk-Away Option:**  We're still comfortably below our maximum budget, leaving room to negotiate further or accept John's offer if needed."
