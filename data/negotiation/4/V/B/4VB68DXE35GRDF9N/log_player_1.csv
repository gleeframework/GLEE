Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $95 is a little more than I had in mind. Could we do $90? That seems like a fair compromise to me.
