"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. $85 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. How about we settle on $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $95 is a little more than I had in mind. Could we do $90? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
