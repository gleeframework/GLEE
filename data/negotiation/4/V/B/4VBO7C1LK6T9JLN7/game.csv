"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1800000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it,  which is still a significant profit for you considering its value to you is at least $1500000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1200000. This is still a significant profit for you, and it's the highest I can go. Let's try to make this deal work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
