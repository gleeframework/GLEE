Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $120.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer of $120 from John.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible from Bob. Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a small incentive to buy ($9 savings) while maximizing your potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have your guaranteed sale to John at your desired minimum price."
