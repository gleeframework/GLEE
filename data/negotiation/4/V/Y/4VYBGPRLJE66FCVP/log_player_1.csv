Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and you can still accept his counter if it's above your minimum.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it at $12,000 might be too high and cause Bob to reject it outright.  By starting a bit lower, you increase the chances of a successful sale."
