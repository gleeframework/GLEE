"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1300000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is above Bob's maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1150000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,250,000, which is still a bit higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  Bob is close to his limit, but John is still a viable option.  It's worth trying one more round of counteroffers to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,225,000.  This is a significant amount, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
