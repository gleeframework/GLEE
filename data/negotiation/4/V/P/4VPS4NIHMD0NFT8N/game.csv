"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1150000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $1225000.  This is a significant amount, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
