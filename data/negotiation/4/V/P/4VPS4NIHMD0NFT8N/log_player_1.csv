Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,150,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to consider a counteroffer closer to my initial price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.
