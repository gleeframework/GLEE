"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being more aligned with my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while ensuring a fair price for such a high-quality product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you want to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000, so I'm offering $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the full value of this product.  How about $1,550,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,520,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",1520000.0,Bob,6,
