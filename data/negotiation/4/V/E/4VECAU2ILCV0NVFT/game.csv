"I have a great deal for you on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll really love it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm firm at $120.  If you're not able to do that, I'll have to go with another option.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to compromise at $155. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
