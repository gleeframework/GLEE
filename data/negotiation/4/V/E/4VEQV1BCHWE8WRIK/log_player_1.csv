Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,600,000 is a good price, I believe I can get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,650,000 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get much higher.  It's important to weigh the potential of getting a better price against the risk of losing the deal altogether.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing Bob's interest."
