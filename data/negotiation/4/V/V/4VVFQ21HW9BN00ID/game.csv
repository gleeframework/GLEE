"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",137.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to come up a bit.  $132 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to a compromise.  How about we settle on $135? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
