"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its benefits, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $10,000. This is a significant markup. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation.  You can try to bring the price down closer to your target value. 
* **John is a backup:** You have a backup option in John, who will sell the product for $8,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I've offered $8,500, which is closer to my target price of $8,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I've explained my position, acknowledging the product's value but stating my financial constraint. 
* **Fair counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has moved closer to my price, $9,250 is still above my target of $8,000. 
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still room to negotiate further, especially since I have a backup option with John. 
* **Strategic approach:** Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $8,750.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:** I've moved closer to Alice's offer, but I'm still holding firm on my desire to stay below $9,000. 
* **Finding middle ground:** My offer represents a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from my previous offer.
* **Continuing the negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the conversation going and shows my commitment to finding a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. $8,750 is closer, but I need to be closer to $9,000.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:**  While Alice is getting closer to my target, $9,000 is still outside of my ideal range.
* **Room for compromise:** We're both getting closer to a possible agreement.  I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Continuing negotiations:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to accept $8,800?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant move:**  I'm offering a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise while staying within my budget.
