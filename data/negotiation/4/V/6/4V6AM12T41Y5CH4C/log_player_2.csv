# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering the value it offers, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. We believe this still allows us to cover our costs and achieve a fair profit. We look forward to your consideration.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still above my budget of $800,000. While it's closer to my limit, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm better off buying from John at $800,000 and securing the product without exceeding my budget."
