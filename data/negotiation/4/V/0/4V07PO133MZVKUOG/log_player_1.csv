Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000

We're still significantly above John's offer and Bob is clearly interested. Let's counter and see if we can push a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

This is a good spot to accept.  Bob is clearly motivated and we're getting a great price well above our fallback option with John.  Continuing to push risks losing the deal."
