"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you thinking of me, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $120?  That's my absolute top price for this product.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $120. I appreciate your honesty about your top price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $135. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe the product is still worth it. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",120.0,Bob,4,
