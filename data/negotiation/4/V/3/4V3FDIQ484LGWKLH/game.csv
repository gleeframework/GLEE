"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet at $110? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality and value.",110.0,Alice,5,
