Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. I believe in its value and know it can greatly benefit you. I'm willing to make this offer especially attractive to you. How does $790,000 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 790000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit while ensuring a deal:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, selling to Bob quickly and for a price slightly above his perceived value is advantageous. 
* **Strategic pricing:** Offering the product at $790,000 is just above Bob's perceived value, making it a tempting deal while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob, potentially pushing him towards acceptance."
