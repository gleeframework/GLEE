"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
