Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This ensures you're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's estimated value:** This gives him an incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can still potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, the key is to be confident, but also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! It's a nice product, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your minimum desired price of $10,000.  By rejecting this offer, you can:

* **Maintain your leverage:** This demonstrates you're not desperate to sell at any price.
* **Try to get a better deal:** You can counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more profitable outcome.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings. While selling to John is a guaranteed option, it's not the most lucrative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. How about $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would still leave you a good margin for profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at a loss. 
* **Still lower than your original offer:** This maintains a degree of flexibility and demonstrates a willingness to find a middle ground. 
* **Positive message:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and positions the offer as fair to both parties. 

By offering $12,000, you are increasing your potential profit while still being open to further negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is above your minimum desired price of $10,000 and closer to your initial counteroffer of $12,000. It's a good compromise and ensures you make a profit. 

Here's why accepting is the best option at this point:

* **Profitable deal:** You are securing a sale above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time efficiency:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to more rounds of back and forth, potentially wasting time.
* **Potential for risk:** If you reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a chance he might walk away, leaving you with only John's offer, which is lower. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you get a good price and ensure a sale without risking further negotiation delays or the possibility of a lower price from John."
