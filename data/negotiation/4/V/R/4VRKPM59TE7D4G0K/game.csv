"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work this out.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
