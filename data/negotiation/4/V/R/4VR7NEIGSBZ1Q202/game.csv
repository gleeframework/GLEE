"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is significantly higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $750,000, which still provides you with a substantial profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to secure the product within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $800,000? This would allow you to make a good profit and would fit perfectly within my budget. Let's try to finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
