"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is significantly higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $900,000, which is above your target of saving as much money as possible.  It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $750,000, which still provides you with a substantial profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to your goal, it's still above your ideal price point.  You have several rounds left, and there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to secure the product within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $825,000, it's still above your ideal price. You've shown you're serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if needed. This is a good position to be in.  Continue to negotiate for a better price, as you have several rounds remaining."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $800,000? This would allow you to make a good profit and would fit perfectly within my budget. Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
