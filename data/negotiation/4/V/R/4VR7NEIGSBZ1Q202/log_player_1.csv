Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $750,000, which still provides you with a substantial profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to secure the product within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
