Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and highlighting the product's value to Bob. This can help him feel more motivated to negotiate.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  
* **I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.**
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:**  I'm reducing the price by $35 from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Emphasize value and fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price.""
* **Open-ended question:** The open-ended question invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $140 is a better offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.** 
* **I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, making it the best option.**
* **Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price higher than $150.**"
