Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth while also providing you a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim to sell it for as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  The offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and attractive enough to entice Bob, hopefully preventing you from having to sell to John."
