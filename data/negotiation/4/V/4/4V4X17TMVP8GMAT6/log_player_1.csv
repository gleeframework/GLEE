Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my original asking price, $160 is still above my minimum and it's clear that Bob is willing to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further rounds leading to a lower price or losing the deal altogether."
