Alice's offer is too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit too low for me, considering what I've invested in this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  Let me know if that works for you.

Alice's offer is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $80, but not $82.50. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
