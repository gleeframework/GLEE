Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to him and $100 to me.  I'm confident he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $130 and my previous offer of $140.  I'm hoping this will be agreeable to him, and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $125 is still a profit, I'm not willing to drop my price that low.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $130.  This is a final compromise, as I'm not willing to go lower.  Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him and a decent profit for me.  If he rejects it, I'll have to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $128 is still a profit, I'm not willing to keep negotiating and risk losing time and potentially getting an even lower offer from Bob. I'll accept John's offer of $100 to ensure a sale and move on."
