"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,875.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",11875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I think that's a fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
