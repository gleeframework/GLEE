Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I think it's worth considering. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a good relationship.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob, but I need to be firm about my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating, but I'm starting to consider selling to John if I don't see a significant improvement in Bob's next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,875.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 11875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're already at round 6.  The negotiation isn't moving quickly enough, and I'm worried I'm risking losing the deal with John.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
