"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within my budget.  $900000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $875000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $862500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",862500.0,Bob,4,
