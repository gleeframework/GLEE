"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is not a good fit for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,100,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
