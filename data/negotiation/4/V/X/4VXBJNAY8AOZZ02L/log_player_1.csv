Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12,500 to make this worthwhile. This is a good deal for you as well, given the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I think I can convince him to go a little higher with a counteroffer."
