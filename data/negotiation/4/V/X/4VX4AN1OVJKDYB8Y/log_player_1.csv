Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I believe it's a great deal and you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:** Offering the product at $135 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlighting value:**  While not going into specifics of why the product is worth $120 to Bob, the message implies he's getting a good deal. 
* **Strategic positioning:** By starting at $135, you're aiming for a price that's comfortably above your minimum ($150) while still potentially enticing Bob (whose value is $120). 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
