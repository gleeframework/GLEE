"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There is room for Alice to lower her price, as she values the product at $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $13,500 is the lowest I can go.  It's still a great price for the value this product will bring you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000 and would have to pay that to John.  While there is always the chance to negotiate further, it's a risk.  If Alice rejects another counteroffer, she might not come back with a better deal.  Therefore, accepting the offer at $13,500 is the best choice to maximize savings while still securing the product."
