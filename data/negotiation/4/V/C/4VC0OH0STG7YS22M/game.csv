"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,050,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but my product offers unique features that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000, but I'm not going lower.  This price reflects the true value of my product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that your product has unique features, but I still think $975,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $980,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
