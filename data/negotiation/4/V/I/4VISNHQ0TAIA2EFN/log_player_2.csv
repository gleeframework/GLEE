"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your desired sale price, and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now below Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($1,000,000).** 
* **This is a good deal for Bob, saving him $125,000 compared to buying from John.**  
* **While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer again, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.**

Accepting this offer is the most sensible option to maximize savings."
