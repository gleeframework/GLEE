"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for a product that's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's still a good deal for Bob, but leaves room for negotiation if he's not happy with it. I'm hopeful he'll accept the offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $95. This would be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm aiming for a compromise here. I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm also highlighting the value Bob would be getting. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can do better. How about $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is only $5 less than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the deal and the value Bob will get. Hopefully, this will convince him to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. How about $87? I'm really close to walking away, but I think this product is worth it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87 is still a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's only $2 less than John's offer. There are only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the sale."
