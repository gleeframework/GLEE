"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I believe the product is worth more than $850,000, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering a price of $900,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it still provides you with significant value. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $875,000 is still a bit lower than my ideal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a final price of $887,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this transaction.",887500.0,Alice,5,
