,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $100 for it, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $110, which I think is a fair price considering my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal here!",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $110, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $115. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,5,
