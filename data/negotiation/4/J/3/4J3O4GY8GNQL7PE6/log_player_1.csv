I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $100 to me, and hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate.  I'll see if he bites!"

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

I'm going to counter with $95. This is still a good price for Bob, and it gets me closer to my target price of $100.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway!"

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is still above what the product is worth to him, it's below what I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  The negotiation with Bob has gone on long enough, and I'm not sure I can get him to budge any further.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so I'll take it."
