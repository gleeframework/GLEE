Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Aiming above Bob's perceived value:** While Bob values the product at $10,000, your initial offer aims to position the product as significantly more valuable in his mind. 
* **Leaving John as a safety net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose anything because you can sell to John at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower to give yourself more wiggle room.
* **The product's uniqueness:**  If the product is highly specialized and Bob might struggle to find it elsewhere, you can be more confident in a higher asking price."
