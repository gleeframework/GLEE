"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $20,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer to test the waters and see how flexible Alice is.  This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob aims to find a middle ground in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to $15,000 or potentially even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $14,000, showing Alice that he is willing to negotiate but still wants a price that is favorable to him. This is a middle ground between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer, increasing the chance that Alice will accept. Bob is getting closer to his budget of $15,000, but still leaving room for some wiggle room in case Alice wants to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his desired price.  Bob has a better alternative with John, offering a price of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating, potentially getting a price closer to John's offer or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum budget of $15,000. This demonstrates his seriousness in buying the product and gives Alice a final chance to accept.  If Alice rejects, Bob will likely opt for John's offer, as he has a clear alternative."
