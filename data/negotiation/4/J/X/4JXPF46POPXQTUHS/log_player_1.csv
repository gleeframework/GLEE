"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $150, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm countering with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I hope it will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $165 is getting closer to my minimum value, I still think there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can get closer to $180."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping this will convince Bob to close the deal.  We're getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $160 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not sure we can get much higher with Bob. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. I'll try one more round to see if I can convince him to go up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165. This is the last offer I'm willing to make before selling to John.  Hopefully, this will be enough for Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm disappointed that I didn't get closer to my initial goal, $155 is still a decent profit and more than John's offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
