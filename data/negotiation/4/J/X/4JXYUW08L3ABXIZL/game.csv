"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. Considering its quality and benefits, I would like to offer it to you for $95. This price reflects my desire to make a fair deal while ensuring a reasonable profit for myself.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $100. However, $95 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $80. Would you be willing to come down to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product to you for $87.50, which is between your offer and my initial proposal. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $87.50 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm really serious about buying this product and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. Would you be open to $82.50? That would be a great compromise for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product to you for $85, which is closer to your offer. I hope this price works for you and allows us to reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm very close to my budget limit, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to offer $81. This is my final offer, and I really hope you'll consider it. ",81.0,Bob,6,
