Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob's offer is at my minimum price, but with John ready to buy at the same price, there's no point in further negotiation. I'm guaranteed a sale with John, and I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my counteroffer and leaving me with no sale in the limited rounds."
