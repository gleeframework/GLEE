Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above $1,000,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $1025000. This still leaves a bit of room for both of us.

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,025,000 is a good compromise and ensures I get a better deal than selling to John."
