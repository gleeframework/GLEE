Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 quickly enough to warrant continuing the negotiation.  I can secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and avoid further haggling."
