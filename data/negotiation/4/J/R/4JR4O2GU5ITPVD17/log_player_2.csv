(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You can likely get a better price than $70, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best first step."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $60 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 60}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $68. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $68, which is a good price for you. It's worth accepting her offer to avoid further negotiation and risk losing the product."
