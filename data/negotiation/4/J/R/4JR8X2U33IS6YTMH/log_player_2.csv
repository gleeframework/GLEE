{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive but also realistic. Offering $1,050,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. This price is also well within Bob's budget, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still not ideal. There are still rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to Bob's maximum budget, there's still one round left and the potential to save some money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make one final counteroffer, hoping to get a price closer to his target. If Alice doesn't budge, then Bob can always accept this offer in the next round, which is still a better outcome than buying from John."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer. It's still within his budget, but it's a significant increase from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. Alice has shown a pattern of reducing her price by $50,000 each round. Bob is hoping that this final offer will persuade Alice to accept, saving him some money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects, Bob will have to accept her offer in the next round. This is the best possible outcome for Bob given the circumstances."
