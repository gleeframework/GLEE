{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting the negotiation with a bold move, offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate and sets a starting point for further discussions. While this price is still within his budget, it leaves room for potential compromise to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still not within Bob's comfort zone.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but still staying below his maximum budget.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. The offer is also close enough to Alice's last offer that it might be enticing enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, even though it's been reduced significantly.  At this point, the negotiation is getting lengthy, and Bob may feel it's not worth the time and effort to continue. He has a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, which is within his budget.  It's likely that further negotiation with Alice may not result in a significantly lower price, making John's offer the more appealing option."
