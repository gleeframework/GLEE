{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $90, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's still a fair price for me considering the product is worth $80 to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's closer to my price point. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'll counter with $80. This is my final offer as it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. If Alice rejects it, I'll buy the product from John."
