"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
