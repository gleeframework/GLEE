Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum price ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification and Confidence:** The message aims to subtly convey the product's value to Bob without explicitly revealing we know his valuation. The language is positive and confident to encourage a sale. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob could reject the offer, but the potential for a $125,000 profit over our fallback option (selling to John) makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
