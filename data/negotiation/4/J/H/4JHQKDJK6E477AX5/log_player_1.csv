Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm happy to start the negotiations at $18,000. What are your thoughts on this price?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth a significant amount, you anchor the value in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""happy to start the negotiations"" signals to Bob that you are willing to be flexible.
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects this initial high offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a fair opportunity to purchase the product."
