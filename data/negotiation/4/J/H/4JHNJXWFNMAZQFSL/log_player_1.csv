Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000 for the product, which is a good price for both of us. It's a significant jump from my previous offer, and it's still well within my budget.  Let's close this deal and finalize the sale.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,075,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's substantially higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and John's offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations longer risks Bob walking away or me missing other opportunities. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, potentially benefiting future dealings."
