"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I have to consider the value the product holds for you. It's a significant investment, and I think you'll appreciate its worth at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product holds value, but I also have a budget to stick to. My final offer is $1,000,000. It's a strong offer, and I think it's more than fair.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
