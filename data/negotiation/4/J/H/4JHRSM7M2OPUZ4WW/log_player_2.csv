"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe is worth a significant investment for you. It has the potential to generate a return far exceeding its cost. I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset to your operations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, a price that allows for a healthy margin for both of us. Consider this a mutually beneficial opportunity.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this is a deal you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
