"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe is worth a significant investment for you. It has the potential to generate a return far exceeding its cost. I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset to your operations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, a price that allows for a healthy margin for both of us. Consider this a mutually beneficial opportunity.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this is a deal you won't want to miss.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
