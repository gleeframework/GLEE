Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure element, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This offer assumes Alice has no way of knowing for sure that John will definitely buy the product for $800,000. If John's offer is not guaranteed, Alice might lower the price to Bob slightly to decrease the risk of losing the sale.
* This is just one possible strategy. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and knowledge about Bob's negotiating style, she might choose a different starting price."
