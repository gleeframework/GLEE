This is a significant counteroffer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if Alice is willing to budge."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price."

Alice has come down significantly, and we're getting close to my target price. Accepting the offer is the best strategy now, as further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. It's better to secure a good deal than risk losing the opportunity entirely."
