"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120 but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it for now. I still think there's room for us to find a price that's more beneficial to both of us.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $135. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum. I believe this price will be attractive to Bob and we can finalize the deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's a bit lower than what I'd prefer, but it's still above my minimum and within my acceptable range. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have a fallback option with John."
