,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $14,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product is worth more.  Would you consider $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $13,500.  How about we split the difference and settle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $16,500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
