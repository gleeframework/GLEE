"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value and can adjust my offers accordingly."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to come closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price to $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession, but I believe it's still a fair price considering Bob's interest. I'm hopeful he'll see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to sell the product to him at this price. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
