"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum value and still leaves you with a profit margin. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,
