{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message, builds a bit of rapport, and sets a price point that is a bit above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get a price closer to Bob's value, but it's important to remember I can always fall back on John's offer of $100 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $125 is above my minimum of $100 and closer to my desired price. Accepting his offer is the best strategy in this case."
