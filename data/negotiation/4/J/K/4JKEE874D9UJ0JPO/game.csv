"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This still reflects the value of the product, but I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from the original price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and find a compromise.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1700000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and propose $1800000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
