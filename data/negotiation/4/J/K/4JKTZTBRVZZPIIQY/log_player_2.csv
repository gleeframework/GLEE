It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $10,000 is a good starting point for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to a price that's reasonable and within my budget.  There's no guarantee I can get a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the product altogether.  $10,500 is a good deal."
