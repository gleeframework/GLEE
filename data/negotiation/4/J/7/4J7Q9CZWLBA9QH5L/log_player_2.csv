"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she's already making a profit by selling it for $95. 
* You have a better option with John, who is willing to sell for $100, so you should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* This counteroffer gives Alice a $5 profit, which is still better than her value of $80. 
* I am hopeful that Alice will be willing to accept this offer, given that she's already making a profit.  However, I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my desired price point. I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to $85, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.
* John's offer of $100 is still a backup option if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I still believe there's room for compromise. 
* I'm offering $87, which is a fair middle ground between my previous offer of $85 and her current offer of $90.
* This offer gives Alice a $7 profit, which is still a good margin for her. I'm hoping that she'll be willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
