"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  By rejecting, you can propose a lower price and potentially save more money. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** While John's price is higher, it's a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. This product is worth a lot to you, so I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point. 
* **Negotiation space remains.** You're still willing to pay more than Alice's minimum value, so further negotiation is possible.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You're not desperate to buy from Alice, so John's offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price given your value and my budget. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is now offering $10,750. This is a good deal for you.
* **Risk of further negotiation.**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might become less flexible.
* **Time is ticking.** You're already 5 rounds in.  Staying too stubborn might lead to a worse outcome, especially since buying from John is always an option.

**Overall:**  Accepting this offer minimizes your risk and gets you the product at a good price."
