"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I also want to highlight the value to Bob, hoping that he'll see it as a good deal despite the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's still above my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. This product is worth a lot to you, so I hope you'll consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $11,000, which is still a good profit for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price given your value and my budget. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm offering $10,750, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us."
