Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $825,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $825,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  It's a significant profit over my minimum ($800,000) and John's standing offer.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations can be unpredictable.  Dragging this out longer might not yield a better result, and I risk Bob walking away.  
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to make a deal, potentially leading to future business."
