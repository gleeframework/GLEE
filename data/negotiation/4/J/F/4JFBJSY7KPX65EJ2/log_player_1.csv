Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $11,000 is a fair price for the product. Can we agree on that?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $15,500, so I'm thinking $12,750 is a fair price for the product. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from Bob. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
