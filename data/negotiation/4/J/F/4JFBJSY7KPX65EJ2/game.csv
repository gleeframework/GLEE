"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. Given its unique value, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $11,000 is a fair price for the product. Can we agree on that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $11,000 is cutting a bit too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $15,500? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $15,500, so I'm thinking $12,750 is a fair price for the product. Can we agree on that?",12750.0,Bob,6,
