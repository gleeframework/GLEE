"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the potential benefits this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it will be a win-win for both of us. ",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $925,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget constraints. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,5,
