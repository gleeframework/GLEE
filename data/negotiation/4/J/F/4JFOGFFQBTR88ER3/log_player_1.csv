While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  It's significantly more than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now is generally better than risking further negotiation and potentially getting a similar or even lower offer from Bob later. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's always a chance Bob could walk away in future rounds, leaving me to accept John's lower offer."
