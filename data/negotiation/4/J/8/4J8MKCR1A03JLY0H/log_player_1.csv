Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), I start the negotiation significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring that even if Bob negotiates me down, I'm still making a substantial profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" aiming to justify the high asking price.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" aims to make the offer seem more desirable and time-sensitive, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Safety Net:** I'm comfortable offering a high price because I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum acceptable price. This reduces my risk and empowers me to be bolder in my negotiation with Bob."
