Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While Bob has come up in price, we're still a bit apart, and I don't want to risk him continuing to lowball me. I'd rather secure the sale with John and get my desired price."
