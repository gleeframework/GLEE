"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $15,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above his budget. He can buy the same product from John for $8,000 and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really only able to offer $9,000 for the product.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's above my budget and below what you're hoping to get."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget. He's better off rejecting her offer and sending another counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation, and he can always buy from John if he can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm really only able to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, as it's still above my budget and closer to what you're hoping to get.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500, which is $10,250. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price. There are still rounds available, and he can always buy from John if he can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,250 is still too high for me.  I'm only able to offer $9,750. This is a fair compromise and gives us both a decent outcome.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's only got one round left, and Alice's price is still above his budget.  He's already gotten a better price from John, so it's the safest option to avoid any further negotiation risk."
