"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $900,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $1,050,000. This is my final offer in this range. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have a bottom line.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm afraid $950,000 is as high as I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000, which is the same price I offered in round 3. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I can do $975,000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,9,
