Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $1,050,000. This is my final offer in this range. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000, which is the same price I offered in round 3. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?

We're getting close to the point where further negotiation with Alice might not yield significant savings.  It's time to start pushing a bit harder to see if she's truly willing to come down."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I can do $975,000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly signaling this is her best offer.  While we could try to push her a little further in the last round, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her walking away. Accepting the $1,025,000 offer secures a reasonable deal."
