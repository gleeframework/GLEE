Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a profit above your minimum. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
