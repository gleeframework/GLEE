"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $145 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $148. This is a very fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a reasonable cost. Let's make this deal happen!",148.0,Alice,5,
