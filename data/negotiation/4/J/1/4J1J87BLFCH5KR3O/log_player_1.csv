``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This price is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but also leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value I'm aiming for. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counter-offering at $110. This price is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin."
