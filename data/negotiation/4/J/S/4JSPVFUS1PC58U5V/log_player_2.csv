"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm very passionate about, and I know it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for your needs.  I'm offering it to you for $12500. This is a price that allows me to make a fair profit, while still giving you a significant advantage over acquiring it elsewhere.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further with Alice or potentially find another seller with a lower price."
