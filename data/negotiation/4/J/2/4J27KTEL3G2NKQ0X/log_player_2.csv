"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within a reasonable range considering your maximum budget of $800,000. It shows Alice you're serious about buying the product, but you're also prepared to walk away if she doesn't come down to a more acceptable price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. Although it's lower than her initial offer, it's still not an acceptable price. Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you another chance to negotiate a better price. If Alice doesn't come down further, you can always choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your maximum budget of $800,000 and Alice's offer of $1,050,000. It shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product but are not willing to go above your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,075,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. While you could continue to counter-offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to a price you're willing to pay.  Since John is offering the product for your maximum budget, it's more prudent to go ahead and buy from him."
