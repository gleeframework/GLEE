"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  $800,000 is a significant discount, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **I want to see if I can get a better deal.** By rejecting, I can try to push Alice lower.
* **John's offer is my safety net.** If the negotiation with Alice goes sour, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the generous offer, Alice!  I'm very interested in this product, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, showing I'm serious about getting a lower price. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  While $700,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to go higher if necessary.  
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable, increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still confident that the product's value lies in its unique features. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $750,000 is a fair price for the product.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation is moving along, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.
* **John's offer is still a backup:** I can still purchase from John if this deal falls through. 

**While I could potentially push for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal with Alice is too high at this point.**"
