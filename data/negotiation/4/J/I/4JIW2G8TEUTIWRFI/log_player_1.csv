Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  The ideal scenario is to sell it for a price between $800,001 and $999,999.

**The Offer**

You need to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts.  Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm valuing it at $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment for your specific needs."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Value Justification:**  Instead of focusing solely on price, highlight the product's value and how it benefits Bob specifically. This can make the price more palatable. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies that if Bob doesn't take it, someone else will.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower to give more negotiation room.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** Are you willing to risk Bob rejecting the offer and settle for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John?  A higher price has a higher potential reward but also a higher risk of rejection."
