Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a million, it's unlikely he'll reach it quickly enough within the remaining rounds to be worth the risk. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which meets my minimum requirement. It's time to take the guaranteed profit and move on."
