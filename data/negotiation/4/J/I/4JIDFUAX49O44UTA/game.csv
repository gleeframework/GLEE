"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
