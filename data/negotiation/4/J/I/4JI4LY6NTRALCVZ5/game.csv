"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  This is my final offer,  let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look at other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
