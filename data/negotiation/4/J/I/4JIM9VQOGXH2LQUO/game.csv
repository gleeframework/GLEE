"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. It's a fair price that gives you a decent margin and gets me closer to my budget. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
