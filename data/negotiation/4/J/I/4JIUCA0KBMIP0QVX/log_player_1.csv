Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it's worth the higher price without explicitly stating Bob would be overpaying.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests you're open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own stated value for the product. Accepting this would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is an option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:**  You acknowledge Bob's counter-offer to show you're engaged, but stand firm that $8,000 is too low.
* **Reiterating Value:**  You reinforce the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting $11,500, you signal willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. This price point allows for further back-and-forth while keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While the product is good, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slowly inching upward, but it's clear he's aiming for a price well below your minimum acceptable price.  Furthermore, his increments are getting smaller, suggesting he's reaching his limit.  

At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob has a low probability of reaching a price you find acceptable. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees you a profit and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiation tactics dragging the price down further."
