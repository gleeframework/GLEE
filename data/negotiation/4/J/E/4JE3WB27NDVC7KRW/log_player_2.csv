"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. It's a risk, but the potential reward of a lower price outweighs the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's offering $850,000, which is still a good deal for Alice (above her desired selling price of $800,000) but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to her initial offer than Bob's last counteroffer, but it's still higher than what Bob would like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, especially considering the potential of buying from John. It's a risk, but rejecting Alice's offer keeps the possibility of a lower price open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise, but still keeping the price lower than Alice's latest offer.  This move keeps the negotiation moving while attempting to secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to her initial price, and the negotiation seems to be stalling.  There's a high risk that continued negotiation will lead to Alice refusing further counteroffers, leaving Bob with no other choice but to buy from John at a higher price. At this point, it's more strategic to accept the known cost from John rather than risk a worse outcome with Alice."
