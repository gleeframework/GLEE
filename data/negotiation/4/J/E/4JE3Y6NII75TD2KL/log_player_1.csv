Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  Given the product's value to you, I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, I'm still holding out for a higher price. We're early in the negotiation and I believe I have leverage to secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,262,500.  This offer reflects my desire to close the deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1262500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm continuing to make gradual concessions, signaling my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer.  This approach maintains a firm stance while encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,262,500 is still a bit above my ideal price point.  I'm feeling confident in our negotiation and believe we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,193,750.  This is my best possible offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both sides. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,193,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,193,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting at $1,193,750 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing further.  It's a strong return, even if it's not the absolute highest I could have achieved."
