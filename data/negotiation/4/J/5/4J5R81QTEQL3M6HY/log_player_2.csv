"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to let it go for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. There's a chance she might accept, and even if she doesn't, it sets a lower anchor for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is my final offer. If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down a bit, but $110 is still more than I'm aiming for. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $90 is a big jump, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm proposing a price that is the maximum I'm willing to pay and is also a round number.  This could appeal to Alice's desire to close the deal quickly."
