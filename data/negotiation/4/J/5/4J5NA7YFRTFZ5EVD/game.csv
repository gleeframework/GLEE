"Alice,  $1,200,000 is way out of my range. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is simply too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product at $1,000,000. This is my final price point, but I'm confident it's still a great value for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. How about $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
