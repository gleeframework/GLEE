"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still within a range where a negotiation feels possible. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is upbeat and emphasizes the value Bob will gain.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  I have John's offer as a safety net, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is way out of my range. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob's message indicates he's still interested and open to negotiation.  
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I'm going to try and squeeze out a better deal with Bob.  I have 9 rounds left to explore."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is simply too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product at $1,000,000. This is my final price point, but I'm confident it's still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum price point, but presenting it as a compromise and a ""final"" offer. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him that he's getting a good deal.
* **Avoid Excessively Aggressive Bargaining:**  I want to keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid pushing Bob away with a too-high price.  John's offer provides security if Bob walks away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. How about $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, I run the risk of Bob walking away completely. He's clearly pushing the limits of his budget.
* **Time is Limited:**  I have only 6 rounds left to close a deal, and I want to secure a sale. John's offer is a good backup, but it's not ideal.

While $900,000 isn't my dream price, it's a good deal considering the negotiation and my time constraints."
