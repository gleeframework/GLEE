"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time exception to offer it to you at a special price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
