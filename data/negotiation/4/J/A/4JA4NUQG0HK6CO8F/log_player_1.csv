Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $110, I give Bob some room to bargain while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going. It signals to Bob that I'm willing to compromise but not at his initial price.
* **Exploring Counteroffers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him, or see if he's willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:**  $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I get a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $95 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, it's still below that. 
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiations can take time and energy, and John is already offering my minimum price. 
* **Certainty over Risk:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum profit, while continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might reject my next counteroffer or walk away entirely."
