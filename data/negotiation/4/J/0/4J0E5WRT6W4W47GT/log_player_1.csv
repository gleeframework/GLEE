Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob as it's $2,000 less than what it's worth to him.
* **Lower than my minimum:** It's significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000, giving me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Opening the negotiation:**  It establishes a starting point and gives Bob the impression that I am willing to negotiate.

This approach maximizes my chances of getting a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you be willing to come down to $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is more than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer represents a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above minimum:**  $11,250 is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't sell below my desired price.
* **Staying within Bob's range:** This counteroffer keeps the price within Bob's initial range, suggesting a potential agreement.

By continuing to negotiate, I'm aiming to maximize my profit without risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still a bit higher than my initial offer.  Let's meet halfway again - I'm willing to pay $10750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could continue negotiating, the chances of him going higher seem slim.  

To avoid further time wasted in negotiations, it's best to take the guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. This ensures I maximize my profit and avoid any further risk of a lower price."
