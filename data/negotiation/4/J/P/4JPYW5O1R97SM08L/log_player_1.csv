"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value. This allows for some negotiation room and shows that I'm confident in the product's worth. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While I'm aiming for a good price, I'm also aware of John's offer, which I can use as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter-Offer:**  Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good sign that he's engaged and willing to negotiate.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $15,000 would be a guaranteed win, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a better price from Bob.

**Next Round:** I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'll be cautious but optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that even at $13,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away too much. I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my target."
