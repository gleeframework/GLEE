Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level.  I'm confident in selling to John for $10,000, so I have room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get closer to $10,000 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value.  It's a smaller step than my initial offer, indicating a genuine desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, $9,250 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over his first offer, and further negotiation might not yield a much better price.  Considering John's offer as a safety net, I'm willing to take the deal."
