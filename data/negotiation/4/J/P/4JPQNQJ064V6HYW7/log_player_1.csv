Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $100, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially settle on a price that's beneficial for both of you.
* **It's not too aggressive:** By starting at $95, you avoid immediately alienating Bob with a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum price, it doesn't leave any room for profit. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $85? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** It's a compromise that demonstrates you're willing to negotiate.
* **Is still within your profit margin:** $85 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're still making a profit.
* **Is a reasonable amount:** It's only $5 more than Bob's offer, making it a relatively small step."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $82.50 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum selling price to John, and it's only $2.50 lower than your last offer. Accepting this offer allows you to make a small profit while securing the sale."
