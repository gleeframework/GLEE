Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.  It also acknowledges the value of the product to Bob, potentially making him more likely to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent profit, I can likely do better.  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while securing a price closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is still a significant profit for me and significantly higher than John's offer.  At this point, further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
