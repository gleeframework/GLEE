"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice is offering the product for the same price, accepting her offer is the best option. It allows Bob to acquire the product without exceeding his budget.  Rejecting the offer would lead him to buy from John for the same price, so there's no advantage in doing that."
