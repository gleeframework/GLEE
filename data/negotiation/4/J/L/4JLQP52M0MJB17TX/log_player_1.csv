"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  It's worth more than that to me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that $1200000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can come to terms. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
Bob's offer is exactly what John is willing to pay.  There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as I can sell the product to John for the same price right now."
