Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

While I could hold out for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,170,000 is a good business decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** Even at this price, I'm making a substantial profit above my minimum ($1,500,000 value).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly committed to the purchase and has made steady concessions. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other investments or opportunities. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a risk Bob could walk away if I push too hard, leaving me to start over with another buyer."
