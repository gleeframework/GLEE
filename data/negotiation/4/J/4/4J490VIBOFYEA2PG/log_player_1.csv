Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Knowing its value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""uniqueness"" to justify the high price, even though it's significantly marked up.
* **Backup plan:** The safety net of John's offer at $1,000,000 provides leverage. If Bob rejects the offer, we still secure the minimum desired amount.

**Important Note:** This strategy is risky. Bob might be completely turned off by the high price and refuse to negotiate. However, the potential reward of a much higher sale price makes it a gamble worth considering in this scenario."
