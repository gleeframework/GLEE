Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000.  While it's worth significantly more to me, I'm confident this price reflects its potential value for your needs.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than John's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. 
* **Message:** This message is designed to be polite but firm. It emphasizes the product's potential value for Bob, while also reminding him that you have a backup buyer willing to pay a significant amount.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Likely Response:** You have no information on Bob's budget or the product's value to him.  There's a chance he'll find the price too high and reject the offer.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob expresses interest but thinks the price is too high.  You may be able to lower the price slightly, but be cautious about going too low, as you want to maximize your profit."
