"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity that could greatly benefit your business. I believe its value far exceeds the $8000 you mentioned, but let's start with a fair negotiation. My initial offer is $12000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To try to find common ground, I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. This still allows us to achieve a reasonable profit while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum of $8,000. There's still room for negotiation to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider $9500 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value I receive from the sale and the value you perceive in the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  While there's potential for further negotiation, you've already spent a few rounds trying to get a lower price. At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $8,000.  You'll save $1,500 compared to Alice's latest offer."
