Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product for slightly less than its value to you ($1,200,000) but significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) aims to find a middle ground where you both benefit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,150,000, there might be a little wiggle room for negotiation if Bob counters. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your profit while still offering Bob a price that could be enticing if he's particularly interested in the product."
