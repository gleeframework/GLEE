Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's keep talking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round.  While $1,000,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  It's a fair price considering the value this product offers you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer to what I want, I still believe I can get a better price if I keep negotiating.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a sweet spot here.  How about we compromise once more and settle on $1,075,000?  This price allows me to move forward and keeps things fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Although $1,025,000 is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $800,000. It's time to close this deal and secure a decent profit."
