You have three options:

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get a good deal, and you might even be able to get it for $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a good price for both of us. Let's make a deal!

While $11,000 is closer to your target, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get Alice to come down to $10,500."
