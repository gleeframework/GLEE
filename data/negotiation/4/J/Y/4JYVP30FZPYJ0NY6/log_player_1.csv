Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** A high starting price can help gauge Bob's interest level. If he's willing to negotiate down from $120, it shows he's serious. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost much and can adjust accordingly. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the safety net of selling to John for $80, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below both your minimum price ($80) and his own valuation of the product ($80).  There's significant room for negotiation. By rejecting this lowball offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but not too much):**  You're showing willingness to negotiate by moving significantly down from your initial offer. However, you're still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $100, you're positioning it as a fair compromise, even though it's still closer to your initial asking price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You want to avoid appearing desperate to sell, so don't drop your price too drastically too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Sale:** $90 is above your minimum acceptable price and provides you with a $10 profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is small, and there's a risk Bob might walk away entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth, saving you time and effort."
