"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $15000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $15000?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I respect the value you place on the product, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. My counteroffer would be $14000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",14000.0,Bob,4,
