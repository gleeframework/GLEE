Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's a bit too high for my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, but we haven't been able to agree on a price that works for both of us.  While I'm close to my desired price, I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement.  To ensure I don't lose out on a sale, I'll take John's offer of $8,000.  It's my minimum price, and I'm happy with that outcome."
