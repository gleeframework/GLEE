"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we try $87? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",87.0,Alice,3,
