"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we try $87? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.
