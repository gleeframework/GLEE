"Alice, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget for it is $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I understand your budget, however,  the product's value is significantly higher than that.  Could you consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
