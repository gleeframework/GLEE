"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm selling it for $120, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is overpriced. You can try to get a better price by rejecting it and seeing if she'll come down. You can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
