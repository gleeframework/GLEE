I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum. This allows for negotiation and gives me some room to come down a bit."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,250?  That's still a good deal for you, and gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
