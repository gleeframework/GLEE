Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 is slightly below my minimum but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" for Bob while maximizing my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The slightly inflated price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a price closer to my $150 minimum."
