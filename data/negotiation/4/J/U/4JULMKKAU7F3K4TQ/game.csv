"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $8,800. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle somewhere around $7,900?",7900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you a price of $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with the negotiation.  $8,200 is getting closer. How about we try $8,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",8000.0,Bob,6,
