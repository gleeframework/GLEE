"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is significantly higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000.  I believe that's a fair price considering your value for the product and the market conditions.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable figure.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This would still leave you with a significant profit margin, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm prepared to pay $875000, which is a fair compromise considering both our positions.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point. I'm willing to drop my price to $885000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",885000.0,Alice,5,
