,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's also a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,312,500. Can you consider this offer?",1312500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're still working within your budget, but $1,312,500 is still a little lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference once more and go with $1,320,000? This price is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",1320000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,315,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",1315000.0,Bob,8,
