"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $1,400,000? I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the value.  While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you partway.  How about we consider $1,700,000? I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
