What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $1,400,000? I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering our positions, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our respective values. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,600,000 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing him as a buyer."
