"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a significant profit for me, and it's well below what the product is worth to Bob.  I'm confident we can reach a deal within the 10 rounds, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum threshold of $100, and it's likely we won't get a better offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
