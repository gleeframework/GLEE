Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  If he rejects, I'll see where he stands and adjust accordingly.  If I need to, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $8,000, as that is significantly below my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a substantial reduction from my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum value and not worth it to me.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $13,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. If he rejects this offer, I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, even though I've made several concessions. I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but he's not willing to meet my minimum price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
