Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is closer to my minimum than his, and I think I can get a better price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more,  $920,000 is still a good deal for me, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
