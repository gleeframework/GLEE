Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay slightly less. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,999 is a very attractive price point psychologically. It's just below the $15,000 mark, making it seem like a significant saving for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the message implies a degree of firmness, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly set on a lower price. I can then assess if it's worth accepting a slightly lower amount than going with John."
