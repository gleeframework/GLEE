"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $850,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe $875,000 is still quite high given my budget constraints. I would like to propose $860,000 as a counteroffer. This price reflects a compromise between the value of the product and my financial capacity.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $860,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $865,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",865000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I am still unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose $862,500 as a counteroffer. This amount aims to bridge our positions while staying within my budget constraints.",862500.0,Bob,6,
