Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,200,000. This seems like a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
