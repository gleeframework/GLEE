{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $120 allows for some negotiation room while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Counter:** If Bob finds the price too high, he might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially still get a price higher than $150.
* **Securing a Profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $120 ensures you make a profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** You have John as a backup buyer at $150, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum."
