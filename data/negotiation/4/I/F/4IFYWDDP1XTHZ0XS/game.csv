"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the best I can do at this point.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $108 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we compromise at $112? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with the product. Let me know what you think!",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $109? That's the absolute limit for me.,109.0,Bob,6,
