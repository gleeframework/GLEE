"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150.
* Alice's offer is $120, which is better than John's price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer is $110.
* This is still a good price for you, as it is lower than your maximum price of $150 and John's price of $150. 
* There is a chance you could negotiate further, but it's likely that Alice will not go lower. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
