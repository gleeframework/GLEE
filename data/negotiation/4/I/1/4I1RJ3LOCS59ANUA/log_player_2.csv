"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and my own investment in it. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,125? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to move forward.
