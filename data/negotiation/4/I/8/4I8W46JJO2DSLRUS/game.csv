"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $900,000.

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.
