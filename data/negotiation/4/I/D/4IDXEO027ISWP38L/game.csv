"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too steep for me right now.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  $80 is definitely too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get great value from this product.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to move up to $95, but that's really the highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm able to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $112? This allows for some wiggle room for both of us and is a fair price given the value of the product. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying hard to make this work, but $112 is still pushing it for me.  How about we settle at $100 even?  That's a solid offer, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you agree.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up a bit. $100 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's split the difference and settle on $106. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly at this price. What do you say?",106.0,Alice,7,
