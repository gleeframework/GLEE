Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  $80 is definitely too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get great value from this product.  What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm able to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $112? This allows for some wiggle room for both of us and is a fair price given the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying hard to make this work, but $112 is still pushing it for me.  How about we settle at $100 even?  That's a solid offer, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you agree."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up a bit. $100 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's split the difference and settle on $106. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly at this price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $106, and you have a guaranteed option at $100 with John.  Don't risk overpaying by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
