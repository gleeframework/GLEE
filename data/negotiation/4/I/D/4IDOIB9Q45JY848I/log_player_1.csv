Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,200,000, Alice wants to see if she can get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,150,000) leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party (John) creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While this offer is a good starting point for Alice, it's essential to remember that Bob only values the product at $1,000,000. He might try to negotiate a lower price.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  Alice's success will depend on her negotiation skills and her ability to highlight the value of the product to Bob, potentially justifying the higher price."
