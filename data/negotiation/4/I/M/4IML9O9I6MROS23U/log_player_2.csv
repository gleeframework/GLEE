"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go to $11,500?  That's a fair compromise and would allow me to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's still above my minimum value.  Let's try to make this work, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get Alice to agree to a price closer to my target.  If she doesn't budge, I'll buy from John to ensure I get the product at a price within my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really close to my budget, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you consider $11,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $11,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,800 as a final compromise.  This is just above my minimum and allows us to both get a good deal.  Let's close this out, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,800 is still outside of my budget, and I've already made several counteroffers. It's unlikely I'll be able to get her down to my desired price within the remaining rounds.  To avoid the risk of going over budget or getting stuck in a stalemate, I'll go ahead and buy the product from John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed purchase at a price that fits my budget."
