"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, showing flexibility.

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll use John as a backup option if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too far off.  

**Strategy:** 

I will counter with a price closer to my minimum while keeping John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting halfway between my minimum value and Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $13,500, he's getting a good deal.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a clear justification for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value proposition for both parties.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal as quickly as possible while still maximizing my profit. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for further negotiation. I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go to $11,500?  That's a fair compromise and would allow me to make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to maintain a balance between getting a decent price and avoiding a drawn-out negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to close the deal within the next few rounds. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's still above my minimum value.  Let's try to make this work, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm showing further flexibility by lowering my price again, demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal.
* **Emphasize Fair Price:** I'm reminding Bob that I'm still trying to get a fair price for my product,  which helps to justify my counteroffer.
* **Time Pressure:**  The phrase ""Let's try to make this work"" adds a subtle sense of time pressure, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's both profitable for me and acceptable to Bob. I'm moving closer to his offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.  I'm also prepared to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really close to my budget, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you consider $11,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum value. While he's getting close, I need to hold out for a slightly higher price. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware of John's offer as a backup.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price just above his offer, aiming to secure a deal within the next few rounds. I'm trying to balance maximizing my profit with the risk of losing the deal to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $11,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,800 as a final compromise.  This is just above my minimum and allows us to both get a good deal.  Let's close this out, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** I'm emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both of us.
* **Closing Statement:** ""Let's close this out"" encourages Bob to make a decision and avoid further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to close the deal as quickly as possible while still getting as close to my minimum value as I can. This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a compromise before considering John's offer."
