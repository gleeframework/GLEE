"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if I can push Bob closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1080000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1060000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's aim for a quick agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is getting closer to my desired range, I'm still not satisfied with the profit.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round. I have 6 rounds left and want to maximize my earnings."
