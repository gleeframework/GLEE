"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer, $1050000 is still a bit below my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1080000.  This allows for a compromise and hopefully gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1080000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1060000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's aim for a quick agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1060000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1070000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen!",1070000.0,Alice,5,
