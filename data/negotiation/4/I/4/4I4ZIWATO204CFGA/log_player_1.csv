Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the deal for both parties. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a better price than John's offer:**  By starting at $1,000,000, there's potential to negotiate a higher price than John's $1,200,000.
* **Encourage Bob to counteroffer:**  A counteroffer from Bob will allow you to gauge his seriousness and adjust your strategy accordingly.
* **Maintain flexibility:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always choose to accept John's offer or counteroffer with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm confident in the product's value. This will encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and fairness:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to compromise, but also points out that $950,000 is a fair price.
* **Positive outcome:**  Highlighting that both parties can be happy with the deal helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Strategic price:** $950,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still below my minimum value, allowing room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Push Bob closer to my desired price:**  The counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's initial proposal, putting pressure on him to increase his offer.
* **Maintain a cooperative approach:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution, fostering a positive environment for further negotiation.
* **Avoid hasty decisions:**  By not accepting his offer, I show that I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better price, maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I'm trying to stay within my budget and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While my goal was to get a price closer to $1,000,000,  Bob's counteroffer of $920,000 is very close to my minimum value of $900,000.  At this point, it's  a good deal for me.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and potential stalemates. 
* **Time efficiency:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on, especially if Bob continues to make small counteroffers.
* **Reasonable compromise:** $920,000 is a solid price that ensures I make a good profit while also securing a sale."
