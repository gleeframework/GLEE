"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you and higher than my minimum acceptable price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $950,000? That would still be a significant savings for you compared to its value to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, and it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
