Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $7,500, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I still have 8 rounds left and can make a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $7,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm feeling optimistic that I can get a better deal with Bob, and I still have 6 rounds left."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8250}

While $7,750 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal with Bob, and I still have 4 rounds left. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer."

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob.  He's stuck at $7,500, and with only two rounds left, I'm unlikely to get him to budge.  It's better to sell to John for $8,000 and guarantee the minimum price I'm willing to accept."
