"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me. It also opens the conversation and establishes a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy the product from you, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000, it's important to keep negotiating. I'm confident that I can get a higher price by rejecting his offer and continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a stretch for my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe we can still negotiate a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This price allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
