,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy the product from you, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a stretch for my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This price allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
