Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm willing to extend this price as a courtesy to give you first right of refusal."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows me to potentially earn a bit more. 
* **High but Justifiable:** $14,999 is a strong price, but the message frames it as a ""first right of refusal"" offer, implying Bob gets a special advantage before a guaranteed sale elsewhere.
* **Psychology:**  The price just below $15,000 might make it seem more appealing than a round $15,000.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate further. I need to be prepared to hold firm near my $15,000 baseline or politely decline and proceed with John."
