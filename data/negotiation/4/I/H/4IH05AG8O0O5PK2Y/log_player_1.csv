Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay what I consider to be a fair price for the product.  I've already offered him a few compromises, but he's holding firm at $10,000.  At this point, I'm better off selling to John for the same price.  I'm not willing to risk going another round and ending up with nothing."
