"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. I've carefully considered its value, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. To kick off our negotiations, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the immense value this product holds.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. While $1,200,000 is a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues the unique benefits and potential this product offers. To move us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's unique benefits, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
