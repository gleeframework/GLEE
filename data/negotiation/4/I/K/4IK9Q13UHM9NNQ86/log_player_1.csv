{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can strike a mutually beneficial deal.  My starting price is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of a price of $900000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be. This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my desired price and is a significant improvement over his previous offer. Accepting this offer would secure a sale well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and it's a fair compromise."
