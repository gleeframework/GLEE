"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is key.** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and starting negotiations is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer represents a considerable investment from my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target. 
* **Negotiation continues.** Bob can still likely secure a better deal if he continues to negotiate.  
* **John's price is a backup.** Bob has a fallback option with John, so he can afford to be patient and hold out for a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. I'm eager to close this transaction and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
