"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to set a strong baseline and see how much Bob is willing to pay.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better understanding of his price range and can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,900,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident in the value of my product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him while still keeping the deal profitable for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price. This counteroffer is a good compromise that should encourage Bob to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,725,000 is a significant amount, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I have a few more rounds to close the deal with Bob, so I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 7

{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer and brings the price closer to Bob's most recent offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal and that we're getting closer to an agreement."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,700,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have two rounds left with Bob and I'm confident that I can secure a better price."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer and is only $50,000 more than Bob's last offer. With just one round left, I need to make a decision that will secure a sale. I believe this price is a good compromise that will hopefully encourage Bob to accept."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, as Bob's offer is just below my minimum. However, I've already rejected his last offer, and if I reject this one, I risk losing the deal entirely. With only one round left, I'm not confident I can push Bob any higher.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good amount and guarantees a sale."
