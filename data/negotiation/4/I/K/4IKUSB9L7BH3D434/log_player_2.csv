"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I'd hate to part with it for less than its worth to me ($80), I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is more than the product's worth to her ($80), it's still significantly less than your maximum budget of $150 and the price John offers ($150). Accepting this offer saves you money."
