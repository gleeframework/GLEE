Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Chance:** You only get one shot with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose him.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob (meaning it's less than $1,200,000) but maximizes your profit. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and to make this a win-win, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing adds a touch of urgency and importance.
* **Win-Win:**  Highlighting a ""win-win"" emphasizes that you're looking out for both of your interests.
* **Price Justification (Implied):**  You're not stating why the price is this high, leaving room for Bob to assume it's based on its high value.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and prevents him from shopping around too much.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price.

**Remember:**  This is just one offer strategy. The best approach depends on your assessment of Bob and your negotiation style."
