"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, giving you time to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's always a chance you can secure a better price through counteroffers."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer.

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While closer to your budget, $875,000 is still outside your maximum limit of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left, which means there's still time to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By continuing to counteroffer, you may be able to get closer to your target price or even get Alice to agree on a price closer to your budget."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $870,000 is closer to your budget, it's still outside your maximum limit of $800,000. 
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  By accepting, you're only saving $30,000 compared to buying from John. You still have 5 rounds to negotiate with Alice, which might lead to a better deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $880,000. This is the maximum price I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unwilling to budge:**  Alice has rejected multiple counteroffers and is now offering a price that is still $80,000 above your maximum budget. 
* **Limited negotiation time:** You only have 3 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed deal with John:**  By buying from John, you secure the product at your maximum budget and avoid the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice. 

It's important to weigh the potential for a better deal with Alice against the certainty of a deal with John, and the remaining time you have to negotiate. In this case, the guaranteed deal with John is the safer and more practical choice."
