"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's a good starting point for us to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $937,500. This gives us both a good deal, and we can finally close this transaction. What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,
