"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $100 is still too high for him, as he values the product at $150.  Rejecting the offer allows him to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $100 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a significant discount, aiming for a price closer to his own valuation.  He's offering a price that's a bit more than what Alice values the product at, but still lower than what he's willing to pay. This shows he's serious about buying but wants a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He values the product at $150, and $90 is still more than half of that. Rejecting allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit out of my range. How about $85?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from $75, showing flexibility.  $85 is still below his maximum price of $150 and above Alice's valuation of $80, potentially making it a good compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $87.50? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his target price of $80.  $87.50 is within his budget and represents a good deal considering he's willing to pay $150 from John.  Accepting the offer means getting the product for a lower price while still having room for profit if he decides to resell it.  He's also saving time and effort compared to further negotiation."
