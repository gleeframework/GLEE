Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly tone to build rapport. 
* **Value proposition:** Briefly mentioning the product's value to pique Bob's interest. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my own assessment of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount. There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price in future rounds, and I risk losing time and potentially the sale altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice in this situation."
