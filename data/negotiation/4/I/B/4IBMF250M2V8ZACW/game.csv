"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire a product worth a significant amount to you. I understand its value is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My starting offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to your business. Let's make this happen!",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $1,325,000. I'm still confident that's a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $1,337,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1337500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. How about we meet at $1,350,000? This price is still significantly below the product's worth to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still not willing to go above $1,325,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $1,322,500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",1322500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but I still need a bit more to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $1,320,000. This price is still incredibly valuable to you, and it ensures I don't lose out on this valuable product. Let's make this final compromise and close this deal. I don't have time for endless negotiation, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",1320000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer of $1,322,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on that price. I'm not willing to go any higher or lower.",1322500.0,Bob,8,
