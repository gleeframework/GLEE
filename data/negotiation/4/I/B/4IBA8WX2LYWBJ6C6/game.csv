"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly benefit your business. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to make a fair deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
