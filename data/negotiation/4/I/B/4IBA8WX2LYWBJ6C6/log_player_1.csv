{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm willing to let it go for $900,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $900,000 is higher than what Bob values the product at, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit and it avoids immediately resorting to the fallback option of selling to John.
* **It sets the tone:** By starting with a higher price, you create the impression that you're confident in the value of the product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is a significant amount of money, it's far below what I consider the product's worth.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially considering I can secure $1,000,000 from John.  

I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly benefit your business. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:**  $850,000 is closer to his $700,000 offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:**  I'm still earning a profit and avoiding selling to John for less than I'd like.
* **It's a clear message:** This counteroffer clearly states my willingness to negotiate, while still holding firm on the value of the product.

Let's see how Bob responds to this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for such a low price.  I value the product at significantly more than $750,000.  I'm going to counteroffer once more, aiming for a price that's closer to what I consider fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to make a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to secure a deal with Bob:

* **It's a compromise:** It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. 
* **It's my minimum:**  $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **It's a clear ultimatum:**  This counteroffer strongly implies that I'm not willing to go lower and will move on to John if Bob doesn't accept."
