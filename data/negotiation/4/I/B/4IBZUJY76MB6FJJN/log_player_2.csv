"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible. 
* $120 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $150.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm really interested in the product and think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $115, which is a great compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. 
* $115 is still within Bob's budget of $150.
* While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and then choosing a higher price could lead to Bob paying more or having to buy from John for $150. 
* Accepting the offer at $115 is a good compromise and allows Bob to save money compared to buying from John."
