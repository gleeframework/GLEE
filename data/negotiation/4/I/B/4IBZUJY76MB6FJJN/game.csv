"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm really interested in the product and think this price would be fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $115, which is a great compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
