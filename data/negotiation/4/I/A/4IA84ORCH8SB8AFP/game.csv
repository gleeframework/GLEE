"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $550,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could meet you at $700,000. This offer reflects a serious interest on my end, and I believe it would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your serious interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,5,
