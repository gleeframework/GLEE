{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'll try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest less, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $825,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to both close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll counteroffer at $845,000. This price is still a good value for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $845,000, which is very close to my last offer of $825,000.  While I'd prefer to get it for $825,000, the risk of going another round and Alice going back up in price is too high.  Also, I'm getting a decent discount from John's price of $1,000,000.  It's time to close the deal."
