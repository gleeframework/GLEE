"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're seeking a fair deal, and I'm confident this price reflects that. To avoid prolonging this, I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000. This is my final offer.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I've been very clear about the product's value to me. I offered you a significant compromise at $1,425,000, and I'm standing by that price. If you're not willing to move closer to that number, I'm afraid we're at an impasse.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
