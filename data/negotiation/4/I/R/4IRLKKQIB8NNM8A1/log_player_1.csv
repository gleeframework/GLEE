Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm still confident that Bob values the product highly enough to come up with a more agreeable offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $975000. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $975,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's lower offer."
