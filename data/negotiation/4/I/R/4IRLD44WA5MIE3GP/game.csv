"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a game-changer for you. I'm asking for $1150000, a price that reflects the value and potential of this opportunity.  Let's discuss!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit below what I need to move forward. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1100000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: $1050000 for the product, and I'll also consider taking on some additional responsibilities or risks to mitigate the cost for you. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and take on additional responsibilities. However,  $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1075000. This price reflects the value of the product and the potential benefits you'll experience. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. Can you consider this revised offer?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
