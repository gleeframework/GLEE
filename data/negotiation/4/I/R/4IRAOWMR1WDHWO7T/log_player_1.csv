Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:**  Offering a price of $20,000 first sets a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it makes it more likely he'll offer a price closer to your desired range than if you started lower.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, which gives you leverage. There's no need to desperately lowball the price to Bob.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of you, while maximizing your profit."
