"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go any lower than $10,500. It's still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,250. Can you consider this compromise?",10250.0,Bob,4,
