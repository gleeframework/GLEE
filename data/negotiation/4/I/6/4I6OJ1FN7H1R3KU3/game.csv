"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $850000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $650000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Can we meet in the middle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $700000. I'm offering the product to you for $775000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $775000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than that. How about $725000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I think we can find a sweet spot between $775000 and $725000. I'm offering the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price, considering the value and uniqueness of the product.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $750000 is the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $725000, but I'd like to propose a price of $737500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",737500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $737500. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $742500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",742500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $742500 and $725000, but I'd like to propose a price of $733750. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",733750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a last offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $733750. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm offering the product to you for $738000. This is my final counteroffer.",738000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm afraid I've reached my limit and I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'll consider other options, including buying the product from John for $1500000.",0.0,Bob,10,
