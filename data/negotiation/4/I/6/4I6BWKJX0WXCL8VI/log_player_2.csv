"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price closer to $1,000,000.  You can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation fails."
