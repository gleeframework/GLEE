"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. How about we settle around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for a great product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
