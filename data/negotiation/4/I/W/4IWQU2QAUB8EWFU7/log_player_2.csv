Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for a great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000. It's better to secure the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
