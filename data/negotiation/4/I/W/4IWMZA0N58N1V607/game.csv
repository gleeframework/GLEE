"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and I accept $950,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us and ensure we both get a good outcome.",950000.0,Alice,3,
