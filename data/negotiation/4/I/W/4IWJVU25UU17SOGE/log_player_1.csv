Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without going below our own $15,000 minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly is preferable to waiting.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John immediately."
