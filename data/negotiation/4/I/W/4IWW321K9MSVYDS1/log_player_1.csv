Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** By starting at $1,150,000, Alice anchors the negotiation closer to her desired outcome. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's more likely to settle above her $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Creating urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without much negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price that is still highly profitable for Alice.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and selling to John at $1,200,000.
* Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters the initial offer."
