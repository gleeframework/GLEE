"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise at $795,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're firm on your price, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference on our last two offers and settle at $747,500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",747500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to split the difference just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $747,500 and $795,000, which is $770,725. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",770725.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're a tough negotiator! I'm willing to go up a bit, but $770,725 is still a touch high for me. How about $755,000? That's a significant move on my end.",755000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up, but I'm not willing to go as low as $755,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $755,000 and $770,725, which is $762,862.50. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",762862.5,Alice,9,
