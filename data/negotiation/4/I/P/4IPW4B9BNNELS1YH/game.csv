"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've said it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering your stated value of $8,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $6,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to the middle ground.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $6,500 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $9,000. This is a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable value for my product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,500? That's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
