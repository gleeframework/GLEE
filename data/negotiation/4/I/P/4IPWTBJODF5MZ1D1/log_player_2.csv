"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $9,000 is above your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate and try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is not ideal:**  While you could buy from John, it's the most expensive option and doesn't allow for any negotiation. 

**Strategy:**  Reject the offer and start the counter-offer process to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** $7,000 is still within your budget and allows for potential negotiation in future rounds.

**Strategy:**  By starting with a strong counteroffer, you hope to pressure Alice into accepting a price closer to your desired range, even if it requires further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $8,500 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject and you could end up buying from John at a higher price.

**Strategy:** Accept the offer. This is a good deal for you as you're getting the product within your budget and avoiding the risk of further negotiations."
