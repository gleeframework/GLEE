Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I really need to get at least $12,000 for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

Round 7

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm afraid $8,000 is really the most I can justify spending. If you can do $8,000, the deal is yours. Otherwise, I wish you all the best."", ""product_price"": 8000}"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made one concession after another, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to make one last stand: I'll sell it to you for $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000 and we've already reached our maximum budget. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the product from John at $8,000."
