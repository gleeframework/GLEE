Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and gives me room to move. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I emphasize the value to Bob by saying it's a great deal. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Strategic Advantage:** I'm holding the possibility of selling to John at $1,200,000 as a backup, which provides me with more leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $950000 for it. Please let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Value:**  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I need to meet my goal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a higher price.
* **Leverage:**  I have the option to sell to John at $1,200,000, which strengthens my position. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I can use my counteroffer to test Bob's commitment and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above your price point.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, indicating I'm not desperate for a sale and have a fallback option with John. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the fairness and win-win aspects of the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $960000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time and Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether and potentially requiring me to accept a lower offer in the future. 
* **Profitable Deal:**  While not my ideal price, it's still a profitable deal and allows me to move on to other opportunities. 
* **Avoid Uncertainty:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but it eliminates the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob. Accepting Bob's offer provides a more certain outcome with a reasonable profit."
