Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're being sincere about your offer, but I've already told you that $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my last chance to make a deal with you, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This seems like the best move for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** $1,075,000 is significantly less than John's $1,500,000 price and a reasonable compromise from Alice's original offer. 
* **Alice is Firm:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Continuing to push could make her walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Limited Rounds:**  There are only a few rounds left. If Bob rejects this offer, he risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
