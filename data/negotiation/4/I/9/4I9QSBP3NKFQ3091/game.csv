"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to offer $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's well below the value you placed on the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. How about we settle at $10,900?  This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $10,900 is still a little higher than what I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,800? This is a fair price, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,800 is still a little lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  Let's settle at $10,850. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?",10850.0,Alice,7,
