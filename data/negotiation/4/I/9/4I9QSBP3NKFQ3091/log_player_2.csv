"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's original asking price of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. There are also 9 more rounds, giving him time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to offer $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer to maximize his potential savings.  He's aiming for a price that's close to his maximum budget but also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's well below the value you placed on the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target. He has several rounds left to negotiate, and he can still buy from John for a lower price if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate and trying to find a middle ground. He has raised his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is serious about buying the product, but also remaining firm on getting a good deal. By offering a midpoint, he's making it clear that he is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. How about we settle at $10,900?  This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still very close to his target price and has multiple rounds left to negotiate.  While $10,900 is getting closer, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He can also still purchase the product from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $10,900 is still a little higher than what I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,800? This is a fair price, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible while also showing his willingness to compromise. He is raising his offer again, but only slightly, showing that he is serious about buying the product but still wants to save money.  By offering to split the difference, he is signaling a desire to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,800 is still a little lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  Let's settle at $10,850. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only three rounds left. While he's getting close to his target price, Alice is showing that she's unwilling to go any lower.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the opportunity to buy from John, who is offering the product at Bob's desired price."
