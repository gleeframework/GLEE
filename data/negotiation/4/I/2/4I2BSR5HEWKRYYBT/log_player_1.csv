Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're putting on this product, but unfortunately $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  It's important to try to maximize my profit, and $9,500 is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is just too low. It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500.  This is a fair price, considering its value and my initial offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is the price I could get from another seller.  Let's close this deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount and I'm running out of rounds.  I'll accept his offer."
