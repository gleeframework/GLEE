"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise. Bob is demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while also showing that he's serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise.  It's still below Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, and it's only $500 more than Bob's last counteroffer. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, without risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a dead end."
