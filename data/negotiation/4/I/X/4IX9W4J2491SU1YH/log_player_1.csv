"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 if the negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $13,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more. I'm still confident that I can find a better deal, especially with the guaranteed $12,000 offer from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $11,500. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I still feel it's a reasonable price. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept, as it's closer to his last offer.  I'm trying to balance getting a good price with not risking losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, we're now in the latter half of the rounds. It's time to be more assertive. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make another counteroffer in the next round.  I believe there's still room for a better deal, and I'm not ready to settle for anything less than my target yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $11,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I still feel it's a reasonable price. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept. With only a few rounds remaining, I need to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000.  I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it's clear that we're too far apart on price. John's offer is a guaranteed profit and it's the best option at this point."
