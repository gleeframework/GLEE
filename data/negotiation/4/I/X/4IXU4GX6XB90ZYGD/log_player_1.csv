I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than half of my minimum value. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me and represents a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob while still remaining within my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $700,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob at this point. John's offer of $1,200,000 ensures I get a fair price and allows me to move on with a guaranteed sale."
