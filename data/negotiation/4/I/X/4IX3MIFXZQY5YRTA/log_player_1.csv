{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects its value. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for you to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

By offering $900,000, you are maximizing your chances of getting a good price while also being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $850,000. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows that you're still willing to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your previous offer:** This demonstrates that you're willing to adjust your price to reach an agreement.
* **It's a reasonable midpoint:** This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal while still allowing you to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I am unable to go above $850,000. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob has repeatedly refused to go higher than $850,000. This price is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to result in a more favorable outcome.  I'm confident that John will purchase the product for the full $1,000,000, which is the price I'm seeking."
