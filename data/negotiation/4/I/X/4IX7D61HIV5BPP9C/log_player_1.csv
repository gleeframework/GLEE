"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter.  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to adjust the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle that low just yet. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm not desperate to sell and have a backup option with John.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However,  $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's a deal I believe you'll be happy with."", ""product_price"": 800000}
