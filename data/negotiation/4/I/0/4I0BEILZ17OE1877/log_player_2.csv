"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. $9,000 is still a bit high.  Let's see if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Let's start with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's original offer and closer to what the product is worth to her.  Hopefully, this will encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is a bit higher than before, but still within our budget. We can still push for a lower price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

Let's try a counteroffer of $8,800. This is a compromise between our previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, but we're getting closer to an agreeable price. Let's try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

We're close now.  Let's try a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a bit higher than our last offer, but it's still a good deal for us, and it might be the price point that convinces Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting further away from our target price. With only a few rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep negotiating. It's better to secure the product from John at $10,000 than risk losing the deal altogether with Alice."
