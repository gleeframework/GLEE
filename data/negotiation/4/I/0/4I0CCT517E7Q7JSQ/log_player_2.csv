Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm seeing progress in our negotiations. However, $1,090,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to offer $1,080,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,085,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,080,000.  Given that there are only a few rounds left, and I'm nearing my target price, it's time to accept the offer.  There's a risk of going back and forth and ending up with a price higher than this, or running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price."
