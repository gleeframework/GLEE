"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a good compromise that allows both of us to get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.
