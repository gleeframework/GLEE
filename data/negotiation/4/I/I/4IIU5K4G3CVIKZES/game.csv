,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it, which is the closest I can get to the market price without breaking the bank.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135, which is a great compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to pay $125. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $140, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $100.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your honesty about considering buying it from John if we can't come to an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I can offer it to you for $145, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $145 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $137.50 for the product. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to buy it from John.",137.5,Bob,8,
