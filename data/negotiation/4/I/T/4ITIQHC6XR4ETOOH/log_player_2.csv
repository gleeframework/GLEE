Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. How about we go back to my original offer of $950,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? I'll include a premium warranty and a personalized setup service. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?

It's clear Alice is not budging significantly on price. The added extras are not worth the extra $100,000 she's trying to tack back on. John offers a guaranteed price that avoids further haggling."
