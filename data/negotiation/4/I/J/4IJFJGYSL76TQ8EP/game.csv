"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while remaining within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
