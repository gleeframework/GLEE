"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000.  This gives you a significant advantage while still allowing me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you mentioned, and it allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $1,000,000 for it. This price is fair to both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
