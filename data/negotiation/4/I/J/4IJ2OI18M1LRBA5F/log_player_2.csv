"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000.  This gives you a significant advantage while still allowing me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is only slightly higher than John's, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down a bit, especially since she states it's a ""fair price."""
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you mentioned, and it allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $1,000,000 for it. This price is fair to both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is now the same as John's offer. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as further counteroffers could potentially lead to a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice as it secures the product at the lowest possible price at this point."
