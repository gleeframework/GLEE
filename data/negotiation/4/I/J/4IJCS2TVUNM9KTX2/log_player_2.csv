"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and would love to make a deal with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  It's too early to buy from John, as John's price is the full value."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, but there's still room to negotiate. Bob can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer.  While John's price is the full value, it's still too early to buy from him, as Bob could potentially get a better deal from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $725000. This is already a concession from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,000,000.  While there's still a possibility of getting a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy at John's higher price outweighs the potential small saving. Accepting the offer at $725,000 is a good decision in this scenario."
