"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at this price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $12,500? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $12,250 is a good offer, but I need to be closer to $12,500.  How about we compromise at $12,400? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to close this deal.",12400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too close to my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",12200.0,Bob,6,
