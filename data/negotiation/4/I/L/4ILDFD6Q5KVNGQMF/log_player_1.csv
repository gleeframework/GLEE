"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price that's still higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and the opportunity it presents. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being rigid, allowing space for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round.  The key will be to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and to keep the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a slight improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to bargain.  I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, and potentially close the deal in the following rounds.
* **Strategic flexibility:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the option to sell to John for a higher price if negotiations with Bob continue to be unsuccessful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** I'm bridging the gap by dropping my price, but still maintaining a healthy profit margin.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a win-win situation, highlighting the shared benefit of closing the deal.
* **Maintain pressure:** While I've come down, I'm not giving up too much too early. I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a good price.

**Important Note:** The next steps will depend on Bob's response. If he rejects this counteroffer, I will need to assess whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or if I should sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to achieve our goals. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're now in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, I need to be more assertive in my negotiations. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I don't want to settle for less than I can get. 

**Important Note:**  I need to carefully consider my next counteroffer.  I'll need to find a price that is acceptable to me while also persuading Bob to agree. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm prepared to go down to $925,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm using the ""final offer"" tactic to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Slight compromise:** I'm making a small concession, but not giving up too much. This shows I'm flexible while still maintaining my position.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  I reiterate the shared value and potential for success in this deal.
* **Limited time:** We're in round 5, and the pressure is mounting. This helps emphasize the importance of reaching an agreement soon.

**Important Note:**  This is my final offer before considering selling to John.  If Bob rejects this, I will have to evaluate whether selling to John is the better option."
