,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to achieve our goals. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm prepared to go down to $925,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this deal now.",925000.0,Alice,5,
