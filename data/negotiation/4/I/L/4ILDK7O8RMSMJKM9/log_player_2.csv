* **Still within your budget:** $700,000 leaves you some room to negotiate further if needed. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and inform your strategy for the next rounds."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on your goal:**  Alice's offer is only $15,000 above your previous counteroffer, and closer to your desired price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing a good deal.
* **Avoiding further rounds:** Accepting now avoids the uncertainty of more rounds and the possibility of Alice becoming more stubborn.  You're still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
