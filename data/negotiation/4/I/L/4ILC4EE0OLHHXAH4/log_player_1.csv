Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we want to start significantly higher to explore the potential for maximizing profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to justify the high asking price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $2,000,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring a substantial profit for Alice.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, leveraging his valuation and the existence of a backup buyer."
