Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since the product's value to Bob is equal to your minimum acceptable price, there's room for negotiation. Starting with a higher offer ($10,000) leaves space for potential compromise while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: This phrasing subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act, potentially encouraging a quicker decision. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and open-ended (""What do you say?""), suggesting a willingness to negotiate if Bob counters.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price. This strategy maximizes your potential gain while minimizing risk."
