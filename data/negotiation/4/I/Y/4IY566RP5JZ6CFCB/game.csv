"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you and the value I place on it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's close this transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
