Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $9,150 as the final offer for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice seems to be moving in smaller increments now. It's unlikely we'll get a price significantly lower than $9,150, especially with only a few rounds remaining. Accepting this offer saves us $850 compared to John's price."
