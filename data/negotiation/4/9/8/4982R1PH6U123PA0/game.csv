"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $90. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is still a bit too steep for me, but I'm getting closer. How about $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $85. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to making a deal, but $85 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $80. This is my last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",80.0,Alice,7,
