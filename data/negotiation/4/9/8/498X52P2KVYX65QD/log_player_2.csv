{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No need to buy from John yet:**  John's offer is your maximum, so there's no immediate urgency to buy from him. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Alice's initial offer is your maximum, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Gathering information:** By rejecting, you can start to understand Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive first counteroffer:**  Starting with a significantly lower price (a 33% reduction) shows your seriousness about negotiating and forces Alice to consider a lower price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While $1,000,000 is a significant drop, there's still room for a compromise. 
* **Exploring Alice's willingness:** This will gauge if Alice is willing to negotiate meaningfully or if she's firm on a higher price."

{""product_price"": 1100000}

* **Testing Alice's bottom line:** This counteroffer gauges how close Alice is to your desired price point.
* **Preparing for a potential compromise:** If Alice accepts, you've saved $400,000; if she rejects, you can still adjust your counteroffer in the next round."
