Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and signals the value you place on the product. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's essential to gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes a collaborative approach, making it clear that you're willing to discuss the price and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind you have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you don't settle for anything less than your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. I am interested in purchasing the product for $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have the security of selling to John at your desired price. Therefore, it makes sense to negotiate further with Bob before accepting an offer below your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** While we're closer to your minimum, a significant reduction from your initial offer might signal desperation. This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate without drastically dropping the price.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob of its worth. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" aims to make it more appealing to Bob and encourage him to accept. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** Remember, you have a backup offer from John, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further haggling could sour the deal. Accepting this offer secures you a significant profit."
