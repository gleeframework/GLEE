{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, but still leaves you with a profit of $2,000, which is better than selling to John for $8,000.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to our minimum price, but we can still try to get a better price.  We'll counter his offer with a price closer to our original $10,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
