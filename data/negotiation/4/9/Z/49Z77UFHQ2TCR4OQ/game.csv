"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1350000. This offer reflects the value I place on this product and the potential I see in it for you.  Let's continue this discussion and see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000.
