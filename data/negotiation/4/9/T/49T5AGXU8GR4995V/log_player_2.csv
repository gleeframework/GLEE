{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still provides a good margin for both of us. This price allows for a win-win situation and ensures you can leverage the product's potential to its fullest.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 still doesn't fully capture the value this product offers. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal and unlock the product's potential together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,025,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. You've shown your willingness to negotiate, and Alice is likely eager to close the deal.  Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to push for a lower price. With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on Alice to make a deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer and reflects a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  Let's work together to finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close.  $975,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this valuable asset. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is a good price considering you are only 3 rounds away from needing to purchase from John at a much higher price.  It is likely that Alice would be unwilling to go any lower, as she is already below her desired price point.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price, maximizing your savings and meeting your goal."
