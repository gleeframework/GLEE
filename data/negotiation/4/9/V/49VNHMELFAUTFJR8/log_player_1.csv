"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for some profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe there's potential for a higher price and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500. This is a slightly higher offer than Bob's last proposal, but it shows I'm willing to meet him halfway. With only five rounds left, I need to find a balance between securing a good price and not risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd still prefer a higher price, we're running out of time.  $17,000 is a decent profit and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's time to accept Bob's offer."
