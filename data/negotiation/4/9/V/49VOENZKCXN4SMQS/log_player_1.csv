"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,100,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit that is significantly closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000.  

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price, observing Bob's reactions and counteroffers.  If Bob doesn't budge, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a higher price.  However, if the negotiations don't progress favorably, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's a step in the right direction.

**Strategy:**

By offering a lower price, I hope to incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price.  This is still a high price, and I'm confident that Bob will likely counter-offer again, giving me the opportunity to further negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still significantly lower than my preferred outcome. I have limited rounds left, but there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to close the gap between our desired prices. However, I'm closely monitoring the number of rounds remaining and the potential for reaching a mutually agreeable price. If the negotiations don't progress favorably, I will move to sell to John to ensure I secure at least my minimum value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000, making another significant concession.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable deal. 

**Strategy:**

With only 5 rounds left, I need to balance finding a compromise with Bob and not settling for too low a price. I believe $1,000,000 is a fair middle ground, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.  With only 4 rounds left, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob are slim.

**Strategy:**

It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  I've tried negotiating with Bob, but his offers are too low.  Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum requirement and avoid the risk of getting a significantly lower price."
