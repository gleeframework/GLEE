"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I had hoped to spend. How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make a profit on this sale. $13,000 is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
