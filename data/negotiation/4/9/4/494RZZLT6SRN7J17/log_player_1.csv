{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than his initial value of $100, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love the product!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $102 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $102 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to be fair.  Let's split the difference - how about $106?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $106 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. That's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I've tried to negotiate, but it seems like we're at an impasse.  Rather than continue to haggle, I'm going to sell to John for $120. It's a better deal for me, and I'm confident I can find another buyer for this product in the future."
