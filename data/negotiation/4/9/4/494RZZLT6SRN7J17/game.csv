"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to be fair.  Let's split the difference - how about $106?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",106.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $106 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. That's my absolute limit.",100.0,Bob,6,
