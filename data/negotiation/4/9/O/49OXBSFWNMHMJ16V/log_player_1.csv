"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,750,000.  This is still above my minimum, but I'm showing some flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can come to a more reasonable agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but I still need to maintain a price that's closer to my minimum. We're getting into the later rounds now, so I need to strike a balance between being flexible and staying firm on my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a little more.  This is my final offer before considering selling to John.  If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John to ensure I don't lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're down to the wire and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower price, especially with John offering my minimum. This ensures I get a fair price for my product."
