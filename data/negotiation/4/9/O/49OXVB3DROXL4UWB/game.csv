"I'm very interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $900000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000, and that's my final offer. I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher than that. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $875000. I'm willing to go up to $860000, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to pay any more than that. What do you think?",860000.0,Bob,6,
