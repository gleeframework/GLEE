"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the product. I appreciate your offer, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider offering the product for $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? How about $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1075000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Could we possibly settle on $1062500?",1062500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1075000, but I'm also willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a premium support package, which adds significant value to the product. I think this is a fair price considering the extras",1075000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate the additional value you're offering with the warranty and support package. However, based on my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $1065000 for the product.",1065000.0,Bob,10,
