"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate, but I want to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering a price closer to my desired price of $150. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if we can't come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a little lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm also starting to feel the pressure of possibly having to sell to John, which is a good outcome, but not my ideal scenario.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal altogether."
