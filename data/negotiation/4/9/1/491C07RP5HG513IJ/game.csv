"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product looks great, $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?  I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for such a great product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is too low.  How about $140? That's a fair compromise.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for this product, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
