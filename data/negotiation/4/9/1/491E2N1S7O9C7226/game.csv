"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and would allow us to both walk away happy.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
