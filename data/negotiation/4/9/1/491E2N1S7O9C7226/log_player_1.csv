"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting high (significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value) establishes a strong negotiating position. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** This offer provides ample room for negotiation over the subsequent rounds, allowing you to strategically lower the price while still aiming for a final sale price significantly above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" you subtly justify the high asking price without revealing your own valuation.

The goal is to gauge Bob's initial reaction and understand how eager he is to purchase the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's too early to accept. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate a better deal. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about getting a higher price and are willing to walk away if necessary. This sets the stage for a potentially more favorable counter-offer from you in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (Slightly):** You've come down from your initial high offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Strong:** However, the $1,900,000 counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's offer and comfortably above your minimum price. This keeps the pressure on Bob to justify his lower valuation.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Tactic:** This classic negotiation technique can be psychologically persuasive, even though you're not truly splitting the difference in your own mind.  

The goal is to bring Bob closer to your desired price range while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and would allow us to both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. 

Here's why accepting now is a good strategy:

* **Profitable Deal:** You're securing a profit of $550,000, which is a significant gain.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the possibility of not reaching a better agreement with Bob.
* **Bird in Hand:** You have a guaranteed offer in hand. Holding out for a potentially slightly better offer from Bob carries the risk that he might lower his offer or walk away entirely. 

It's always tempting to try to squeeze out a bit more, but in this case, accepting Bob's offer represents a solid and secure win."
