"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  If you're serious about purchasing, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is already a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",130.0,Alice,3,
