"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a premium price of $150. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $150.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  If you're serious about purchasing, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is already a very competitive price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is better than $150, you are still paying more than the product is worth to you.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before resorting to John."
