Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you know about Bob's personality (e.g., is he prone to negotiation?), you might choose a different starting price."
