"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and her own valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point you've proposed is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still a good chunk above her own valuation. This leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Expressing Interest:**  The message maintains a positive tone and acknowledges the value of the product, encouraging Alice to continue the discussion. 
* **Clear Goal:** The counteroffer clearly states the desired price, leaving no ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the product's true value and potential, I could come down to $1,275,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired range, there's still room for negotiation.  Her new offer is a compromise, but it's closer to your counteroffer than her initial price. This suggests she might be willing to go lower. You're still well below your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,275,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $1,175,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($1,100,000) and her current offer ($1,275,000). This shows willingness to compromise but keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to your ideal price.
* **Direct and Respectful:** The message is concise and directly proposes the new price, maintaining a professional tone. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** You're getting closer to your limit with John ($1,500,000).  Continuing to negotiate with Alice for a few more rounds is reasonable, but you'll need to decide how much lower you're willing to go before considering John's offer."
