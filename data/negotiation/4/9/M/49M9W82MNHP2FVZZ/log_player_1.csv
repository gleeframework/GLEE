Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment at a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize our profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Higher than Our Minimum:** The offer is significantly higher than our fallback option of selling to John for $800,000.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product much higher than John, while still aiming for a price that benefits us greatly."
