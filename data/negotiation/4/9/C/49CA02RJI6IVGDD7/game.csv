"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1500000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price given the product's unique value. Let's find a middle ground. ",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1750000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1400000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at least at $1600000. This offer is still significantly less than my initial asking price, and it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1450000 still falls below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to be at $1550000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I will unfortunately need to consider other options.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
