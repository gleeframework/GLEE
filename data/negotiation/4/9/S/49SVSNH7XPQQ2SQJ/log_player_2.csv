"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. After considering our positions, I am willing to accept a price of $8750 for the product. This allows for a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $8,750, which is very close to your target of $8,500.
* Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it's likely to be a small difference.
* You're already saving $1,250 compared to John's offer.
* There's a risk of Alice walking away or you being forced to buy from John at a higher price.

Therefore, accepting the offer at $8,750 is the most sensible choice, balancing a good price with minimizing risk."
