"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I'm confident it will be of significant value to you, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm asking for $1,300,000, a price that reflects its value and my own investment in it. I'm open to reasonable negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value and my investment in it. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and your investment in it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
