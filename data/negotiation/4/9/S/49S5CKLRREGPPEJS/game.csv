"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17500.  It's a significant discount from my original offer and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $17500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This is a fair price for both of us and keeps the negotiation moving.  Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
