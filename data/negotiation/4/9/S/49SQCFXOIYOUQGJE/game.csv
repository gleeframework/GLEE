"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. I'm confident you'll find this price attractive, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it still gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,025,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my new offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
