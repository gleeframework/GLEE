"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still leaves room for you to profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $1,325,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but no more. Can you consider this price?",1320000.0,Bob,6,
