"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $90.  That means there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $85?  I'm very interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $87.50, which is the best I can do. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now offering $87.50, which is still within my budget of $120 and a better price than John's offer. It's also closer to my initial counteroffer of $85. It's a good deal, so I'll accept."
