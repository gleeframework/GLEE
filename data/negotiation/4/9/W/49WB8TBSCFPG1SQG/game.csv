"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's work together to make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
