Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob's value is unknown. This will give me some room to negotiate down if needed.  If he rejects, I can gauge his interest by his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and even lower than the guaranteed sale price with John. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product while also leaving a small margin for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident that I can negotiate a higher price with him.  At this point, it's better to accept the guaranteed sale price from John and avoid further negotiation."
