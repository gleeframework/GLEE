{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer because I can get more from John.  Although $80 is better than nothing, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's initial offer.  Hopefully, he'll find it reasonable."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  John is my backup option, so I'm not under pressure to sell to Bob yet."

I'm lowering my price again to $90. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're getting closer to a deal and accept this offer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up.  I'd rather sell to John for $100 than risk getting stuck with a price that's lower than I'd like."
