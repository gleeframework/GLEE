Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so I can likely get a price closer to that than my minimum.
* **My Backup:**  John's offer of $12,000 provides a safety net.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price. He still gets a good deal, and I get a higher price than my minimum."
