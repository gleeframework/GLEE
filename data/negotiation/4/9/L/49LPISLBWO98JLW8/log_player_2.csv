"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, considering its potential benefits. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high. Since I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000, there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering the value to me, $900,000 would be a fair price. This allows for a good margin for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would allow me to cover my costs and still achieve a good profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $950,000 is still above my target. I believe there's still room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the process and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
