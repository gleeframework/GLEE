"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a much better deal. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far too low. This product is worth a lot to the right buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I could go up to $7,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While getting $7,000 from Bob is tempting, it's clear he's unlikely to go much higher. Selling to John guarantees the $10,000, which is the best outcome at this point."
