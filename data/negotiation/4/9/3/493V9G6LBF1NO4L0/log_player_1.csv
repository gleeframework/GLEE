Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a higher price.

Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you can always choose to accept a counteroffer or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a decent amount, it's still below your desired price.  You can try to get closer to your goal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,750?  That leaves us both with some room to compromise and hopefully we can seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,750 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price, $10,000 is a fair offer that's close to your desired range. It's also likely that Bob won't budge further, so accepting his offer is the best option to secure the sale and avoid the risk of him walking away entirely."
