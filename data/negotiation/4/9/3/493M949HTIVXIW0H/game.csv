"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, the product's value to me is considerably higher. I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,050,000.  This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
