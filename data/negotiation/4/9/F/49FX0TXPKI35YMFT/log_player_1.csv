Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $150, so offering it below that is pointless.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is only willing to pay up to $120.
* **John's guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to maximize profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to consider. Here's why:

* **Above Bob's valuation but negotiable:** The $145 offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, but there's room for negotiation. 
* **Close to your guaranteed price:** It's close to your $150 guarantee, minimizing potential losses if Bob rejects the offer.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great! You make a profit and the deal is done.
* **Bob counter-offers:** This opens negotiations, and you can potentially still settle above your $150 minimum.
* **Bob rejects:**  No problem! You sell to John at your guaranteed price."
