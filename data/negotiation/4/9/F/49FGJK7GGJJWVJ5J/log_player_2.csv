This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're close to your limit:**  At $79.50, you're just under your $100 maximum and have negotiated a significant discount.
* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Further negotiation risks:** If you push too hard, Alice might walk away, and you'll have to buy from John at full price."
