{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it will be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to leave room for negotiation. It's important to be positive and highlight the value of the product to Bob. By starting at $15,000, you can potentially earn more than your minimum of $12,000, but you still have room to drop the price if necessary.  

Remember, this is just the first offer.  The negotiation will be dynamic based on Bob's responses. Be prepared to adjust your strategy depending on how the conversation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a price closer to $10000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before accepting his offer or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with $12000. This feels like a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum acceptable price, and it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.  While I could potentially continue to negotiate, accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and saves time."
