"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
