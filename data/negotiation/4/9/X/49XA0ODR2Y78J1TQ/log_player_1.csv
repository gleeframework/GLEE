Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is above my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. Bob is showing interest, and I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
``` 

I'm offering a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $78. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is tempting, I believe I can still push for a better deal.  I'm not too far from my minimum price of $80, and I'm confident I can convince Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $78 is still a bit below my desired price. Would you consider $80? That would be a fair price for both of us, and it would ensure a successful transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at my minimum price of $80. I'm emphasizing fairness and a successful transaction to encourage Bob to accept."
