"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're trying to work with me.  While $12500 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice is now asking for $13,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative at a lower price, it makes sense to take it."
