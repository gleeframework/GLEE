Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him a reason to consider it, knowing he can get a deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This provides room for negotiation, allowing you to potentially secure a better price.
* **It's realistic:** It's not too far off from his value, making it believable for him to potentially accept.

This strategy allows for flexibility. If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $13500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. However, it is closer to my minimum than his initial valuation. This suggests there is room for further negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're trying to work with me.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
