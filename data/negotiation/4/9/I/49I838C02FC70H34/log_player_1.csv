Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000.  Would you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product is quite high.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $15,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. I could stretch my budget to $11,000, but that's really the most I can offer.  It's a fair offer considering it's a good bit above what I could get it for elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk getting a lower offer or running out of rounds with Bob."
