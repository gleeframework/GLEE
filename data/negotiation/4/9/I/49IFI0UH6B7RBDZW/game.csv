"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the features and benefits you've described, and I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this caliber. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of its value. In light of your counteroffer, I am proposing a compromise.

I look forward to your response and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $875000. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm going to make one last offer of $850000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept the offer and purchase the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",850000.0,Bob,8,
