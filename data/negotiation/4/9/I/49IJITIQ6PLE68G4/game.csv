"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, now's the time to make a decision.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go to $13000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck on price, but I'm still interested in selling to you. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit above where I can go right now.  I'm willing to go to $13000, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
