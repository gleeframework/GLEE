"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's a game-changer, and I know it'll be a huge asset for your business. I'm confident it's worth $1000000 to you, but I'm willing to start with a price of $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $850000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the immense value of this product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit high. While I believe in this product's potential, I need to make sure the price aligns with my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground.  What are your thoughts?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $875000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there.  Considering the value this product brings, and the potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $890000. This offer is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $890000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  To make this deal work, I need to get the price down to $865000.  This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's explore this option and see if we can close the deal.",865000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $865000.  It's crucial for me to secure a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $880000?  This offer is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  It's a great deal for you, and it ensures I receive a price closer to my valuation. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,7,
