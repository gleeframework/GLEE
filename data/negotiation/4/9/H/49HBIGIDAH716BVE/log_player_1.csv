Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's a game-changer, and I know it'll be a huge asset for your business.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $850000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, and Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below that.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to try and negotiate a higher price.  
* **John is a backup:**  While John's offer is my absolute minimum, I can always go back to him if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the immense value of this product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit high. While I believe in this product's potential, I need to make sure the price aligns with my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground.  What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $875,000 is closer to my desired price range, it's still below my absolute minimum of $800,000. 
* **Time to negotiate:** There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I want to push for a price closer to my valuation.
* **John is still an option:** If I can't secure a better price with Bob, I can always sell to John.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000, but I'll be prepared to make concessions if necessary."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $890000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  To make this deal work, I need to get the price down to $865000.  This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's explore this option and see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is close, it's still below my desired price range and my minimum threshold of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** We have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better deal. 
* **John is my backup:**  While $800,000 from John is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept this offer unless I'm forced to.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $880,000. I'm prepared to make a small concession, but I want to get as close to my target as possible."
