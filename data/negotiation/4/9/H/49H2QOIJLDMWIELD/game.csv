"Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,175,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I can't go any higher than $1,150,000.  This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
