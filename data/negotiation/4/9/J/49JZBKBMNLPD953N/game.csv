"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,180,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1180000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,180,000 is a tempting price, I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, and I'd like to propose $1,220,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1220000.0,Alice,3,
