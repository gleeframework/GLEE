"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and offers you a great opportunity for significant return."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the price in Bob's mind at a higher point.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate downwards. Even if he counters, it's likely to be above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth and potential, justifying the high asking price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and leaving space for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my target price and his perceived value.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Flexibility:** By rejecting, I show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Accepting his first counteroffer could signal I'm willing to concede too much, too quickly.
* **Aim for a Better Deal:** There's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range. 

I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident this product can generate significant returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows Bob I'm willing to move from my initial price and find a compromise.
* **Strong but Fair:** $1,250,000 is a significant jump from Bob's offer, but it's still a price that allows him a considerable profit margin based on his valuation.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is still a bit rich for my budget. Could we settle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's interested.  However, $1,175,000 is still too low.  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm willing to push a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's make this happen â€“ how about $1,210,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1210000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer maintains a strong position while still offering a price that allows Bob a good profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating it's my final offer, I introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept rather than risk reaching an impasse. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a smaller concession this round to signal I'm getting closer to my bottom line.

This offer balances my desire for maximum profit with the need to close the deal with Bob before he walks away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, I do see the value.  However, that final offer is just outside my budget. I could make this work at $1,190,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,190,000 is very close to my previous offer and represents a significant profit. While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting this offer:

* **Secures a Strong Profit:** $1,190,000 is well above my minimum acceptable price and provides a healthy return.
* **Avoids Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Bob or losing the opportunity to sell at this price point.
* **Saves Time and Effort:** Accepting now brings a swift and successful conclusion to the negotiation. 

Although I could potentially earn slightly more by pushing further, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward at this point."
