"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount, considering its value to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer to see if I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $80. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Alice is meeting me closer to my price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try pushing a bit further down before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $82? That's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 82
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering my costs and the value you place on the product, how does $83 sound as a compromise? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle. At this point, the difference between $83 and potentially getting her lower is probably not worth the risk of her walking away from the deal. It's a good price and time to buy!"
