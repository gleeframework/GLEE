"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's discuss further!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still hoping for a higher price, but $1,250,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but I'm also committed to getting a fair deal for my product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,175,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! I see your commitment to finding a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $1,187,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1187500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up to $1,180,000, but that's my absolute top offer.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further delays.",1180000.0,Bob,8,
