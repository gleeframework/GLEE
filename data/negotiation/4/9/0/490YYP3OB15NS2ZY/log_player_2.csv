"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's discuss further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try to lower the price further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still hoping for a higher price, but $1,250,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but I'm also committed to getting a fair deal for my product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price to $1,200,000, but Bob still has room to negotiate.  He can try for a lower price, aiming for a deal that's closer to $1,150,000.  There are still rounds left, so it's worth exploring if a compromise is possible."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,187,500 is close to Bob's target price, but he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are only a few rounds left, and Bob can potentially save even more by continuing to negotiate. It's worth trying to push for a price closer to $1,175,000."
