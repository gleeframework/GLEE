"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is interesting, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, recognizing the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your willingness to engage.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a good compromise given our current positions. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
