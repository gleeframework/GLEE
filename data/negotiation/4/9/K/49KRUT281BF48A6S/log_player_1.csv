"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob to justify the price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This opening offer allows for several rounds of back-and-forth, giving me the best chance to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Plan B:**  Remember, I can always go with John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  I have 10 rounds, and I want to see if I can push Bob higher. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $800,000. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $950,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to get a great deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm not dropping too much from my previous offer, but I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, subtly implying that $900,000 is still a good deal. 
* **Focus on finding common ground:**  This approach encourages Bob to see the benefits of continuing the negotiation. 
* **Plan B is still in place:** Remember, if Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I have 7 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  If things don't work out with Bob, I can always sell to John for $800,000. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop to $890,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (almost):** I'm dropping my offer, but not by much, showing that I'm still serious about getting a good price.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the price as a win-win scenario for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Keeping some room for negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room to reach a final agreement.
* **Maintaining the safety net:**  If Bob rejects, John's offer of $800,000 is still available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $880,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Limited time:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I want to avoid the risk of running out of time and being forced to accept John's offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I'm accepting this offer, it's not a final deal. I might be able to renegotiate for a slightly higher price in the next few rounds.

I'm taking a calculated risk by accepting this offer. However, I believe it's the best option considering the current circumstances."
