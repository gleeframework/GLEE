"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is my best price, so I hope you'll consider it.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $10,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
