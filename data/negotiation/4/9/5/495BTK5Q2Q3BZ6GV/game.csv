,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1200000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1300000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1250000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $1350000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close.  I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be at least at $1320000 to make this deal work for me. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product to you. It's time to finalize this transaction. Let me know your decision.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
