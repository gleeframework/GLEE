"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $500000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $500000 is too low for me to consider. Considering the product's unique features and the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $1200000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still concerned about reaching a price that fits within my budget.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's unique features and the value it brings, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering a revised price of $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
