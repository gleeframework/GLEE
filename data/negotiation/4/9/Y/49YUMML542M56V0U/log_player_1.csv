"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a price of $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I truly believe this product is worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but $1,300,000 is still below my acceptable range. I'm willing to risk a couple more rounds to see if we can meet in the middle.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price or sell to John for my minimum if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,300,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000.  This price is still within my acceptable range, and I hope it's fair for you as well."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are consistently lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price than risk ending up with a lower price or not reaching an agreement at all."
