"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000, so I'm offering $825,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",825000.0,Bob,4,
