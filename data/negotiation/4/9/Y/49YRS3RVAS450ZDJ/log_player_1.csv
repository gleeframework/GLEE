I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us: 

* **For Bob:** It's a lower price than he'd be willing to pay to John, allowing him to save $1,000.
* **For me:** I get to sell the product for a higher price than my absolute minimum, earning $1,000 more than selling to John. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll happily sell the product to John for $12,000, but I'm hoping we can strike a deal that benefits both of us."
