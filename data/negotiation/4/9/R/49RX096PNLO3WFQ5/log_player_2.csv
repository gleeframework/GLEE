"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is way above his target of $800,000.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  While the product is interesting, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know if you'd be interested in working with that figure."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than $850,000 based on my assessment. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,025,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,025,000 is still above Bob's target of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely secure a better deal by rejecting and making another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value I place on the product and my current budget, I'm prepared to offer $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm willing to make one final concession at $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go considering the product's potential.  If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, $980,000 is still above Bob's target of $800,000. Bob has already made a counteroffer of $950,000, and rejecting this offer gives him the opportunity to counter again and potentially land a price closer to his target.  There's still room for a deal, and Bob shouldn't settle for a price that's significantly higher than what he's comfortable with."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're at your limit, but $980,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm ready to make a final offer of $960,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 960000}
