**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the negotiation is progressing too slowly. Accepting his current offer of $960,000 would mean a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. It's unlikely Bob will bridge that gap quickly enough to be worth the risk of continued negotiation."
