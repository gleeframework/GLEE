"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm offering it to you at $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below my asking price. I could meet you halfway at $16,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant at $16,000. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can make this work within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,
