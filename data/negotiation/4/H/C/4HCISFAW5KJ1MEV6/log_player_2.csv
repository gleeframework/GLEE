Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with a price of $825500. This is a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $825,500 is only slightly higher than Bob's previous offer.  While it's technically within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount over his ideal price.  Since Bob has only 3 rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees Bob the product at his preferred price."
