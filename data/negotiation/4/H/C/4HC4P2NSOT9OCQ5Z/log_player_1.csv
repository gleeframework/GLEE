"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal quickly.  If Bob rejects, I'll see how low he's willing to go before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, so I'm rejecting it. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125.  This is still above my minimum, but I'm willing to come down a little to try and get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm going to counter with $122. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still above my minimum, and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to consider."
