Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect your valuation, I am still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. My maximum budget remains at $975,000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to what I want, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $975,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not enough.  I've had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like I'm not going to be able to get more from Bob.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's acceptable to me.  It's time to move on."
