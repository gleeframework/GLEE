"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, recognizing your interest in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect your valuation, I am still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. My maximum budget remains at $975,000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $975,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,025,000. This is my best possible offer given my budget constraints. I hope this aligns with your needs.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
