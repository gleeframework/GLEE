"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for your product.  However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. This product is truly special and holds significant value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1400000. Let's meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1300000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is closer, but still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1350000.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1350000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $1325000. This would be a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for the potential value of this product.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario here!",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1325000 is still a little low for me.  To make this work for both of us, how about we split the difference and settle on $1337500?  I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you, and this price reflects its potential.",1337500.0,Alice,7,
