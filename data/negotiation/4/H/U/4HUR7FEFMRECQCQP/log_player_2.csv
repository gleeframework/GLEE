"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $1,000,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to assess your perception of the product's value by stating ""It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you"". This suggests she might be willing to go lower.
* You have a fallback option with John at $1,200,000.  There's no rush to accept Alice's first offer. 

By rejecting, you might prompt Alice to offer a lower price, getting you a better deal."
