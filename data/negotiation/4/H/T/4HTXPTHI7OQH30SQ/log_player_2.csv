"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000 given its potential worth.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $800,000 limit.
* **Anchoring:** This counteroffer establishes a lower price point in the negotiation, potentially influencing Alice to adjust her expectations downwards more drastically.
* **Gauging Seriousness:**  A strong counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is quite below what I had in mind, I'm willing to work with you. How about we consider a price of $1,100,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice moved down a bit, $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than both our target price and our alternative option with John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to counter suggests there's still room for negotiation. We need to signal that we're serious buyers but won't accept a price that far exceeds our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be realistic, my absolute maximum is $700,000.  If you're unable to meet that price, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer (Slightly):**  We've bumped our offer to $700,000, showing movement but staying firmly below John's price. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes that $700,000 is our absolute limit, setting a clear boundary while still expressing a desire to make a deal.
* **Introducing Alternative:** By mentioning ""other options,"" we remind Alice that we have a viable alternative, creating a sense of urgency without resorting to a direct threat."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $700,000 significantly undervalues what this product can do for you. I've considered your points, and to be fair, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has presented this as her best and final offer, signaling she's unlikely to move much lower.
* **Above Budget:**  Even with her compromise, $950,000 is still significantly higher than our $800,000 budget and what John is offering.
* **No More Room:**  Continuing to negotiate risks souring the deal and wasting time, especially since we have a reliable alternative.

**It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John for $800,000. This ensures we stay within budget and acquire the product.**"
