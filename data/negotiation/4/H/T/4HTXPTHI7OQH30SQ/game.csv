"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is quite below what I had in mind, I'm willing to work with you. How about we consider a price of $1,100,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be realistic, my absolute maximum is $700,000.  If you're unable to meet that price, I might have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $700,000 significantly undervalues what this product can do for you. I've considered your points, and to be fair, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",950000.0,Alice,5,
