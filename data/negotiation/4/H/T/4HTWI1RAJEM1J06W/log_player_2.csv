Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my original asking price. How about we settle at $970,000? This allows us both to move from our initial positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Alice's offer again, as $970,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Alice is willing to meet me.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $970,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
