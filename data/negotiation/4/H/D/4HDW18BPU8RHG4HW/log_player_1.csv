Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys from you.
* **The Goal:** Maximize your profit by getting as close to $1,200,000 as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This offer is high but still leaves Bob with a $50,000 potential profit, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message focuses on the product's ""unique value"" and ""return on investment,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Exclusivity:**  The word ""exclusive"" adds a touch of urgency and desirability.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could try a slightly higher price (closer to $1,200,000) to see if Bob is willing to pay even more. However, the higher you go, the greater the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
