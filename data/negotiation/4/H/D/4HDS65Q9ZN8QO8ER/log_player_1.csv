Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $70, as it's worth more than $80 to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your perspective, $70 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $75 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider meeting me at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $75 is still below my minimum.  How about we compromise at $80? This way, we both get a fair price and I can avoid selling to John.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. How about $78? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to save a bit more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I've already reached round 6 and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price.  To be safe, I'll take John's offer of $80. It's better than selling to Bob at $78, and I'm guaranteed a sale."
