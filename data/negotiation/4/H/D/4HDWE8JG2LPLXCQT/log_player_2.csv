"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I'm capped at $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,800. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $9,200. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my profit margins. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $9,200 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's tempting to accept, you only have 5 rounds left and you could potentially get a better deal. You should continue to negotiate and see if you can get Alice to lower the price even further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm committed to making this deal work, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price that keeps us both happy.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're making a serious offer, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to the deal. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $9,100. This is as close to your offer as I can get without sacrificing my profit margins. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, you only have 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's likely that you won't be able to get Alice to budge any further.  Buying from John for $8,000 is the safest option, as it guarantees you get the product at your desired price."
