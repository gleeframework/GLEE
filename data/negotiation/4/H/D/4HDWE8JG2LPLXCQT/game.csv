"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I'm capped at $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon. What do you think?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,800. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $9,200. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my profit margins. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm committed to making this deal work, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price that keeps us both happy.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a serious offer, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to the deal. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $9,100. This is as close to your offer as I can get without sacrificing my profit margins. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,7,
