Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $127.50? This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
