"Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This unique item is not just a possession; it's a testament to craftsmanship and excellence that I believe could significantly impact your life or business in ways unforeseen.

Considering its unparalleled quality and the experiences it has been a part of, I am extending this offer to you at a price of $2000000. I understand that this might be a substantial amount, but I trust that upon closer inspection, you will appreciate its true worth and consider it a worthwhile investment.

Should you find this proposal intriguing, I would be more than happy to discuss the details further and arrange for a viewing or demonstration of the product. If you decide against it, please know that I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase the item for $1500000.

Looking forward to your response and the possibility of sharing this remarkable piece with someone who will cherish it as much as I have.

Best regards,
Alice",2000000.0,Alice,1,
