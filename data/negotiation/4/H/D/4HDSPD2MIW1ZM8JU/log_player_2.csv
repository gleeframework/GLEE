"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great price considering the potential return on your investment. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. How about $1050000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you considering the potential benefits. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice, trying to get an even better price. I'll offer $980,000, which is a bit lower than my previous offer, but still a significant amount considering the product's value to me.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. How about $980,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you."", ""product_price"": 980000}"
