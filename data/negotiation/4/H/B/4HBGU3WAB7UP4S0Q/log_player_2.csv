"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it at a price lower than you were willing to pay, and I'll still make a profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a lower price."
