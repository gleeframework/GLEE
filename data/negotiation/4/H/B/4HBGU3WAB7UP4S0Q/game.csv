"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it at a price lower than you were willing to pay, and I'll still make a profit. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000.  This is still a good profit for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal, and still allows me to reach my target. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
