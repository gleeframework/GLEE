Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to maximize potential profit.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $100 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the message in a positive way to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal whether he's interested in the product at all.
* **Start a Negotiation:** If he's interested, we can negotiate from this starting point.
* **Have a Backup Plan:** I can always sell to John for $80 if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** While $80 is my minimum, I'd prefer to earn more if possible.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob is already willing to pay close to my minimum.  I believe there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price to see if I can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Midpoint:**  $90 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a fair compromise.
* **Incentive:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I really appreciate it. Could we possibly work towards $85? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum of $80.
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject and make another counteroffer, there's a risk Bob will walk away or become less interested.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer, and I can always sell to John for $80 if this doesn't work out.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale for $85, which is a good outcome considering my minimum."
