"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To try to meet in the middle, I'd like to offer the product at $110. This is still above its value to me, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering its worth to you. Please let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
