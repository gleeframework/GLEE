"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it's a great value for you too. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a price of $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $120 is still a bit high, and you can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To try to meet in the middle, I'd like to offer the product at $110. This is still above its value to me, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering its worth to you. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within your budget and a good deal considering your goal is to save as much as possible.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product without having to go to John and pay $150."
