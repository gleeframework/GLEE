Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives Bob a sense that you value the product and aren't desperate to sell. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's not too aggressive:** By starting with a higher price, you leave room for negotiation without risking losing Bob's interest immediately.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that maximizes your profit while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and potentially leaves room for a better deal. It's also close to John's offer. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer aims to meet Bob halfway:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows Bob you're willing to compromise, but not completely give in.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **It's still a good profit for you:** This ensures you're not selling the product at a significant loss compared to your desired price.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's still a good profit margin for you, and further negotiation might not be worth the risk. Continuing to reject and counteroffer risks losing Bob entirely, especially as John is waiting in the wings. Accepting the $875,000 offer ensures a successful sale and keeps the negotiation positive."
