"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,750. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,750. I'm willing to meet you at $12,200, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. I think you'll find it's worth the extra $450.",12200.0,Alice,5,
