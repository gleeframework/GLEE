"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $1000000 on this purchase. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm proposing a counter-counteroffer of $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counter-counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $1250000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept below my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1150000 for the product. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial for me to explore other options. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. However, if not, I'll have to consider other opportunities.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $1175000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable and lead to a successful transaction.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
