"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $12,000. This is a final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to another buyer if this doesn't work out. It's a fair price for the value of the product, and I believe it's worth considering.",12000.0,Alice,5,
