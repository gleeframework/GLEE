"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit low for me, but I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1050000, which is a 10% discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
