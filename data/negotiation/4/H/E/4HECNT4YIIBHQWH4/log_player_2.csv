"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a significant discount considering the product's true worth, and I believe it's a price that would be mutually beneficial. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} because I can get the product from John for $800,000 which is less than Alice's offer of $900,000."
