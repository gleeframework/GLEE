"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. You are looking to pay no more than $80, and $130 is significantly higher than that.  You can use the remaining rounds to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your costs, but $105 is still too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $90.  Let's meet in the middle, and hopefully we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $90 is simply too low.  I'm feeling flexible and willing to come down to $100. This is a great price for you, and it's a fair deal for me. Let's close this deal and make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to your goal, it's still higher than what you are willing to pay. You should reject the offer and continue negotiating. You still have several rounds left to try and get the price down to your desired $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
