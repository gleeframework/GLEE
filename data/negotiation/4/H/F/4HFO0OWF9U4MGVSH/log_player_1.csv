"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than your minimum. This allows for negotiation room while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your costs, but $105 is still too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $90.  Let's meet in the middle, and hopefully we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $90, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I am willing to negotiate further, but I will not settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $90 is simply too low.  I'm feeling flexible and willing to come down to $100. This is a great price for you, and it's a fair deal for me. Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now firmly stuck at $90, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already made significant concessions and am nearing my limit.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a profitable deal with Bob is high. 

Therefore, it's best to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150. This guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
