"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your costs, but $105 is still too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $90.  Let's meet in the middle, and hopefully we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $90 is simply too low.  I'm feeling flexible and willing to come down to $100. This is a great price for you, and it's a fair deal for me. Let's close this deal and make it happen.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,6,
