"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or move directly to buying from John to save a considerable amount of money."
