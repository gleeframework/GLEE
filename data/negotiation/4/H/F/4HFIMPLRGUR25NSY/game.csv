"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective on the value. While $700,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible.  Could you consider a price point around $1,900,000?  I believe that reflects the product's true worth and opens room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on the price. I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is not feasible for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair offer considering I have other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand $800,000 is your current limit, I'm confident the product's true value is significantly higher.  To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects a considerable compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
