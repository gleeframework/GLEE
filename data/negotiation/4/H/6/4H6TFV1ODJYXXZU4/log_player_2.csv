"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great deal for you! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $90. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality item at a great price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $90 is still more than you'd like to pay.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate with her or go directly to John."
