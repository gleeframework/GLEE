Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do better than $800,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth considering.

Alice has met my best possible price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John."
