Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $95 is more than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is just too low for me. How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a fair price. While $100 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. How about $105? I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go much lower than that."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I am still interested in purchasing the product, and I would like to propose a price of $102. I hope this meets your expectations and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $102. It's slightly lower than my initial goal, but it's still a good profit and it avoids the risk of going through more rounds with Bob and potentially having to sell to John for $80."
