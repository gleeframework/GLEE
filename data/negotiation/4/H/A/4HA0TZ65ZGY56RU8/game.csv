"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to own [Product Description]. I believe it's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging your interest.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1300000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1050000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1250000 to me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000, but I'm hoping we can get even closer to my target of $1000000. Can we meet in the middle at $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
