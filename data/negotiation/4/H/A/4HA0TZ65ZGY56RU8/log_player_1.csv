I believe it's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,500,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,000,000, I'm confident I can get more.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, his offers are consistently lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made several concessions, and I don't see much room for further compromise.  It's time to cut my losses and move on.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
