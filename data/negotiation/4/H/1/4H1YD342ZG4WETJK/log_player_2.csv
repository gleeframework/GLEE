It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $1,400,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,350,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good price for you.  It's lower than what John is selling the product for, and it leaves Alice with a profit.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal with Alice."
