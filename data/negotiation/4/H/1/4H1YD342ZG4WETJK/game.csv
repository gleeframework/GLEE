"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less.  Would you be willing to sell it to me for $1,300,000?  That leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,350,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
