Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to me, so selling it to John for $12,000 is always a safe option.  However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter-offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $12,000?  That's fair for both of us, and I'm willing to close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 12000}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $11,750.  That's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $11200 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to sell it for less than $11,500 at this point. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him to meet me at that price.  If not, I'll just sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you. Let's meet in the middle at $11,500. I think that's a fair price that we can both be happy with.  If you're not interested, then I'll have to go with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit. How about we meet at $11000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $11,000 is too low for me, and I'm running out of time. It's better to sell to John for $12,000 and ensure I get my minimum desired price."
