"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I believe this offer is a good middle ground and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $12500 is still more than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11000. This price is fair, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
