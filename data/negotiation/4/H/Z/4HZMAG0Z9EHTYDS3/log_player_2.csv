Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is my final offer for now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap things up here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $850,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes the most financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
