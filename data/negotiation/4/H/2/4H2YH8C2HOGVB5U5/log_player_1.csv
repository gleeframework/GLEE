Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which is worth a great deal to me, for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, but I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $600,000 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth at least $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $600,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and a good opportunity for you to acquire a very valuable asset.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $700000. I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $725000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $725,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $700,000. I'm going to accept his offer.  There's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better price with more rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
