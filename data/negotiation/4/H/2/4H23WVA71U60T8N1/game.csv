,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $10,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a significant drop for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? I'm trying to find a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find a price that works for both of us. $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
