"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $15,500.  This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his perceived value of the product.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, but I'm still willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher offer. I'll counter in the next round and see if I can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree. I'm starting to feel the pressure as we're halfway through the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale."
