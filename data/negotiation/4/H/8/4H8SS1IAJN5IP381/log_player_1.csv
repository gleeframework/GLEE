{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John. 

Offering the product at $119 tempts Bob with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price while still netting you a profit."
