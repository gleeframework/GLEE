# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,210,000 is a bit too low for me.

Alice has consistently moved towards your desired price range, and $1,220,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer. Continuing to negotiate might not yield much further reduction, and risks pushing Alice away from the deal."
