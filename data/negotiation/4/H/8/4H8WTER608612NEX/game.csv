"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can work on the price a bit.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and the market demand. Let's meet in the middle and aim for a price of $1,225,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $1,210,000.  Do you think we can make this work?",1210000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,210,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll meet you at $1,220,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
