Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to proceed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! You've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: Analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a new price. Keep in mind John's offer of $12,000 as your fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to consider it if you're willing to come down to $8,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.
* **John's Offer Provides a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $12,000.  I'll need to find a balance between being firm and remaining open to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  Instead of simply rejecting Bob's offer, I'm providing a counter-offer with a reason behind it.  ""Splitting the difference""  presents it as a fair compromise.
* **Moving Towards My Target:**  $9,250 is a significant jump from Bob's offer and brings me closer to my desired price of $12,000.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  By making a counteroffer, I avoid immediately selling to John and keep the negotiation going.  There's still a possibility Bob might accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price. 
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. I'll keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $9,250 is closer to my range, I'm still not quite there.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair compromise that lets us both save a bit, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** $9,000 is only $3,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a Quick Deal:**  Bob is clearly willing to close the deal at this price.
* **Limited Upside:**  While I could potentially try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's unlikely I'll get much closer to my ideal price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $9,000. This is a good outcome considering his initial offer and the possibility of further negotiation."
