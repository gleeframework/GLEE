"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $900,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still give you a significant value for the product, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet you at $1,000,000. I propose $950,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I am willing to go up to $960,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of your item while staying within my budget constraints.",960000.0,Bob,6,
