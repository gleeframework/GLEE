``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is still higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $1,500,000, leaving room for you to make concessions if needed. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a deal that's closer to your desired price point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $900,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
