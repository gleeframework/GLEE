"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $85. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraint. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? This is a great deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $100 to you, and it still allows me to make a decent profit.",90.0,Alice,3,
