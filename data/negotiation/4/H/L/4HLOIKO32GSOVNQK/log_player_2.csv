Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraint. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? This is a great deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $100 to you, and it still allows me to make a decent profit.
