"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is friendly and focuses on the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message implies I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob feel comfortable making a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects my offer, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. If the negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $120.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob expressed interest and is willing to pay more than my minimum. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount, aiming for a middle ground.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution by offering a reasonable price that balances my desire for a higher profit with the need to reach an agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to evaluate his potential for further negotiation and decide whether to continue or move to John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $125.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $125 is just $5 away from my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant improvement from his previous offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are already in round 4, and it's important to keep in mind the limited number of rounds.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potential rejection.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer allows me to make a decent profit with less risk.  It's important to be realistic about the potential for further negotiation and ensure a sale within the remaining rounds."
