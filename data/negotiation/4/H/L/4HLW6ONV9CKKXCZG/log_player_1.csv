"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The price is lower than my minimum, giving me wiggle room to lower the price if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, creating a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have several rounds left, and there's a chance Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but it's risky to forgo the opportunity to potentially get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to recoup my investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and a great deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering the price, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Minimum threshold:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum price. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the price reduction.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The tone is still positive, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that balances my need to earn a decent profit with the potential for a quick sale. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the lower price and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time pressure:**  We are approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, and I need to ensure I get a price that meets my needs. 
* **John's offer:**  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum. I need to decide if the risk of continuing with Bob is worth the potential for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a compromise that is closer to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob. I will also need to carefully consider the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and the potential of selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your position. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price is a good compromise, and it gives you a substantial discount.  I believe this offer is fair and benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm further lowering the price to $1,450,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're now halfway through the rounds, and I need to find a solution that works for me while considering the time constraint. 
* **Positive and Collaborative:**  The message remains positive and collaborative, emphasizing that the offer benefits both parties. 
* **Finality:** I'm subtly hinting that this might be my final counteroffer, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get closer to my minimum price while remaining attractive to Bob. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be accepted, but I'll be ready to evaluate my options if Bob rejects it again. I'm also considering John's offer as a backup option, as the risk of continuing with Bob increases with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer is now significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time pressure:** We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and the risk of not finding a suitable price increases with each passing round. 
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:**  John offers a price that meets my minimum and provides a secure sale without any further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

The risk of continuing with Bob is too high at this point. His offer is too low, and the remaining rounds are not enough to significantly increase his offer. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures I don't lose time or risk further negotiation with Bob."
