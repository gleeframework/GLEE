Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's potential for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point.  While I agree it's a valuable product, $1,050,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. Let's try $1,025,000. This offer is a good compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,000,000 even? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
