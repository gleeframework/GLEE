"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I truly believe it's a fair price for this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
