**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $1,150,000 from Alice, saving $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Your goal is to save money.**  Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer guarantees a lower price than John's."
