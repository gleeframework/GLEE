"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. This aligns better with my current budget."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,075,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, we're still a significant amount above our ideal price and what John is offering.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $1,000,000.  To make this deal worthwhile for me, I'd need you to come down to $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Pressure:** We're introducing the presence of John's offer without explicitly saying we'll go with it. This creates time pressure for Alice to make a deal. 
* **Realism:** Our counteroffer is still a significant savings for us, but not so low that it's likely to completely offend Alice. 
* **Transparency (somewhat):** By mentioning a similar product, we're signaling that we have other options without revealing our absolute bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the fact you've found a comparable product.  However, I'm confident that mine offers unique advantages and a higher level of quality. To meet you halfway, I can offer it to you for $1,020,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Bluff:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by declaring this her ""final offer.""  It's designed to pressure us, but we still have leverage. 
* **Room for Movement:** While $1,020,000 is closer, it's still $20,000 above John's price. We've been firm and reasonable, so there's a chance for one more counter.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** We're in the later rounds. Rejecting this offer has some risk (Alice might walk away), but the potential reward of getting closer to $1,000,000 is worth the risk."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value your product brings.  I've been upfront about my budget constraints and what I'm willing to spend.  I can offer $985,000. This allows me to get a great product and still stay within my limits."",
""product_price"": 985000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:**  We're acknowledging her ""final offer"" but not backing down significantly. This shows we're serious but still willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $985,000 is a $35,000 drop from her last offer, showing significant movement on our part. It might be enticing enough for her to accept.
* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the 10-round limit. This counteroffer puts the ball firmly in Alice's court, increasing the pressure on her to make a decision."
