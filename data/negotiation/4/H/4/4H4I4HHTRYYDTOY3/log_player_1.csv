Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. This aligns better with my current budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $1,000,000.  To make this deal worthwhile for me, I'd need you to come down to $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aware of the product's value and is trying to negotiate a better deal. While his offer is getting closer to a million, I'm still willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can secure a price closer to my target."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value your product brings.  I've been upfront about my budget constraints and what I'm willing to spend.  I can offer $985,000. This allows me to get a great product and still stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $985,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Investment:**  We're already at round 6, and continued negotiation might yield minimal returns. Each round consumes time and energy that could be dedicated to other opportunities.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  John's offer provides a safety net. However, holding out for a slightly better deal from Bob while risking losing him entirely isn't worth the potential loss of $985,000.
* **Respectful Negotiation:** We've both engaged in a fair negotiation process.  Accepting shows Bob that we value his business and are willing to compromise.

Taking the $985,000 now ensures a significant return and allows us to move forward confidently."
