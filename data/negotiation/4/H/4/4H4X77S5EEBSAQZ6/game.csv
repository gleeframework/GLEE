"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you recognizing the value it holds for me.  However, I'm looking to secure it for a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot in between our numbers.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still looking to pay a bit less, though.  $1,150,000 feels like a good compromise.  It's closer to your price, but still a good deal for me.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. Let's try $1,225,000. This is a bit above your latest offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
