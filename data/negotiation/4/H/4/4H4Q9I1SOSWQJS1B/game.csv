"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",12000.0,Bob,4,
