Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price is lower than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob without losing too much.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason for the price (fairness) can help Bob feel more comfortable with the offer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation. By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I hope to maximize my profit while also leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worthwhile to continue negotiations or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation, doing so would mean losing a substantial amount of money. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation. This gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price. It also allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and whether it's worthwhile to continue negotiations or simply sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you taking the time to do your research. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate why my price is justified.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. By staying firm on my minimum acceptable price, I'm demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a deal that doesn't meet my needs. However, by offering a lower price than my initial offer, I'm also showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made a significant concession by dropping my price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price, maximizing my profits.  While it would be nice to negotiate a higher price with Bob, continuing the negotiation carries the risk of further concessions without achieving a satisfactory outcome.  

Selling to John is the most efficient way to ensure a successful transaction and achieve my financial goals."
