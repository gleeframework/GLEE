"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and to be fair, I won't accept anything less than $10,000.  How about we settle at $14,000? Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than buying from John for $15,000.  Even though the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, saving $1,000 is a good deal."
