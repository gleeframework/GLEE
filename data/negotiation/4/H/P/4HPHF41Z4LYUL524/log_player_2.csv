"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this extraordinary opportunity to you. The product we're discussing is truly exceptional and holds immense value, worth $15,000 to me. Given its quality and unique features, I believe it's also worth significantly more than what you've mentioned it's worth to you, which is $8,000. Considering the high demand and rarity of this product, I am offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This represents a substantial saving for you compared to the market value, while also ensuring a fair return for me. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if you have any concerns that we can address together.
