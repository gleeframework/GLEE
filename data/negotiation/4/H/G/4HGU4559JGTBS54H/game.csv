,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $1,500,000, especially considering its potential impact. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet in the middle again?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
