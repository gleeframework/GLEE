"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers substantial value, and to make a deal worthwhile for me, I'd need to see it closer to the $1,700,000 mark. How about we meet somewhere in the middle?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,700,000 is still  above my budget.  To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to the $1,000,000 mark. If you're able to come down significantly, I'm still interested, but otherwise, I might need to explore those alternatives.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I also need to ensure this deal makes financial sense for me.  How about we try this: $1,450,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident it's a fair price for this quality of product.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but $1,450,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers. Would you consider $1,225,000? This demonstrates my serious interest while staying within a reasonable range for me.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
