Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,600,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, your offer is quite far from where we'd need to be. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I see its potential for you. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and her price is coming down slowly. Even though it's her ""final offer,"" it's still significantly higher than John's offer. There's a real risk that continued negotiation with Alice won't close the gap enough, and you'll end up either overpaying or missing out.  John's offer is a safe bet at this point."
