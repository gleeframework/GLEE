"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value in the product, $10,750 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $9,750?  That would really help me make a decision.",9750.0,Bob,4,
