"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,075,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to close this deal, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a valuable asset. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
