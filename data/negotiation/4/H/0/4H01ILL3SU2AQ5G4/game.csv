"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to make sense for my budget. I could consider a price closer to  $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,400,000. This way, we can both benefit from the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I can do $1,100,000.  That's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can shake hands on this one.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
