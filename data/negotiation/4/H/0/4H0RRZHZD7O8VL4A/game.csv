"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way out of my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to pay something closer to $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially go up to $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counter offer. I understand where you're coming from.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  I'm willing to let it go to you for $11,000, but that's my absolute best offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
