"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,500.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
This is a terrible starting offer from Alice. The product is only worth $10,000 to me, and she's starting at $14,500. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way out of my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to pay something closer to $8,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's a negotiation tactic to begin significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a great deal.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out $8,000, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range.  Even if Alice doesn't accept, it makes the idea of a price closer to $10,000 seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While my max is $10,000, I don't want to reveal that just yet. Offering $8,000 leaves space to potentially meet in the middle if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still at her perceived value of $12,000. It's good to see some movement, but I'm not going over my $10,000 limit. I need to signal that I'm serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially go up to $9,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate by increasing my offer, but I'm doing it in a smaller increment ($1,000).
* **Staying Below Limit:** This keeps me well below my $10,000 limit while still putting some pressure on Alice to move further from her $12,000. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help me gauge how much more negotiating room there is. If she flat-out rejects $9,000, it might be time to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counter offer. I understand where you're coming from.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  I'm willing to let it go to you for $11,000, but that's my absolute best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Hitting the Limit:** Alice is playing hardball, and her ""best offer"" of $11,000 is still above my absolute limit.
* **No Guarantee:** Even if I counter at $10,000, there's no guarantee Alice will accept. She might be bluffing about the other buyer, or she might genuinely be willing to lose the sale.
* **John's a Sure Thing:** John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000. It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting stuck paying more than I'm willing, or worse, walking away with nothing. 

While I might have been able to squeeze a slightly better deal out of Alice, sometimes a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
