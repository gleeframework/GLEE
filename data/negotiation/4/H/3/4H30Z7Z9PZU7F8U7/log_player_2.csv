You can do better than $12,000.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $9,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise while still saving a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll reject and try to get closer to my ideal price with another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer to $10,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal."

Alice is not budging from her price. I've already made a few counteroffers, and it's clear she won't go any lower. At this point, it's better to buy from John for $15,000, as I know I can get the product for that price."
