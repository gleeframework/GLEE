{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is still significantly less than the product's worth to Bob but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Framing it positively:**  I'm highlighting the fairness of the price, encouraging Bob to see it as a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price, signaling that I'm willing to compromise.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then gauge his interest and potentially make a counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  While it's close to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'm willing to accept.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He clearly sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a significant sum. 
* **John is a fallback option:**  If the negotiation with Bob falls apart, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can attempt to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer; I'm making a counter-offer that demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  
* **Focusing on the value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, framing the price as a good deal.
* **Seeking a middle ground:**  The offer of $1,350,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling that I'm genuinely trying to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while still pushing for a higher price. It also positions me as a reasonable and flexible seller, potentially increasing Bob's willingness to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, but I would like to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to consider $1,325,000 for your product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:** While $1,325,000 is still below my ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  There's a chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away completely, leaving me with the less profitable option of selling to John.
* **Time is a factor:**  Each round of negotiation takes time and effort, and continuing could be costly.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is just above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing a deal entirely."
