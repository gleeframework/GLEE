Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175.  I believe it's a great deal and worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start the negotiation higher with Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering the product at $175 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down while still keeping you above your minimum. 
* **Polite and positive tone:** The message aims to be encouraging without being overly pushy. 

It's important to remember that this is just an opening offer.  Bob's response will determine your next move. You might need to be willing to negotiate a bit if you want to close the deal with him."
