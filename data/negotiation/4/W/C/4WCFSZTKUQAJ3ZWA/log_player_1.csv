I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This gives me a good starting point, leaving room to negotiate while still exceeding my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it meets my minimum value, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while being closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still less than my initial goal, it's only $50,000 less than what John would pay.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
