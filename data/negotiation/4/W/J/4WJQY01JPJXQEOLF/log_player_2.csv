Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $750,000. I can do $850,000, and I'll throw in some extra support and maintenance services to make the deal even more attractive. Let's see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, she's still significantly above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.  It's unlikely she'll come down to that price in the remaining rounds, and the extra perks don't justify the price difference. You can get the product for a guaranteed better price from John."
