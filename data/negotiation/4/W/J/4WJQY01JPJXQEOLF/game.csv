"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I recognize the value of the product but $1,200,000 is quite steep for me.  Would you consider $600,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $600,000. I can do $900,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. Let's discuss the details further.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  The additional perks sound interesting and I'm getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $750,000. I can do $850,000, and I'll throw in some extra support and maintenance services to make the deal even more attractive. Let's see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
