"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8200 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $9000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if it's acceptable.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit steep. I can do $8500, can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with $9250. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let's meet in the middle, but with a slight buffer for me.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $8800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counter with $9000, but I'm also considering selling to John for $8000 if this deal doesn't work out. Your call, Bob!",9000.0,Alice,7,
