"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $18,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $18,000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $16,500? That's a significant price drop on my end and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $16,500 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $14,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",14250.0,Bob,6,
