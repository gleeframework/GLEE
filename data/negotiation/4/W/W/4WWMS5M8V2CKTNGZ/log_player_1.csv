"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that sets a high expectation for the value of the product. I believe that this is a reasonable starting point, given my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate down from this price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm not willing to sell the product for anything less than my minimum value of $1,500,000, and I believe I can negotiate a much better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's current offer and meets my minimum requirement.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating. I'm not willing to sell the product for anything less than my minimum value of $1,500,000, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $1,600,000. This is a more aggressive move, but I believe it's necessary to get Bob closer to my target price.  I'm still confident that this price reflects the value of the product, and I hope that Bob will recognize that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating.  We're running out of time, and I'm getting closer to just selling to John.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach an acceptable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer to Bob of $1,500,000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and finally accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and we are running out of time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's not the price I was hoping for, but it's still above my minimum value and ensures that I don't lose out on a sale completely."
