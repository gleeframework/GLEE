"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a very fair offer considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's a range where both of us can benefit.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair deal.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This reflects its worth while still acknowledging your interest.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down, but we're still far apart. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can close the gap. The goal is to get the price as close to my desired $1,050,000 as possible."
