{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $12,000 for it. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because my minimum acceptable price is $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but my product is truly unique and worth more than $12,000. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $12,500. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the value you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a lower price, but still above my minimum,  while explaining my rationale. I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still believe we can come to an agreement closer to my initial offer. I would like to propose a price of $12,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While he's come closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $12,400."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue discussing this. I understand your desire to pay a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $12,400. I believe this price reflects the value of my product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 12400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. While $12,400 is a reasonable price, I would like to suggest a final offer of $12,300. This price respects the value of your product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is offering $12,300, which is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I've already rejected several offers and we're nearing the end of our rounds. Accepting this offer is the most sensible option to ensure a sale and maximize my profit."
