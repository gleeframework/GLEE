Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to work with him to find a mutually agreeable price.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for it just yet. I'd like to see if I can get a slightly higher price.  I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still leaving some room for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price and closer to what I initially wanted.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price makes this a good deal for me."
