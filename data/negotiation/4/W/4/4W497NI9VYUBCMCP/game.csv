"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product of significant value. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you. To be fair, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its potential value to me and your desired selling point.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm comfortable with my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.  I have other interested parties, but I believe this deal would be mutually beneficial.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our respective positions.  Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
