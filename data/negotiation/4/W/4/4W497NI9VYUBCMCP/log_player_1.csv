""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product of significant value. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you. To be fair, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its potential value to me and your desired selling point.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both his perceived value and my minimum. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?"",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm comfortable with my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is holding firm at $1,100,000. It seems he's aiming for a price closer to his initial offer. I need to show I'm willing to walk away if necessary to get him to move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.  I have other interested parties, but I believe this deal would be mutually beneficial."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our respective positions.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob has finally moved closer to my range, and while it's not the $1,200,000 I aimed for, $1,150,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to secure the deal now than risk him lowering his offer or walking away."
