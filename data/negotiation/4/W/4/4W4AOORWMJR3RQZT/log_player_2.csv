* **The goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting allows you to try and get closer to your target price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This still offers a significant value for you, and keeps the deal profitable for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.
