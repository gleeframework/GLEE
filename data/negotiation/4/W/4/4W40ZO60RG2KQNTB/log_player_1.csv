{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've expressed interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. This approach balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $112, which is a fair compromise.  This would be a great price for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than $107. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. At this point, I've already negotiated for a few rounds and it seems like Bob is unlikely to budge further.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
