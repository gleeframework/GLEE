"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit for this product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,5,
