Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to close the deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $9,850.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the 9th round, and Alice's offer is still $2,100 above my budget.  While we have made progress, it's unlikely we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with in the final round.  It's more prudent to accept John's offer at $8,000, as it saves me money and ensures a deal within my budget."
