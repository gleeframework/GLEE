"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still getting a good price for the product.  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, I think he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell for significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my ideal price but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price for both of us and accept. We're getting close to a deal, and I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob finally offered my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal.  It's a good outcome, considering I was willing to sell to John for the same amount."
