(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, there's no reason to accept immediately. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  There's no downside to rejecting and starting the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for negotiation. I'm confident Alice won't immediately accept, but it will give us a starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target price, but still not quite there. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get a lower price, as there's still room for improvement. I'm not ready to buy from John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want to get a better price than her last offer.  A $1,000 difference is a reasonable starting point for the next round of negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my target price, and I've already made significant progress in negotiations.  The risk of continuing to haggle and potentially losing the deal is higher than the small potential savings. I'm comfortable accepting this offer and securing the product."
