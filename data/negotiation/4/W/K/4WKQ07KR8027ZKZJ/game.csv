"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $9,500 to make this work.  Would you be willing to consider that?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $9,500. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'd rather go a bit lower. How about $8,800? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. If you can come up to $9,000, we can close this deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options. ",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $8,800 and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, but that's as high as I can go.",8800.0,Bob,8,
