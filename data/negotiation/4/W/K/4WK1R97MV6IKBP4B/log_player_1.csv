"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your target price. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression the product's value is even higher than Bob's estimate.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product and the potential for a deal can encourage Bob to engage seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, acknowledging that negotiation is expected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches his perceived value, which is significantly below your minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a better deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $200,000 demonstrates flexibility but maintains a firm stance on the product's high value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""true worth"" reiterates that your price isn't arbitrary and aims to anchor the negotiation closer to your target. 
* **Encouraging Movement:**  This counteroffer aims to prompt Bob to significantly increase his offer if he's serious about purchasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still constrained by my budget.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate further and try to secure a price closer to our target before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to move on the price is appreciated. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,650,000.  This is a significant concession and a very competitive price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  We are moving closer to John's offer, but we still have some room to maneuver. This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer and Bob's, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Strong Language:**  Using terms like ""significant concession"" and ""competitive price"" reinforces the value proposition even while lowering the price. 
* **Urgency:** By making a smaller concession this round, we signal that we're getting closer to our bottom line, which might encourage Bob to move more quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still hesitant at $1,650,000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,500,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now matched John's offer of $1,500,000. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation with Bob or waiting to sell to John. Accepting this offer guarantees you achieve your minimum acceptable price."
