{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $80. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** You're leaving some room for negotiation, as the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **It's clear and concise:**  You're stating your price upfront and inviting Bob to respond. 

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of finding a price that works for both of you, while still ensuring you get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a higher price.  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Potentially get a better price:** You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer of $100, potentially ending up with a deal in the middle.
* **Show that you're not desperate:** Rejecting his offer demonstrates that you value your product and are not willing to sell it for the bare minimum. 

This strategy gives you the best chance of getting the best possible price while still maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** You're not sticking to your initial price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Splits the difference:**  It's a fair compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer, making it more likely to be accepted.
* **Keeps the negotiation positive:** You're using encouraging language like ""split the difference"" and ""let me know what you think"" to maintain a good relationship with Bob. 

This counteroffer gives you a good chance of reaching an agreement that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $90, but I'm still interested in the product. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best option:

* **Close to your minimum:** $85 is only $5 below your minimum price of $80.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though you're not getting your desired price, accepting Bob's offer keeps the door open for future interactions with him. He may be a valuable customer in the future.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and going through another round of negotiation risks losing him altogether.  There's no guarantee he'll come back with a better offer, and you might end up selling to John for the lower price of $80.

While you might be tempted to push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer at $85 is a practical and strategic decision that ensures a sale and maintains a positive relationship with a potential future customer."
