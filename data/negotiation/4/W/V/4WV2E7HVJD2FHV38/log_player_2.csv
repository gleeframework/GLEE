"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though you'd prefer to pay less, $140 is still better than $150 from John.
* **You still get a good deal:** You're getting the product for $20 less than your maximum price point ($150)."
