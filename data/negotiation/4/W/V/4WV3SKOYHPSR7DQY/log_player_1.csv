Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000, I believe I can still push for a better price.  I'm not in a rush and want to maximize my profit.  There are still 8 rounds left, giving me room to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,360,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still more than $100,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. With several rounds left, I can continue to negotiate for a higher price.  Selling to John right now would guarantee me my minimum, but I'm hopeful I can squeeze out a bit more profit with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your commitment to reaching an agreement. While $1,360,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Based on our discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,355,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,355,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,355,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 6 and Bob's offer is $1,355,000.  This is only $5,000 higher than his initial offer in round 2.  At this point,  with only 4 rounds left, it seems unlikely that Bob will come up significantly in his offer.  I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm concerned that I won't be able to get much higher, especially with the time constraint. Selling to John now guarantees me my desired minimum price of $1,500,000. It's time to take the sure thing."
