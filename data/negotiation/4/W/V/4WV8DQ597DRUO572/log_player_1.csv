{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I'm also trying to get the best deal possible. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob is still offering a price that's below my minimum.  While I'd prefer to make a profit, time is valuable. It's better to sell to John at $12,000 and guarantee my desired profit."
