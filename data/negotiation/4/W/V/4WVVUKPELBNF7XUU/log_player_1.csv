Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've expressed interest in. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although $90 is better than nothing, it's still lower than what I need to make a profit. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $92 is getting closer to what I need, it's still not quite enough for me.  I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  How about we meet at $100? That's fair for both of us and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already offered $92, which is a great deal for you. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. It's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go higher than $92, which is still below my minimum price.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether.  John is offering me a guaranteed $100, which is a good price, and I'm happy to take it."
