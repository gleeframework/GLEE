Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer you the product for $122. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122

At this point, Alice is signaling she's nearing her minimum price. Accepting at $122 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of her walking away and forcing you to buy from John at $150."
