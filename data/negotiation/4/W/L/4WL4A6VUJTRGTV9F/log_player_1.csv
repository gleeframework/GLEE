Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so you have room to negotiate. 
* **It's a clear starting point:** This sets the tone for the negotiation and shows you're serious about selling.

Let me know what happens next!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  

Let's see if we can meet in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $105?  It's a compromise, and I think it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise, but you're still standing your ground.
* **Is closer to your minimum:** $105 is a better price for you than $90.
* **Is still attractive to Bob:** He values the product at $120, so $105 is still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is tempting, it's still below my minimum of $100. John is offering me a guaranteed $100, which is a safer and more reliable option. I'm going to sell to John."
