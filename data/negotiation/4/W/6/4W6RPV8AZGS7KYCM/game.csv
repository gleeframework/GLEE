"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $950,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
