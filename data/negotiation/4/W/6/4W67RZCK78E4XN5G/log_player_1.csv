Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, giving you a good profit margin.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is less than what Bob is willing to pay ($15,000), giving him an incentive to accept. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still securing a good price for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly below your initial offer of $12,000.  You want to see if you can get closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

You will make a counteroffer to Bob. Aim for a price between $9,000 and your initial $12,000.  You can offer $10,000 or $11,000.  Remember, it's a negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still allow me to make a decent profit and hopefully is within your range. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial $12,000, Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and still allows for a decent profit.  There is a chance Bob will reject my counteroffer and I could be left with only the $8,000 offer from John.  So, it is better to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
