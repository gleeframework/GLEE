The product is worth $120 to me, and Bob is offering $100. It's better to try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}

While $107 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to his price, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. There are 4 rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiating."
