"Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,18000.0
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds.",18000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $8,000.  If you can work with that, I'm ready to make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. That's below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product offers.",12000.0,Alice,5,,
