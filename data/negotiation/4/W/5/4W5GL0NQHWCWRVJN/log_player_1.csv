{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get more from Bob.  I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer to $12,500, which is getting closer to my desired price. While I could try to push for a little more, I'm comfortable accepting this offer.  It's a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
