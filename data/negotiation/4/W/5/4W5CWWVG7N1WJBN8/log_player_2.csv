{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially with a starting offer that's so much lower than your maximum. You have room to bargain and potentially save a lot of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to pay less than her asking price. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation in case she needs to compromise a bit."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved a bit closer to my initial counteroffer. While $7,500 is a decent price, I still believe I can get it lower.  I'll reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still below Alice's counteroffer.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to pay her full price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,200 is a good deal, I'm still within my budget and have room to negotiate. I'll reject and continue to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, showing I'm serious about buying and willing to move closer to Alice's price.  However, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  This is a small enough increase that it might be enough to make her reconsider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly in price, and we're only in round 7.  While I'd love to keep negotiating, accepting this offer means I'm saving $8,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and it's important to recognize when a good deal is on the table."
