"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $107.50 is still below my minimum. Let's compromise at $112.50. It's a fair price that meets us both halfway.",112.5,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $112.50. I'm willing to meet you at $109, but that's as low as I can go.",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $109 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $111, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to move on to another buyer.",111.0,Alice,7,
