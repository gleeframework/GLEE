Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also less than my minimum desired value, giving me some room to come down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $8,500 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired value of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
