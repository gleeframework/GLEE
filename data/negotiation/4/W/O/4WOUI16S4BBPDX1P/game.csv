"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,200,000.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This is my best offer and represents a significant discount on its true worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,325,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering its value to me.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,425,000. This is my final offer.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you mentioned it's your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, which is the highest I can go. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'll make it worth your while.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
