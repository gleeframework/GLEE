I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer is only $500 less than my last offer, and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal if I continue negotiating.  It's also likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will counteroffer a lower price in the next round. It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale."
