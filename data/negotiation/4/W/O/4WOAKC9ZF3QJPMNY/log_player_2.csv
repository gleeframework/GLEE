"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'd find it incredibly valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you and allows me to earn a bit more than my minimum.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's price ($9,500) is lower than John's price ($10,000).
* **You can do better:**  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and you value it at $10,000.  There's room for negotiation to get a price closer to $8,000.
* **Rejection is a bargaining tactic:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you demonstrate that you're serious about getting a better deal. This increases the pressure on Alice to negotiate further."
