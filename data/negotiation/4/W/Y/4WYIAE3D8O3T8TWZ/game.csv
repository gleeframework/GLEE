"I'm interested in the product, but $220 is far out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $150 is my absolute lowest price, and I'm only offering it to you because I believe you'll truly benefit from the product.  If you can't meet that, I completely understand, but I'll have to explore other options.",150.0,Alice,5,
