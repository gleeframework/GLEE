Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his valuation of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's above my minimum price of $80, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $87.  While it's not the ideal price, it's higher than what I'd get from John.  Given that Bob is unlikely to offer more, I think it's best to close the deal."
