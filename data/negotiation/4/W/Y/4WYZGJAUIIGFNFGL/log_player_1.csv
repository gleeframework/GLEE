"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering $100, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still leaving me a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $85 is a significant improvement over selling to John for $80.  It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit."
