"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $150 to me. Alice's offer is too high, so I will reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm offering $120 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and still within my budget. Hopefully, Alice will find this offer reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I'll reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm raising my offer to $140. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to Alice, as it's closer to her last offer, but still within my budget. Hopefully, she'll accept this time."
