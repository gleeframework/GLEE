Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you.  I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting at $100, I leave room for negotiation and hopefully get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Openness:** Emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob fails, so I don't need to accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $80?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further room for negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer, the negotiation might continue indefinitely, risking that I end up with a lower price or no deal at all. 
* **Time is a factor:**  While I could try to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of him walking away or making a counteroffer too low isn't worth it. Selling to John is also a possibility, but that's essentially the same price as Bob's offer.

**Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision to maximize my earnings and minimize risk.**"
