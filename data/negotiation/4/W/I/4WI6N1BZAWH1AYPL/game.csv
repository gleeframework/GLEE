I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.,900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. How about we meet at $950000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a deal closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $900000, Bob. I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, but I need to get closer to the value that this product holds for you. Let's try to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference: $912500.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I still need to get closer to the value that this product holds for you. I'm willing to go as low as $915000, but I think we can do better than that. Let's try to find a price that reflects the product's true worth.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $915000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $910000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as we're nearing the end of our negotiations. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $915000. I'm willing to make one final concession: I'll meet you at $912500, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",912500.0,Alice,9,
