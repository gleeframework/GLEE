"Alice,  $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is substantial.  How about we meet halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I'm still very interested in the product, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. ",14000.0,Bob,4,
