Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  This gives Bob incentive to accept, as he'd still be getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price if Bob counteroffers. 

By offering $115, you show you're willing to negotiate, but also set a clear price point that reflects the value of the product to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a higher price.  Here's why:

* **Potential for higher profit:** You can potentially earn more by getting closer to the $120 value Bob places on the product.
* **Risk mitigation:** If you sell to John immediately, you're guaranteed $100, but you're missing out on the chance to potentially earn more.
* **Setting a precedent:** Accepting Bob's first counteroffer could signal that you're willing to accept lower prices in the future.

**Next steps:**  You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $110 to $115. This will show you're willing to compromise while still trying to maximize your profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $108? It's a fair compromise, and it still gets you a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway, but it's still higher than his initial offer.
* **Attractive to Bob:** $108 is still significantly less than the $120 Bob is willing to pay, making it a good deal for him. 
* **Room for negotiation:** You can still adjust the price down slightly if needed.  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you can lower it to $105 or even $103 in subsequent rounds.

This counteroffer helps you maintain a position of strength while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $106 for the product? This would be the highest I could realistically offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is only $6 less than your minimum acceptable price, which is a good profit margin.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll walk away, and you'll be left with John's offer of $100. 
* **Time factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take longer, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.

**Conclusion:**  It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer ensures you get a decent profit and avoids potential delays or lost sales. You could always try to negotiate a higher price if Bob comes back with a counteroffer, but at this point, it's better to secure the deal and make the sale."
