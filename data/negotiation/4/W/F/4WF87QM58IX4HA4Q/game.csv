"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $8,200?  I think this is a fair compromise.",8200.0,Bob,4,
