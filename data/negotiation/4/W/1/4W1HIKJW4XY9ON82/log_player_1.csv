Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also keeping John's offer of $120 in mind as my ""walk-away"" price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still not quite there. How about $108?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $120. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement. John is a guaranteed sale at $120, so I'm going to take his offer and sell to him."
