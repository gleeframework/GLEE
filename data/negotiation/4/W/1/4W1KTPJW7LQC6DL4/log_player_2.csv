"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $115 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident in the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, he can likely still get it for a lower price.  Bob has shown that he's willing to pay a bit more, but he's also firm in wanting a better deal. A counteroffer gives him a chance to get the price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $107.50, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
