{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,200,000 outright leaves no room for negotiation and might seem suspicious. Starting slightly lower allows Bob to feel like he's getting a potential deal.
* **Safety Net:** We know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob rejects the offer. 

By offering the product at $1,150,000, we aim for a win-win: Bob gets the product for less than its worth to him, and we make a significant profit above our minimum."
