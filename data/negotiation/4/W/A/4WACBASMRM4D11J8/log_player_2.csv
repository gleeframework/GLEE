"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from her valuation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and potentially secure a better deal.  There's a chance she might come back with a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
