**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John is selling it for $1,000,000. This means accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $50,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob:**  Even though Alice is selling the product for a price higher than her valuation ($800,000), it's still within Bob's budget and he values it at $1,000,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob."
