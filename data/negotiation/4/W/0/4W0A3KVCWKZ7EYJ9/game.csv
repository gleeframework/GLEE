"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,125,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is a fair offer considering the unique value proposition this presents.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers, say $1,537,500?",1537500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  However, I can't accept anything less than $1,725,000 for this product.  It's a remarkably fair price considering the long-term value and potential this represents.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,725,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,631,250?  This is a fair offer and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",1631250.0,Bob,6,
