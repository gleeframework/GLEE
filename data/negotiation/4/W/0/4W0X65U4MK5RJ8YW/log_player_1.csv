Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $110 for your product.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $120? It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
