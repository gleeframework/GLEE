"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $130 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal on a fantastic product, and I think it's still fair for both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm happy to pay $100 for it.  Let's see if we can agree on that.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $100 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $105? That's the very lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in this product, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal.",102.5,Bob,6,
