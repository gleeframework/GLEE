{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a decent discount from my minimum value ($150). This is to incentivize Bob to accept, but also still leaves room for negotiation if he counters.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting. I'm highlighting the product's value for Bob and inviting him to consider the offer. 

By offering a price lower than my minimum, but still within a reasonable range, I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a smooth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $130 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and attempt to counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal on a fantastic product, and I think it's still fair for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing the price from Bob's offer to $110. This is still a significant discount from my minimum price, but it's closer to what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and reiterate that it's too low. I propose a counteroffer, highlighting its fairness and value for both of us. This approach focuses on finding a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm happy to pay $100 for it.  Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  If he rejects my final counteroffer, I'll sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $100 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $105? That's the very lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** This counteroffer is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, still above my minimum of $150.  It's a small increase from Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer and it reflects my costs. This adds urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

This counteroffer represents my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in this product, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $102.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiating, I've already made several concessions and am unwilling to go lower. 

Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a better profit than accepting Bob's offer. This is a more financially beneficial decision, and I'm confident that I'll receive my desired price with John."
