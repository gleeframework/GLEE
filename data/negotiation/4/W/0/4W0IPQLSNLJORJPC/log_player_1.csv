"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's lower than Bob's maximum value, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I am not willing to sell the product for less than that.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $13,000. This is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. It's also my final chance to sell to Bob before potentially having to sell to John for the same amount.  Accepting this offer ensures I get my desired minimum value."
