{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I can still get a better price than that, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not ready to sell for $78. It's getting closer, but I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $78 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $82, which is a fair compromise. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, it's taking a lot of rounds, and I'm running out of time. John is a sure thing, and it's better to get a guaranteed $80 than risk getting nothing from Bob."
