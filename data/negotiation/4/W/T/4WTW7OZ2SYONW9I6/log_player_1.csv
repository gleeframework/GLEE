Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the conversation going.
* **Backup Plan:** You're secure knowing John will purchase the product for your minimum acceptable price if Bob declines."
