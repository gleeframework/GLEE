,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,500 is unfortunately not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm trying to keep it closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  let's split the difference and go with $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
