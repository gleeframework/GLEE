"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However,  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a price closer to his maximum value while still being reasonable.  $90 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about $95?  I'm flexible and willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $95 is getting closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He can try to get closer to his target price of $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $95 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but  I can only go up to $92. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway by offering a price slightly higher than his previous offer. This shows that he is serious about buying the product and willing to compromise, while still remaining within his budget."
