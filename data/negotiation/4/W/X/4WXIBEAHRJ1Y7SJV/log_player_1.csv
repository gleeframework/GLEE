"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering the product at $100, which is a good starting point. This leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.
* **Building rapport:**  I'm starting the negotiation with a friendly message to establish a good relationship with Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By saying ""What do you think?"" I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However,  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about $95?  I'm flexible and willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by offering a counter-proposal. 
* **Staying close to my desired price:** $95 is a reasonable counter-offer. I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still keeping my profit margin.
* **Emphasizing flexibility:** By saying ""I'm flexible"" I'm encouraging Bob to see the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $95 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but  I can only go up to $92. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price range. While I could potentially try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's likely that further negotiation will just lead to a stalemate or a decision to sell to John.  It's better to secure a deal at this point, as I am within my profit margin and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
