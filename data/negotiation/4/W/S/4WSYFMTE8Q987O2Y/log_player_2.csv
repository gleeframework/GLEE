# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $5,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $7,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  It's unlikely she'll go below John's price at this rate. It's better to cut losses and go with the guaranteed $8,000 price from John."
