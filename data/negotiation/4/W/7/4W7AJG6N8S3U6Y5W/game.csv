,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a limited budget and $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it seriously.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could we potentially settle on $11,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still think $11,750 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $12,250. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it seriously.",12250.0,Alice,7,
