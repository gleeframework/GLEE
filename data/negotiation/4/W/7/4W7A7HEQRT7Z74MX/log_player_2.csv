"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $950,000. This is a significant markup and Bob should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he's still paying $50,000 more than the product is worth to him. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not quite there. $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $825,000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can work this out."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $825,000, which is $837,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, he's still paying more than the product is worth to him. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price. He's still got more rounds to make counteroffers and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $837,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're committed to $825,000, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $835,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. Here's why:

* **Time is Running Out:**  He has only three rounds left, and Alice's offers are still above his desired price point.
* **Limited Negotiating Room:** Alice has already made significant concessions. Continuing to negotiate could result in Alice walking away, and Bob wouldn't have time to find another seller. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his target price.

While he might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price from Alice, the risk of not securing the product outweighs the potential savings."
