"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your starting price is a little high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move down to $1,025,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,025,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $937,500?",937500.0,Bob,4,
