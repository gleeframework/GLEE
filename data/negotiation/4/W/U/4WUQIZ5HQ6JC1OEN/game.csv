"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a steal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This still leaves me room for profit while giving you a good price. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However,  $9,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let's find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,6,
