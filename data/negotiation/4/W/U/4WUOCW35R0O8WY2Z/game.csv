"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere, say around $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I can go down to $100, which is still fair considering the product's value. Let's try to make this deal work.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I'm reaching my limit. I can do $75, but that's the best I can offer.  If we can't agree, I may have to explore other options.",75.0,Bob,6,
