**Reasoning:**  Alice is stubbornly staying above our target price.  We need to show her we're serious about a lower price and willing to walk away."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I'm reaching my limit. I can do $75, but that's the best I can offer.  If we can't agree, I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. This offer is a final push to see if Alice will budge significantly. Mentioning ""other options"" reminds her that we have a backup plan."
