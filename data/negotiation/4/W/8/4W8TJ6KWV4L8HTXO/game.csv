"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $160, which is a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. My budget is firm at $120. If you're unable to go lower, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. $145 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",130.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $130, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I can do $140, which is my final concession. If you're willing to meet me there, we can make a deal.",140.0,Alice,7,,
