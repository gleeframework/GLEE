Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Provide Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the higher price, even without explicitly revealing its worth to you. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The open-ended question encourages Bob to engage in discussion, providing you with insights into his willingness to pay.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while still having the safety net of selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
