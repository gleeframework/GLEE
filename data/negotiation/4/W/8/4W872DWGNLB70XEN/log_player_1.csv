Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This price aligns with my budget and offers a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
