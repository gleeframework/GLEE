# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit high for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. I think you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle. How about $90? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $97.50?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.50}

**Reasoning:**  I'm proposing a price directly in the middle of our last offers. This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal but not willing to completely concede. If Alice rejects this, I'll likely switch to John in the next round to ensure I don't miss out."
