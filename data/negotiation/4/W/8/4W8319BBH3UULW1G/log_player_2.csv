"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially setting the price at $12,000. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is well above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, the product's value is truly significant.  How about we meet halfway at $10,000? This would be a fair deal considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate further. It's possible Alice might be willing to come down a bit more, and he doesn't want to miss out on potentially saving more money."
