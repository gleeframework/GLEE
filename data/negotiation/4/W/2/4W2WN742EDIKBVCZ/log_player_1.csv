"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment it offers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) establishes a strong initial position. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you believe in the product's high value. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's ""uniqueness"" and ""potential"" helps justify the high price, even if Bob is initially hesitant.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price makes it clear that you're willing to negotiate, fostering a sense of collaboration.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** A quick acceptance reveals Bob might value the product even higher than anticipated.
2. **Anchor the Negotiation:** Even with a counteroffer, the negotiation starts closer to your desired range. 
3. **Maintain Control:** You dictate the initial terms, setting the tone for the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, accepting immediately leaves potential profit on the table.  There's still room to negotiate, especially since you have ample rounds remaining and a guaranteed backup offer from John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer now, you signal that you believe the product is worth more. This keeps the door open for a counteroffer that could land you a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your offer, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, so I'm proposing  $1,450,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $150,000 from the initial offer shows flexibility and a willingness to make a deal. However, it's not a drastic drop, maintaining a strong position. 
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" reinforces your position that it's worth more than Bob's initial offer.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer lands roughly halfway between your previous offer and Bob's, signaling a desire to find common ground.

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage a Counteroffer:** The moderate decrease encourages Bob to engage further, potentially revealing his true valuation.
2. **Maintain Momentum:**  Keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to your desired range. 
3. **Avoid Stalemate:**  A smaller concession at this stage avoids creating an impasse too early in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered your minimum acceptable price twice. This suggests that $1,200,000 might be his top end, but there's still a chance he could be persuaded to go slightly higher.  You have plenty of rounds left and a guaranteed offer from John, so there's minimal risk in continuing the negotiation. 

Here's why rejecting is the best strategy:

* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  Rejecting again will reveal if Bob is truly unwilling to budge or if he's just trying to get the best possible deal.
* **Leveraging Time:** With rounds to spare, you can afford to be patient and see if Bob increases his offer under the pressure of potentially losing the deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:** The guaranteed offer from John provides a comfortable fallback position, allowing you to take calculated risks in the negotiation with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a number that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this work."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's consistent $1,200,000 offer and your previous $1,450,000 counteroffer. It signals a willingness to compromise but holds firm above your minimum.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:** Emphasizing that you're meeting ""in the middle"" and highlighting the ""significant discount"" positions the offer as fair and beneficial for both parties. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** While not explicit, phrasing this as a final attempt to ""make this work"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer.

This approach aims to:

1. **Elicit a Final Decision:** The offer's structure makes it difficult for Bob to counter without significantly increasing his offer.
2. **Avoid Appearing Desperate:**  You're still negotiating from a position of strength, having made a reasonable compromise. 
3. **Prepare for Alternatives:**  If Bob rejects this offer, it might be time to seriously consider John's offer to maximize your return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. Here's why:

* **Strong Position:** Bob has steadily increased his offer throughout the negotiation, indicating his genuine interest in the product.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could continue negotiating, the potential gains are shrinking. It's unlikely Bob will dramatically increase his offer at this stage.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away. Accepting his current offer guarantees a $50,000 profit over John's offer. 

By accepting now, you secure a respectable profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
