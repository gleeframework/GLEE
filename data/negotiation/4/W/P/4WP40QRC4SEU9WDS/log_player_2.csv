"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far beyond his budget, and he can get the same product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob's counteroffer is $10,000.  This is the maximum he's willing to pay and is a good starting point for negotiations. It's likely Alice will counter, but Bob is prepared to walk away if she won't come down to his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still significantly higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better price, and if not, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible.  He increases his offer to $12,000 which is halfway between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows he is serious about negotiating but is not willing to pay an exorbitant price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his price range, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further, but if he's not happy with the next offer, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price. He's offering $14,000, which is still below Alice's latest offer but shows he's willing to meet her halfway.  He's hoping that Alice will come down to his price or make a counter-offer close to it. If not, he'll consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He's only got a few rounds left before he has to buy from John. He should try one more counter-offer, but if Alice doesn't meet him halfway, he'll have to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

Bob is taking a risk by raising his offer to $15,000. He's hoping that Alice is willing to accept this price, as it's only $1,000 higher than his last offer. If she rejects it, he's left with no choice but to buy from John."
