Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is below Bob's perceived value but still leaves me with a decent profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for some negotiation and leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a raw deal.
* **Protecting My Minimum:** I'm comfortable with selling to John for $12,000, so I'm not going to lower my offer too far."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to earn more.
* **Potential for counteroffer:** I can counteroffer at a price higher than $12,000 but lower than $14,000 to see if we can reach a middle ground.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $12,000, I'm willing to risk further negotiation to potentially earn closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good price for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that is in the middle of my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000).
* **Showing Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it still leaves me with a decent profit and allows for potential further negotiation."
