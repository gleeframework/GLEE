{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,100,000 is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but still exceeds Bob's perceived value, giving me leverage. 
* **Message:**  The message is polite and straightforward, establishing a negotiation tone while also highlighting the potential value to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer gives me a strong starting point, allowing me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* If Bob rejects, I can lower my counteroffer gradually, but still aiming to maximize profit.
*  I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product is a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not desperate for a sale.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** I set a minimum acceptable price for a reason, and I'm not willing to compromise on that principle.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and there's room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a backup option with John, which gives me confidence to hold out for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired price, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to find a balance between being reasonable and maximizing my profits."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I appreciate Bob's continued willingness to negotiate, his offer of $990,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I've made significant concessions, but I'm not willing to compromise further on the value of my product.

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  I'm committed to my minimum acceptable price and won't settle for anything less. This price ensures I receive fair compensation for the product's value.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a reliable alternative buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.  This eliminates the risk of losing out on a significant profit.
