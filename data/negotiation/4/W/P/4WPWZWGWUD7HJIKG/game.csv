"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're considering.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my budget and the current market conditions, I am unable to meet you at $1,025,000. I would like to propose a price of $975,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while keeping within my financial limits.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $975,000 is closer, I can't accept anything less than $1,000,000 for this product.  This is my final offer - I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. Considering my budget and the alternatives available, I would like to propose a final price of $980,000 for the product. This offers a balance between fairness and staying within my financial constraints.",980000.0,Bob,6,
