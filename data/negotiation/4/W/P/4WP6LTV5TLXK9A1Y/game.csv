"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both something to work with. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $125 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $110. Would that work for you?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",117.5,Alice,5,
