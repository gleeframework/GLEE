Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell it for less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is my final offer, and I'm happy to sell it to John for $100 if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I appreciate his continued interest, $82 is still below my minimum price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm concerned that I'm running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time here. I'm willing to go down to $88, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to sell the product to John for $100."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $88 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is the price I was originally willing to pay for it from John. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low for me, and with only four rounds left, I'm not confident I can reach a deal with him that meets my minimum price point.  It's time to secure the $100 from John and move on."
