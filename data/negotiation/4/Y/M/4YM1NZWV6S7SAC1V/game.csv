"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $825,000 is still a bit out of my range, but I'm prepared to offer $800,000. It's a significant move on my part, and I'm confident this price is fair considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $820,000, which is $20,000 more than your last offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",820000.0,Alice,5,,
