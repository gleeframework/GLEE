(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still offers her a profit.  It also leaves some room for negotiation if she rejects the offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

This offer is a compromise.  It's higher than my previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest price.  It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, and hopefully, she'll be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above what I'm comfortable paying, even though it's a slight reduction from her previous offer.  I'm determined to try and get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing I'm willing to negotiate. This is a reasonable compromise between our last offers, and hopefully, Alice will be more inclined to accept. This price is still significantly lower than John's offer, so it's still in my best interest to continue negotiating with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are consistently getting closer to my maximum price. While there's still a chance she might accept a counteroffer, the risk of her continuing to increase the price is too high. Buying from John guarantees I get the product at a price within my budget.  Furthermore, with only three rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to secure a significantly lower price with Alice."
