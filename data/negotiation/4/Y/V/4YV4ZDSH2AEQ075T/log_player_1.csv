Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, it's unlikely he'll reach $800,000 quickly enough. I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the deal with John."
