Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 750000}
