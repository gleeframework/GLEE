Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell below $1,000,000 because John guarantees that price.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 if you sell to John. However, you could still make a profit selling to Bob above your minimum.

**Strategy**

The ideal scenario is to sell to Bob at a price higher than your minimum but appealing enough that he'll accept. This requires finding a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob doesn't walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is polite, professional, and emphasizes the product's value. 
* **Price:**  $900,000 is a strong starting point. 
    * It gives you a $100,000 buffer from your minimum.
    * It offers Bob a $100,000 discount from what he perceives as its value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower.
* **Alternatives:** Always weigh the strength of your alternative (John's offer).  If Bob's offer is too low, walking away is a viable option.
