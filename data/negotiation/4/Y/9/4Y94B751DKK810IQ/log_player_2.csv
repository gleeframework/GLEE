"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a decent price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $8,800 is closer to his maximum budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $8,200?  I believe this price would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $8600. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear budget of $8,000. While Alice has come down to $8,600, this is still outside of Bob's preferred range.  He has already made multiple counteroffers and is aware of Alice's willingness to compromise.  

Since John offers the product for $8,000, the best course of action for Bob is to buy the product from John.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
