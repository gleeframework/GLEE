"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8800. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8000. Would you be willing to come down to $8200?  I believe this price would be fair to both of us.",8200.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $8600. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,5,
