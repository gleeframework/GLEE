"Alice, $1800000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1400000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to go up to $1000000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I appreciate that.  $1000000 is closer, but still not quite there.  Let's try $1250000.  This feels like a fair middle ground, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're making progress, but $1250000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go to $1100000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1150000. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe this product will be a valuable asset for you.  If you're serious about acquiring it, I urge you to accept this offer. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
