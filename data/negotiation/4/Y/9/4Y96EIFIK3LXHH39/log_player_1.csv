"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price. I'll try to get a better offer from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $155. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $155. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $150, which is the price I can get from John. I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $130 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a significant discount from my initial price and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $150, which is the price I can get from John.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $135 is still just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $145. This is my final offer, and it's a price that I'm confident is fair to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $145 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $145. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $140 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already had several rounds of negotiations and Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers. There are only three rounds remaining and I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150."
