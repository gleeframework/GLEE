You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $950,000."

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, you can still try to negotiate further. It's likely you can get the price down closer to your ideal $850,000 mark."
