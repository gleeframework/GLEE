"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?  I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
