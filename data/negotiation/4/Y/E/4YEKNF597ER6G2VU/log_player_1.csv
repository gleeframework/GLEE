"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to entice Bob and make him consider the offer seriously.
* **Open-ended:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counter with a lower offer, keeping the negotiation going.

**Important Note:** I am aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.  However, by starting the negotiation with Bob, I am trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation process.
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds total, I have time to explore other options before resorting to selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal with you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Drop:**  Dropping to $1,100,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still leaves room for potential further negotiations.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate my commitment to reaching a deal with Bob, reinforcing the value of the product.

**Important Note:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still maintains a significant margin for profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $800,000 offer, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. There's little room for negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:**  I still have several rounds left, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring a reasonable profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in Round 5, aiming to find a compromise point closer to my minimum price. However, I will keep John's offer in mind as a backup, prepared to close the deal with him if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $950,000? This price acknowledges your budget constraints while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's unique qualities.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer represents a significant compromise, acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while still ensuring a decent profit for me. 
* **Focusing on Value:**  I emphasize the ""unique qualities"" of the product to remind Bob of its value.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  My message uses phrasing like ""bridge the gap"" to convey a sense of compromise and move towards a potential agreement.

**Important Note:** While John's offer is still a viable option, I believe this counteroffer gives me a strong chance of securing a deal with Bob while still earning a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further, but $950000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000, which is a significant step for me.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can close the gap at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with the increase, Bob's offer is still $150,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time is still on my side:**  I have four rounds left, giving me time to explore further options before resorting to selling to John.
* **Room for negotiation:** There is still room to try and close the gap with Bob.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in Round 7, aiming to find a compromise point that is closer to my minimum price, but still allows me to maintain a significant profit. I will keep John's offer in mind as a backup, prepared to close the deal with him if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $850,000 still leaves a significant gap.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $900,000? This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** This offer shows continued flexibility and a willingness to find a solution, while still keeping my profit margins above my minimum.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  My message highlights the ""mutually beneficial outcome"" to make Bob feel like this price is a win-win scenario.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I use language like ""make this happen"" to convey a sense of urgency and push Bob towards accepting the deal. 

**Important Note:** With only three rounds left, I am getting closer to John's offer, but I still believe there is a chance to secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $875000. This is a fair compromise, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer, while higher, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I cannot accept it.
* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds left, the pressure is mounting, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I can still secure a $1,000,000 sale with John if I don't reach an agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in Round 9, aiming to find a middle ground closer to my minimum price. However, I will keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to close the deal with him if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $875,000 is still significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $925,000?  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to finalize this deal. It's the last offer I can make, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my last offer, emphasizing the urgency to reach a deal and leaving no room for further negotiations.
* **Meeting Halfway (again):** I am still meeting Bob halfway, offering a price closer to his offer but still higher than his last proposal.
* **Urgency:**  My message emphasizes the finality of the offer and the need to finalize the deal, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** This offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm prepared to accept John's offer if Bob rejects it.  The next round is the last chance to secure a deal with Bob before having to move on to my backup plan."
