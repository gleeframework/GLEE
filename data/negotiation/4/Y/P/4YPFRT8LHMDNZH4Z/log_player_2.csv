"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price. Alice's initial offer is close to her minimum, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows us to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm very interested in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000, which is still a great deal considering the value this product brings. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point.  I want to keep trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to see some movement from your end. I can offer it to you for $1,180,000, which is a compromise on my end. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point.  At $1,180,000, we are close enough to a deal that it makes sense to accept, rather than risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  If I continue negotiating, I might get a slightly lower price, but there's also a chance that Alice will walk away or that we'll run out of rounds.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product within my budget."
