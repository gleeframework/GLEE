"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair deal and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000 either. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it holds for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it holds for you.

It's clear that Alice is not going to go below $12,000.  It's better to secure the known deal with John than to continue haggling with Alice and potentially end up with a worse outcome."
