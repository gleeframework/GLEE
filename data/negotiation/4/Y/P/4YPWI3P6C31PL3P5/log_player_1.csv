Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product without revealing too much information. 

This approach allows me to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
*  Start negotiations from a strong position. 
*  Have a clear fallback option with John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than my minimum of $10,000, I'm not comfortable accepting it yet. I believe there's room for a higher price, especially considering Bob's initial interest.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can attempt to get closer to my desired price.
* **See if Bob's willing to compromise:** He might be willing to increase his offer slightly.

If negotiations don't work out, I can always go with the $10,000 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $12,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $15,000 to $13,500 to show flexibility.
* **Reasoning:** I justify the price by highlighting the product's value.
* **Keep the door open:** I avoid using phrases like ""take it or leave it"" to keep negotiations open.

This counteroffer aims to:

*  Find a middle ground with Bob.
*  Show that I'm serious about a deal but still value the product. 
*  Encourage Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12800. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering the value you've mentioned. Let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for $10,000 from John is too high.

By accepting Bob's offer:

* **I secure a sale:**  A deal is better than no deal.
* **I minimize the potential loss:**  $12,800 is significantly more than $10,000.

This decision balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
