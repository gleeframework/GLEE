"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I would get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than the value this product will bring you. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while remaining within your budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000.
