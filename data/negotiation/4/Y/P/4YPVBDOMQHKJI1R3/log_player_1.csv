Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I would get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?

I'll reject Bob's offer for $1,200,000.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."

I'll accept Bob's offer for $1,250,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and I'm confident I can still make a good profit.  It's important to note that this is a situation where there is a good chance that Bob will reject my next offer, and I will end up selling the product to John. It is a risk that is worth taking, because it could result in a higher profit."
