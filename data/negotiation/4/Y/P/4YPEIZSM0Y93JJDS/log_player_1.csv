Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel more inclined to buy.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm letting Bob know I'm willing to negotiate, which might make him more likely to counteroffer. 

This strategy gives me a chance to get a higher price while keeping the door open for negotiation. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll have to see how his counteroffer looks and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.  I'll always keep John's $120 offer in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I'm confident I can negotiate a better price than $100, so rejecting his offer gives me the chance to make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'll always keep John's $120 offer in mind as my fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $150 to $130. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price ($130 is fair for both of us) and highlighting the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive relationship with Bob. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $130 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer of $115 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still a good deal for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely or continue to offer lower prices. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.

Selling to Bob at $115 is a reasonable compromise that allows me to sell the product and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation. I'm happy to take this deal and move on."
