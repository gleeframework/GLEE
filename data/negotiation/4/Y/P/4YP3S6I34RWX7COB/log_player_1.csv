Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135.  I believe it offers great value, even at that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $120. This is our baseline.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It allows us to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding our minimum price.
* **""Special Price"" Framing:**  By framing the offer as a ""special price,"" we aim to create a sense of exclusivity and value, potentially enticing Bob to accept even if it's slightly above his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes a one-shot interaction. If there were multiple rounds of negotiation, the approach would change.
*  We don't want to price the offer too high, as it might lead Bob to immediately reject it without a counter-offer."
