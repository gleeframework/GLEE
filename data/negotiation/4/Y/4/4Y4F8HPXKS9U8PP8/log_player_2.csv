"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm ready to move quickly if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  I have several rounds left to see if we can find a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to go up to $10,500, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,750. This is my final offer for now. Let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and I only have 5 rounds left. It's getting close to my limit, and I'm starting to feel like I'm unlikely to get it for my target price.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John, I'm going to take the safe option and buy from him."
