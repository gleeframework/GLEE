{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring a profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We know John will buy the product for $150, so there's no pressure to go below that price.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and ensuring a successful sale."
