Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 9500} 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than my desired price.  I'll try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe $9,000 is a fair price given the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, Bob's offer is getting too close to John's offer.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiations. I'll sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on a sale."
