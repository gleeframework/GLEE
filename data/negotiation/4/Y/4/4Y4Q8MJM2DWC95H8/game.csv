"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that you've expressed interest in before, and I'm confident it could generate significant returns for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire this asset at a price well below its true market value. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm sure you'll agree it's a wise one. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
