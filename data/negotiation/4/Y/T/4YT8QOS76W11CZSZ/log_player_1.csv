Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's valuation.
* **Creating a sense of value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The message invites Bob's thoughts, suggesting a willingness to negotiate if needed.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit by:

1. **Potentially securing a price higher than $15,000:** Bob might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation, especially if he perceives the product as unique or urgently needed. 
2. **Having a fallback option:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can sell to John for her minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation. If she knew it was $10,000, a different approach would be more suitable."
