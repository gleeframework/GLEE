"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential ROI for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering allows for a better price.**  There's potential to get the price down closer to Alice's value, saving a significant amount of money."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.**  While it's a decrease from her initial offer, it's still above the product's worth to her. There's still room for negotiation.
