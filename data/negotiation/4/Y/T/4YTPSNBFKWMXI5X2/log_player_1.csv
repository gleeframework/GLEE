I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident that Bob will be motivated to negotiate as the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,500 is still a decent profit, I'm confident I can get a better price. Bob is clearly motivated to buy, and I'm willing to negotiate further to secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $13,500.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm betting that Bob will see this as a fair price, considering his willingness to pay $12,500 and my previous offer of $14,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance he might not budge further, and I'm not confident I could get a higher price. Selling to John for $10,000 is also a possibility, but I'd rather secure the higher profit with Bob."
