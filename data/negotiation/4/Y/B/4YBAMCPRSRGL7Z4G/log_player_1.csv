"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price without pushing him away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $105 and secure a sale, I believe I can get closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to pay $110 for the product? It's a great deal for something that will benefit you greatly."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm raising the price slightly, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm also trying to emphasize the value of the product to Bob,  increasing his incentive to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my previous counteroffer. How about $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe there's more room for negotiation and I'm determined to get closer to my goal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again? $108.75 is a fair price that's in the middle ground.  It's a great deal for a product that will significantly benefit your business."", ""product_price"": 108.75}
```

I'm trying to keep the negotiations moving forward. I've again used a compromise tactic, hoping that Bob is willing to meet me halfway. I'm also reminding him of the potential benefits of the product to increase his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $105, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to his perceived value of the product,  I'm still not satisfied with the price. It's tempting to take $105, but I want to see if I can push for a better price in the remaining rounds. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $105, but that's unfortunately below my minimum.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get great value from this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm taking a slightly different approach this time. I'm acknowledging Bob's position, but I'm not budging too much further. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and the value of the product to him. I'm hoping that with only a few rounds remaining, he'll be more likely to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to pay $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which is $107.50. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob has shown he's not willing to budge from his price, and I'm not confident I can get him to agree to a price closer to my minimum.  Selling to John ensures I reach my minimum and avoid further negotiation."
