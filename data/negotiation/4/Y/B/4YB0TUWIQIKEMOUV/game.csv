,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living from this sale. I can meet you halfway between $9000 and $12000, which is $10500. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to go down to that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I can offer you a slight discount from $10500 to $10200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but I'd like to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet at $10000? That's the lowest I can go, and it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but I really think that's the most I can afford. Can you consider that price?",9800.0,Bob,8,
