Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $12,000 falls significantly short of what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $18,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach our minimum of $15,000. We have a guaranteed offer from John for our minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
