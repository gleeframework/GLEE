""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We know John provides a ""safety net"" at $1,200,000. Therefore, Alice's goal is to see if she can get more than that from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at Bob's valuation of $800,000 would be too low.  Offering slightly below Alice's minimum ($1,200,000)  leaves room for negotiation but sets a strong anchor. By starting at $1,150,000, there's potential for Bob to counter-offer, and Alice can still potentially secure a price higher than John's offer.
* **Open Communication:**  The message encourages further discussion, giving Alice flexibility to negotiate based on Bob's response."
