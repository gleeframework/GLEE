Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. To be fair, this product offers significant long-term value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.
