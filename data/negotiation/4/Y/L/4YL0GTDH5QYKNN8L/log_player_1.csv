{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High Anchor:** This opening offer acts as a strong anchor point, making a final price closer to your desired outcome more likely.
* **Alternative Secured:** You have a fallback option with John at $1,200,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an unreasonably low offer from Bob."
