"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to offer $950,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still above my target. Considering the value to both of us, I believe $1,000,000 is a fair compromise. This price allows for a good deal for both parties.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
