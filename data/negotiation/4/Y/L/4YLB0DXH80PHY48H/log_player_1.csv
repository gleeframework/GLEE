"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""immense value and potential"" avoids revealing specifics about your minimum while justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point for negotiations"" clearly indicates your willingness to discuss the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for showcasing the product. While I recognize its value, your starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and your initial offer. While it's clear there's a gap to bridge, accepting such a low offer in Round 2 would be a weak negotiating position. It's worth seeing if you can bring him closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and long-term potential."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge but Stand Firm:**  We acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate that it's far too low. 
* **Strategic Concession:** A substantial decrease from $2,250,000 to $1,900,000 signals willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well above both your floor and Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  We continue to emphasize the product's value, subtly shifting the focus away from the price reduction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  Let me know if this works for you, as it's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Bob is using the classic ""final offer"" tactic to pressure you. Don't let it sway you. You still have negotiating room and a guaranteed offer from John.
* **Below Your Minimum:**  $1,000,000 is your absolute lowest acceptable price. Accepting now would mean settling for no profit.
* **Maintain Credibility:** Quickly accepting after stating your previous price was already a compromise could make you appear less credible in future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, that final jump is substantial for me. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. If you're willing to meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Competition (John):** Letting Bob know about John increases the perceived value of the product and creates a sense of urgency. 
* **Transparency and Justification:** Explaining your position (another buyer at a higher price) justifies your counteroffer without completely revealing your hand. 
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is a strong but fair compromise. It's a final attempt to secure a deal with Bob while staying above your absolute minimum.
* **Clear Ultimatum:** The ""meet me at..."" phrasing implies this is your best offer, prompting Bob to make a decision."
