"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I'm still looking to keep the price within $800,000. Could you consider $1,400,000 as a fair compromise?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. $1,400,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000, but I won't go any lower. This is a final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
