Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is below Bob's maximum value of $15,000, so there's potential for both of you to find a price you're happy with. 
* **It's a strong opening:** By offering a price that is relatively close to your desired outcome, you show that you're serious about making a deal."
