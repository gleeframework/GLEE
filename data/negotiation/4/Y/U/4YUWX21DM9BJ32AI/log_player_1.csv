"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $8,000, this price is likely within his range of consideration. This offer gives me a good starting point and allows me to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. I have 8 rounds left and a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so I have some leeway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's offer of $9,000. It's also closer to the middle ground between our valuations, making it a more appealing proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price point, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. I have 6 rounds left and a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer of $9,500.  It's getting closer to the middle ground and might be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not going to give up the negotiation completely.  I still have 5 rounds left and a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is getting closer to my desired price point, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. I have 4 rounds left and a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer. I still have time to see if I can get Bob to agree to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counter with $9,900. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it still keeps the price above Bob's last offer of $9,750. I'm trying to signal that I'm flexible and willing to meet halfway, but I'm also trying to squeeze out the last bit of value possible before I have to resort to selling to John.  I have 3 rounds left and a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so I'm not in a hurry to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are in round 8, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While $9,800 is better than his previous offer, I have only two rounds left.  There is a high chance Bob won't budge further, and I risk ending up with a lower price than what John is offering. Therefore, it's more prudent to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
