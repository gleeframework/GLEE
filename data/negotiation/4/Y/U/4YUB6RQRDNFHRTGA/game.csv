"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that the product is worth a bit more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price considering the value it can bring to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $110 is still a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $105?  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $115? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you, and it's still a good profit for me.",115.0,Alice,5,
