"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can likely get it for less.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that the product is worth a bit more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price considering the value it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to accept $80, so there's still a range where you can both benefit. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get the product for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $110 is still a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $105?  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $115? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you, and it's still a good profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a bit higher than you'd prefer, it's still within your budget of $120.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it's risky.  If Alice rejects your next counteroffer, you'll be forced to buy from John for $120.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now rather than risk paying more."
