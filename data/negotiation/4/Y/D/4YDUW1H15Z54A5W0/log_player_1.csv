"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $850,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also working for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This price still gives you a significant return on your investment. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
