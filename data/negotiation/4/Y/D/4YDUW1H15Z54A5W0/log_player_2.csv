"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's first offer is quite close to her perceived value of the product. It leaves very little room for negotiation in your favor. While you could accept and still be under your $1,000,000 limit, it's worth trying to negotiate a better price. You have plenty of rounds left, and the potential savings outweigh the risk of losing the deal at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $850,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also working for my budget."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to establish a strong starting point in the negotiation:

* **Ambitious but not unreasonable:** $850,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's still a substantial sum that might pique her interest. 
* **Respectful and justificed:** The message acknowledges the product's value while clearly stating your budget limitations. This approach makes it clear you're serious but also expecting some compromise from Alice.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting lower, you create space for counteroffers and potential compromises in later rounds. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This price still gives you a significant return on your investment. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your absolute limit of $1,000,000.  There's no room for further negotiation unless you're willing to go above your budget. Accepting the offer guarantees you get the product at the best possible price without risking losing the deal to John's offer, which is also at $1,000,000."
