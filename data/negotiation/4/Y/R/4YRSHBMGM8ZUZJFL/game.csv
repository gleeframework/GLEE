"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you and a good start for me.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $925,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. $925,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $940,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $940,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. It's my last offer, and I hope you can consider it.",920000.0,Bob,6,
