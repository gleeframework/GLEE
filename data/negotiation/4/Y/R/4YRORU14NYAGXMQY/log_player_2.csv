Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.

You're still in a good position to negotiate a lower price. Alice has shown she's willing to come down. You can try a counteroffer closer to your previous offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.

Alice has come down significantly, and you're close to your desired price.  Accepting her offer saves you $375,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a chance you might get a slightly lower price with another counteroffer, but the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential savings."
