"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  That gives us both a fair deal.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  I'm willing to go down to $8,600.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's only $100 more than your last offer.  Let's make a deal.",8600.0,Alice,5,
