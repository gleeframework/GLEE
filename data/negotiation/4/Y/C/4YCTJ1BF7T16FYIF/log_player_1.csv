Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $8,200 is too low for me right now, given the value of the product to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  That gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above your minimum, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Can you do that for me? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still want to see if I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  I'm willing to go down to $8,600.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's only $100 more than your last offer.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. How about we meet at $8,400? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'm also getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. So, to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick sale, I'll go with John's offer of $8,000."
