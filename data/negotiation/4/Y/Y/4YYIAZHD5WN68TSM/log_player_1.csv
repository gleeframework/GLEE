Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price considering the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,075,000,  which is a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated. We're still significantly above John's offer, and with 6 rounds remaining, there's room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's close this gap. How about $1,090,000? This recognizes the product's value while hopefully addressing your budget concerns."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm happy to go up to $1,080,000, which seems like a fair meeting point. Let's finalise this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, and we've reached $1,080,000.  This is a strong profit, significantly exceeding John's offer.  While we might squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the risk of Bob backing out outweighs the potential gain at this point."
