"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm suggesting a price of $95 for this product. I understand it's worth $80 to you, but I hope you'll consider the additional value we're providing. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, $95 is still more than your $80 limit and more expensive than buying from John. You can do better by rejecting this offer and sticking with your alternative option."
