{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  This price reflects the potential it holds, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Fair Starting Point:**  I'm framing the price as a ""fair starting point"" to make it seem like a reasonable offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've secured a great deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **Negotiation Stalls:**  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll switch to John and sell for $1,000,000 to secure at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my desired price. While $900,000 is still above my minimum value, it's a considerable drop from my initial offer. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for this price just yet.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000.  I'll consider factors like Bob's perceived value of the product and his willingness to negotiate before making a decision."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is below my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a final decision."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but not settling for Bob's significantly lower price.
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  I'm framing the offer as a way to reach a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" appealing to Bob's desire for a win-win scenario.
* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm explicitly acknowledging the gap between our offers and presenting my counteroffer as a way to close that gap. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Stalls:** If we can't reach an agreement, I'll switch to John and sell for $1,000,000 to ensure I receive at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Bob walking away entirely.  

* **Close to Minimum:** The offer is only $50,000 above my minimum, making it a reasonable deal.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower offer from Bob. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting this offer allows me to move on and potentially pursue other opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction."
