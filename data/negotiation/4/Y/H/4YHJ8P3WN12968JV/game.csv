"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I could easily buy it from John for $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering my value for the product and the fact that I could easily buy it from John for $8,000. Let's make a deal at this price and avoid further back and forth.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,5,
