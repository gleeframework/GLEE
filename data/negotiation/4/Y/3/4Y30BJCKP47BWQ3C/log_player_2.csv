"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above Alice's minimum value. There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. Considering your offer of $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but also takes into account your budget constraints. What do you think?
