"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. There's still room to bargain, and Bob has the option to walk away and buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiation doesn't go in his favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $11,000 is better than Alice's original asking price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $10,000.  He can still try to negotiate further or walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $11,200. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down in price, she's still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get Alice down to a price that's acceptable to Bob.  Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's target price, it's more efficient for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
