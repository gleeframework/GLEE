Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}

While $105 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
