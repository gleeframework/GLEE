"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** $400,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% reduction from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates my seriousness in getting a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is a good compromise, bridging the gap between our previous offers.  Accepting this offer secures a good price while preventing further rounds of negotiation and the risk of Alice walking away."
