"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is above her valuation, it's still significantly less than your maximum price of $1,200,000 and the price John offers. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
