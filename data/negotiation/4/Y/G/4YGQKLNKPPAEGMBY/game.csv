"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,700 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",8900.0,Alice,5,
