"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $13,500 is better than John's price of $15,000, but it's still more than the product is worth to Bob ($15,000).  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or get a better deal from another seller."
