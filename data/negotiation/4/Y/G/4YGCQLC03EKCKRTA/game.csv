"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a significant amount of value for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still below my minimum. Let's aim for $1,025,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
