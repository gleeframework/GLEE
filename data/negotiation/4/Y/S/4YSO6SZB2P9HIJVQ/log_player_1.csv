We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000.  However, it doesn't seem likely I can get a much higher price from Bob. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and possible stalemate, I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000."
