"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum threshold. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for some wiggle room for counteroffers, and allows me to assess Bob's interest level. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While I am open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get a better price.** There's still potential for Bob to come closer to my desired price range.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first.**  John's offer provides a safety net, but I'm hoping for a better outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to Bob's price:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Emphasizing the ""significant value"" for Bob at this price point reinforces the potential benefit to him.
* **Staying firm on principles:** I'm not willing to drastically reduce my price, but I'm open to finding a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While he's coming closer, I need to hold out for a better deal.
* **We have six rounds left.** This gives me ample time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Selling to John remains a viable option, but I'm not ready to abandon negotiations just yet.** I'm confident I can push for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $10,200? That's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we want. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** This counteroffer represents a smaller increase than the previous round, demonstrating flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting compromise:** Emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" reinforces the win-win potential of this offer.
* **Setting a deadline:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by asking Bob to respond quickly. This might encourage him to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000 at this point. 
* **We have four rounds left.** I still have time to continue negotiating with Bob and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John remains a viable option, but I'm determined to see if I can reach a better deal with Bob.**  He's shown a willingness to compromise, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is still a bit too low. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a final agreement.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, bringing the price down closer to Bob's desired range. However, it still remains above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both of us, suggesting a win-win scenario. 
* **Urgency and Closing:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by mentioning ""closing this deal,"" suggesting that this is a final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now in round 8, leaving only two rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  He's not willing to budge much further, and I'm unlikely to get a significantly higher price in the remaining rounds.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed $15,000.**  This is a significantly better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiating with Bob further risks losing time and potentially ending up with a worse outcome.**  Selling to John is the safest and most financially beneficial option at this point."
