"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11000 is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10500 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10750. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,
