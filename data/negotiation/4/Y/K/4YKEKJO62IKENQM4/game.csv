"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to compromise further and offer $13,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows me to acquire the product within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",13750.0,Alice,5,
