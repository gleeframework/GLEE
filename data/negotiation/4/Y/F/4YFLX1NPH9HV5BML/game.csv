"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  My initial price is $900000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for us to negotiate a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000,  which still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. This represents a significant compromise on my side, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let's continue to work towards a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $825000, which is closer to my budget and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find a final price that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
