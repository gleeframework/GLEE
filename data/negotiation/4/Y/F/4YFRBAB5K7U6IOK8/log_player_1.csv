Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin.  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he might be willing to negotiate up to my price.  I'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my target, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,750,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a significant profit. It's a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will accept."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and a good deal considering the remaining rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and ending up with John's lower offer."
