Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to show my commitment to closing this deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of Alice walking away or the negotiations dragging on. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, saving him a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Furthermore, with only 5 rounds left, Bob is running out of time to negotiate a better price."
