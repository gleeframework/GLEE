Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and represents a great deal for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as much money as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at that price is pointless as Alice would lose money. Offering it close to $1,200,000 risks Bob rejecting it outright. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** The price of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice if Bob accepts. It's a strong opening position that signals value while enticing Bob with a potential bargain."
