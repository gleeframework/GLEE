Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my potential profit. I believe Bob might be willing to pay more, as he's a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to meet him halfway and still achieve a better outcome than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price.  While I could counteroffer again, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value."
