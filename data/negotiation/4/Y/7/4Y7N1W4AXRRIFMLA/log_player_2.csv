"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $18,000. It's a great opportunity to own a valuable item that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still far above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can bring the price down further before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still too much for me.  I'm happy to go to $10,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price considering it's a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for me.  While she's showing a willingness to negotiate, we're not close enough to a price I'm comfortable with. At this point, it's more efficient for me to just buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid any further negotiation."
