"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still too much for me.  I'm happy to go to $10,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price considering it's a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,,
