{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the fairness of the price, hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

This offer starts the negotiation with a reasonable price that leaves room for bargaining. If Bob rejects, I can make counteroffers based on his responses, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also far below the initial offer I made, suggesting he's trying to lowball me.  I need to counter his offer to try and secure a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $950,000, which is still well above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value proposition to Bob, framing my offer as a fair compromise to encourage him to consider it.  I'm also trying to build rapport by focusing on finding ""common ground.""

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go below a certain price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I need to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any point. This gives me a strong bargaining position and allows me to see if I can get a better price from Bob without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, how about we settle at $925,000? It's a small step from your last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price, allowing for more potential negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but also emphasizing that my offer is a fair compromise. I'm trying to position the $925,000 as a small step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

By making a small counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility while still maintaining a position above Bob's current offer. This gives me a stronger negotiating position, while also signaling my willingness to reach a deal."
