Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling for above $10,500 is still more profitable than John's offer.
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
