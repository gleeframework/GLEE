"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the time we've already spent discussing the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I believe the product is valuable, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10500.0,Alice,5,
