Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be highly valuable to your business. Given its potential to generate significant returns, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This allows for a healthy margin for both of us, while ensuring you secure a game-changing asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than John's offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I still have 9 rounds to make a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  Considering the substantial value this product brings to your business, I believe a price closer to $900,000 would be more equitable. This would still be a very attractive deal for you and would allow me to secure a reasonable return. Let's aim for a win-win scenario!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $875,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I've already compromised significantly from my initial price, and I have 6 more rounds to try and secure a deal closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm getting closer to your target, $875,000 still falls short of what the product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000, but this is my final compromise.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get even closer to my target. How about we try $880,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $10,000 less than my previous counteroffer and much closer to my bottom line than selling to John.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of losing a deal altogether outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
