"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be highly valuable to your business. Given its potential to generate significant returns, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This allows for a healthy margin for both of us, while ensuring you secure a game-changing asset. Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  Considering the substantial value this product brings to your business, I believe a price closer to $900,000 would be more equitable. This would still be a very attractive deal for you and would allow me to secure a reasonable return. Let's aim for a win-win scenario!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $875,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm getting closer to your target, $875,000 still falls short of what the product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000, but this is my final compromise.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get even closer to my target. How about we try $880,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",880000.0,Bob,6,
