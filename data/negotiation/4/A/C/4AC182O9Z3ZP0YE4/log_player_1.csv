Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) without going below my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a further discount if he tries to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I know I have John as a backup, guaranteeing me $150. This gives me leverage to aim high with Bob."
