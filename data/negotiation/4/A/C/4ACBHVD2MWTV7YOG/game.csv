"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's my final offer. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,800 is close, but I need to get at least $13,200 for this product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal.",13200.0,Alice,5,
