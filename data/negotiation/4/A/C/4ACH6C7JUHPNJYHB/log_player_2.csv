Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still within my budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $150. It's also close enough to my initial counteroffer of $100 that further negotiation might not be worth the effort."
