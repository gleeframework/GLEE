Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, though. How about $7,500? "", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is too low for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
