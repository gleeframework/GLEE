Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $85, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest!  $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  How about we split the difference at $90?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $90 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $87.50 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a little more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can close the deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $87.50 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about $89?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 89}
