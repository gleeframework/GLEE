"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. That's the lowest I can go.",9000.0,Bob,4,
