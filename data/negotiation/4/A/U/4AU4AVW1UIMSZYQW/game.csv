"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,350,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which still gives you a substantial margin. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
