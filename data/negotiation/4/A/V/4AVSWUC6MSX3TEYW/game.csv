"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to pay that price for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1250000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1100000. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1180000. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1180000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'll make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to go up to $1150000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1150000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1160000. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product.",1160000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Alice. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'll meet you at $1170000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",1170000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1170000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1190000. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product.",1190000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1200000, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
