"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let's see if we can come to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500,  which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $9,500 is unfortunately still too low for me. Given my costs and the value of the product, I'm not able to go lower than $10,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. However, if you're not able to go higher, I'll need to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
