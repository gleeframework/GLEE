"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $9,500 is unfortunately still too low for me. Given my costs and the value of the product, I'm not able to go lower than $10,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. However, if you're not able to go higher, I'll need to explore other options.
