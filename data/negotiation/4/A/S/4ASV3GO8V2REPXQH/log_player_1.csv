"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with a question to invite Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Sell to John is not the best option yet:** While selling to John guarantees $120, I can potentially get closer to that amount by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight concession:** I'm reducing my price from $115 to $110, showing flexibility.
* **Reiterate product value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm using a question to encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is getting closer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.
* **Selling to John is still not optimal:**  While selling to John guarantees $120, there's still a chance of getting a slightly better price with Bob, especially since we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair.  $107.50 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $110. This is really my bottom line, but I'm happy to continue talking if you have another proposal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but polite:** I'm sticking to my $110 price point, but I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation open. 
* **Show commitment to my price:**  I emphasize that $110 is my bottom line to make it clear I won't go any lower.
* **Encourage further dialogue:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make another counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation going while maintaining my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're at your bottom line, but I'm still trying to make a deal. Would you be willing to meet me at $106.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds (6 out of 10).
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $106.50 is still far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $120, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer. 

While I'd like to get a higher price, it's risky to continue with Bob considering the time constraint.  John offers a sure deal that meets my minimum, so it's the most sensible choice at this point."
