"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I think a starting price of $14,500 feels fair. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $14,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $13,500. Would you consider $13,600? It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal today.",13600.0,Alice,5,
