Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to purchase the product at a lower price, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and market demand. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still looking to save some money, but $975,000 is getting closer to the value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,012,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What are your thoughts?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $993,750 is a good step in the right direction. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet that price.  My absolute best offer is $1,004,375.  If this works for you, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 1004375}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1,004,375, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made several concessions, and I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Since I've reached my limit, I'm going to stand firm at $1,025,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What's your next move? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is holding firm and we are running out of rounds.  It's unlikely we can get her below $1,025,000 at this point. Accepting her offer is the best way to guarantee we get the product below John's price."
