"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe would be of great benefit to you. While the market value is significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you and allows me to move this product quickly. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is lower than the market value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You can do better."
