Bob's offer:

I'm willing to make one more compromise and propose $950,000. I think this is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can meet me halfway. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher than his $950,000 offer.  He's aware you have an alternative buyer and is using that as leverage. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's standing offer. At this point, securing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John makes the most business sense."
