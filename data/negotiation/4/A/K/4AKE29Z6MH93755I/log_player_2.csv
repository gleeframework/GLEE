Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to keep your budget under $475,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $490,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your budget. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $490,000

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. While I might be able to push her a little lower in the next few rounds, the difference is not significant enough to risk her walking away or me running out of rounds. Accepting at $490,000 is a good deal."
