"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth a significant amount to you. Let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John is an option, Bob should explore if he can get a better price from Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and above Alice's minimum acceptable price.  By proposing a concrete price, Bob shows he's serious about making a deal while leaving room for negotiation.  This also sets the stage for future rounds, giving Bob some leverage to potentially push the price down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $1,350,000? This still leaves room for both of us to make a good profit. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He's already demonstrated that he's willing to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a lower price. It's important to remember that buying from John is still an option if the negotiation with Alice falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's previous offer, showing that he's willing to compromise while still staying within his budget. It also demonstrates that he's actively trying to find a middle ground.  By suggesting a concrete price, Bob is making it clear that he is serious about finalizing the deal. The message also emphasizes the potential benefits for both parties, making the offer more appealing to Alice."
