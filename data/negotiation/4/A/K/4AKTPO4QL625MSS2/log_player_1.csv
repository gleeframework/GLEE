Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $4,000, which is a good return.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob is still getting a good deal, as he values the product at $15,000. This makes him more likely to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you have some wiggle room to negotiate a price that works for both of you. 

By offering a price that's attractive to Bob but still profitable for you, you increase the likelihood of a successful sale while maximizing your earnings."
