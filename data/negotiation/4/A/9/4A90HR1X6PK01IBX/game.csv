"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1500000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's my absolute limit. If this isn't acceptable, I'm prepared to move on to another option.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive maintenance package, which normally costs $50000. This way, you'll get the product, warranty, and maintenance package for $1250000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
