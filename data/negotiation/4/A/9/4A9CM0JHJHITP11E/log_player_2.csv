Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

While I could push Alice further, there's a risk she'll refuse to go lower. Accepting at $725,000 secures a decent discount compared to John's $800,000 offer."
