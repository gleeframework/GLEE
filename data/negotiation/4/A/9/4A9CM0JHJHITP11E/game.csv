"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",725000.0,Alice,5,
