"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $180. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",180.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $180 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $150.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale.",150.0,Bob,4,,
