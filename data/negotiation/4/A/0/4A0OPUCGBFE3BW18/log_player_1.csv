Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500.  I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed a sale at $10,000 to John, so there's a safety net."
