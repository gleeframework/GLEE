"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to both of us, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we consider $750,000 for the product? I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still not able to meet at $850,000, but I would like to propose $825,000. This price allows me to stay within my budget while also providing you with a reasonable profit. I look forward to your response.",825000.0,Bob,4,
