{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential compromise.  It also frames the offer as a fair price, hoping to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to both of us, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we consider $750,000 for the product? I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still not able to meet at $850,000, but I would like to propose $825,000. This price allows me to stay within my budget while also providing you with a reasonable profit. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum threshold of $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
