At this point, Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum value ($1,000,000), but I'm still not comfortable with his current offer. Since I'm not willing to drop the price further and Bob seems unwilling to raise his offer, it's best to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. It's important to remember that my goal is to maximize profit, and accepting Bob's offer would be a significant loss compared to selling to John."
