"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
