Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
