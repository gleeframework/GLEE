"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
