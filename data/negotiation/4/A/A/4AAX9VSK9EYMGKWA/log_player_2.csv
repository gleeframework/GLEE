"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a significant buffer to work with before you need to consider buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $850,000 is still above my ideal price range.  I can still try to negotiate a lower price and save some more money.  I'm not in a hurry and have the option to buy from John if I need to."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $825,000.  While this is still above my ideal price, it's getting close.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether.  It's also significantly cheaper than buying from John.  It makes sense to accept this offer to secure the product."
