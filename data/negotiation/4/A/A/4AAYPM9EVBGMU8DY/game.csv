"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it's worth $900,000 to you.  Let's start the negotiation with that figure.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you believing in the value of the product. While I see the potential, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $750,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
