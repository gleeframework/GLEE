Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's reasonable for Bob:**  Bob values the product at $150, so a $120 price point is still a good deal for him. 
* **It sets the stage for negotiation:** By starting at a price slightly below your ideal, you can potentially gain more profit through negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer at $110.  It's a compromise, but it's still closer to my initial offer of $120.  Let's see if Bob's willing to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's higher than selling to John and closer to my desired profit margin.  I'll accept his offer."
