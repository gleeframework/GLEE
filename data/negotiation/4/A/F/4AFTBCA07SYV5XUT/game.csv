"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $8,750 for the product. This represents a significant reduction from your initial offer and is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I believe this is a good deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've already compromised on. I hope we can reach an agreement at this point.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value we've both established. I believe this is a good compromise that allows us to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $9,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've already compromised on. I hope we can reach an agreement at this point.",9100.0,Alice,7,
