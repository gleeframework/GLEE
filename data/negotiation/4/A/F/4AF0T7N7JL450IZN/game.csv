"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $8,500? That's a fair price considering your value and my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $8,750?  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
