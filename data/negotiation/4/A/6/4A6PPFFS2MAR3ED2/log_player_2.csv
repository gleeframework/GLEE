Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're getting close, but we're still not quite there. We're willing to make one more concession. We're counteroffering at $1,115,000. We believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to your business.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $1,125,000 as possible.  We've hit a point where the difference between her offer ($1,115,000) and my last offer ($1,100,000) is relatively small. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results, and continuing risks her pulling back or me running out of rounds.  This price is well within my budget."
