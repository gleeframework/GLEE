"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My starting price is $1,150,000. I'm open to discussion, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair starting point given the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to me and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,050,000 is below my initial asking price, it's closer to the value I place on the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain value from this transaction. Let's make this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This price is within my budget and reflects the value I place on the product.  I hope we can find a middle ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  While I'm willing to compromise, $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,087,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
