"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My starting price is $1,150,000. I'm open to discussion, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair starting point given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  It's always a good idea to start with rejecting the first offer to signal you're serious about getting a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to me and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,050,000 is below my initial asking price, it's closer to the value I place on the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain value from this transaction. Let's make this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than your ideal price.  You have a better chance of getting a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This price is within my budget and reflects the value I place on the product.  I hope we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  While I'm willing to compromise, $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,087,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and her offer is now very close to your ideal price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and you having to buy from John for a higher price is too high. Accepting her offer is the best way to secure the product at a reasonable price."
