"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000 for it. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I still believe that $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. Could we possibly agree on this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better result. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same price, it makes the most sense to sell to him now and avoid further negotiation."
