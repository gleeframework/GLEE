```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially reach a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial target of $1,000,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target,  $920,000 is a good price and significantly higher than John's offer.  Further negotiation might take longer and might not result in a much better price, so it's better to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
