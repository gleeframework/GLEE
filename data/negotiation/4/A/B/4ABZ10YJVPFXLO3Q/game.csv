"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm  prepared to pay $9500 for it. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000. This is my final compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
