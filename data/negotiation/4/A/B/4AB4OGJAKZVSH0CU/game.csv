"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the potential value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the potential value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of its value to you. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
