{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $80, but below my minimum valuation of $120. This gives me a chance to sell the product without having to resort to John, while still getting a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but $70 is simply unacceptable. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, and I believe you'll find the product very valuable.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $85 is a reasonable compromise.  It's above Bob's initial offer, and it's still a good deal for me considering that I can sell to John for $120."
