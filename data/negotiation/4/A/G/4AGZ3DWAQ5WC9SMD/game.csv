"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  $8,000 is the highest I can go.  It's a fair offer considering my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $10,000? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to be flexible.",10000.0,Alice,5,
