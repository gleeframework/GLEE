"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $10,000? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to be flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is not budging significantly from her initial offers. It's unlikely she'll come down to $8,000.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
