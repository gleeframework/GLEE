"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose the details publicly, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, but I understand it's a big decision. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this, but ultimately the decision is yours.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
