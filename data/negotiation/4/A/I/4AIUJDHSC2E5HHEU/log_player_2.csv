"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, it's still above his maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $11,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $10,000, it's the most cost-effective option at this point.  Further negotiation with Alice risks going over budget, while John offers a guaranteed price within his budget."
