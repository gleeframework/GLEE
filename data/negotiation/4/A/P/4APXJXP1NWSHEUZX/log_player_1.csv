Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm now offering a price closer to my minimum, but still higher than what I'd get from John. This signals my willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal."

Bob's offer is only $50,000 less than what I'd get from John, and it's higher than my minimum.  It's likely we won't get any closer in negotiations, so I'll accept and secure the sale."
