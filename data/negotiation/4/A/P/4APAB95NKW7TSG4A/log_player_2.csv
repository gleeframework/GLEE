"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. It's something that could be incredibly beneficial for your business, but I understand its worth might vary depending on your needs.  I'm willing to let it go for $900000.  This is a significant discount from its true value to me.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further. If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to see this go to someone who can truly appreciate its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
