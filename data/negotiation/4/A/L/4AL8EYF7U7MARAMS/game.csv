"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. Would you be willing to accept that?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $87.50 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $91.25?  This way, we both get a fair price.",91.25,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise! However, $91.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $90. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Would you be willing to accept that?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're definitely getting closer to a price I can work with.  How about we meet at $92.50? It's just a little bit more than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise given the value of this product.",92.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again! However, $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer $91.25. I think this is the best compromise we can reach. Would you be willing to accept that?",91.25,Bob,8,
