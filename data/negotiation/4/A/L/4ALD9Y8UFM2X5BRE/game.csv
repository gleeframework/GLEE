"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $130 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $160. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $130, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",145.0,Alice,5,
