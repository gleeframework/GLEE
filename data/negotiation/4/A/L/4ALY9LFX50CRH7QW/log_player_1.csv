"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be acceptable considering the product's value to me. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my minimum of $150.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a rapport with Bob and increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. I can use this to try and negotiate a higher price.
* **Option 3 is a fallback:**  Selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but not going too far below my minimum. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Encouraging Response:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is closer to what I can afford. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, indicating a potential for a better price. 
* **John is the safety net:**  Selling to John for $150 is always a secure option, but I'm willing to risk it for a potentially higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $115 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  How about $125? It's a fair midpoint between our positions, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Negotiation:** I'm demonstrating a desire to find a compromise while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fairness and Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair middle ground, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Encouraging Response:** The message remains positive and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $125 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 is only $30 away from my minimum of $150. This is a significant difference, and it's likely he won't budge much further.
* **Risk of Lowering the Price:**  Further negotiation may lead to a price that is too close to my minimum and would not be worth the effort. 
* **Secure Sale:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and avoids the potential for a lower offer from Bob in the next round. 
* **Time is a Factor:** With limited rounds remaining, it's important to secure a profitable sale.

While I'm not getting the maximum profit, selling to John now ensures a secure and acceptable outcome."
