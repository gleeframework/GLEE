"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is closer to what I can afford. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $115 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  How about $125? It's a fair midpoint between our positions, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $125 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,6,
