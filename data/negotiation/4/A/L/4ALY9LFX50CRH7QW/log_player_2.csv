"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $175 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  There's room to negotiate further. You want to save as much money as possible, so continue trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is closer to what I can afford. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $115 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  How about $125? It's a fair midpoint between our positions, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is still above your ideal price point of $100, it's still a good opportunity to negotiate further. You have more rounds left, so it's worth seeing if you can reach a price closer to your budget."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $125 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
