Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves space for him to counter-offer.
* **High Anchor:**  The initial price sets a high anchor, making it more likely Bob will offer a price closer to our desired range than if we started lower.
* **Alternative Option:** We have a safety net with John ($1,000,000), so we can afford to aim high with Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
