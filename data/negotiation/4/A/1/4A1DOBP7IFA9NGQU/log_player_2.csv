"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item valued at $8,000 to you, while also allowing me to maximize my earnings. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I can try negotiating a lower price that's closer to my $8,000 limit. It's good to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price and would be a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and signal my budget constraints. 
* **Polite and Collaborative:**  I want to maintain a positive tone and suggest that this deal can benefit both of us.
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to pay closer to my $8,000 maximum. By starting low, I'm hoping to steer the negotiation in that direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your offer, I am proposing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but I'm still aiming to get closer to my $8,000 limit. There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,600? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7600
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $7,600, I'm meeting Alice halfway between her current offer ($8,200) and my previous counteroffer ($7,000).  
* **Signaling Flexibility:**  This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also holding my ground on getting a reasonable price.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm getting closer to my $8,000 limit, and this offer might be tempting enough for Alice to accept."
