"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While I value the product, $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can do $825,000, and that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
