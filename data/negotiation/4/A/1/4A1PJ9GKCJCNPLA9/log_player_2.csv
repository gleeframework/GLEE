"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on this product, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can save more money by negotiating with Alice.  Even if Alice rejects your first counteroffer, you'll still be in a better position to get a lower price than buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a great value.

You're still closer to your goal price of $1,200,000 by negotiating with Alice.  Even though you could buy from John now, you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."

Alice is clearly not willing to go much lower than $1,325,000.  You're now at a point where it makes more sense to buy from John and save the time and effort of further negotiations."
