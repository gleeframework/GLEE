"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your desired selling price and the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to negotiate.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling price. I believe we can close the deal at this point.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
