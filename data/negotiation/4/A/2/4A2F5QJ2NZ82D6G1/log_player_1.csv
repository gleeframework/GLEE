``` 

This offer aims for a good middle ground. It's much closer to Bob's value than my minimum, giving him a strong incentive to accept. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low, and while I could sell to John for $800,000, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low. I understand it's a valuable product to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and agree on $850,000. This gives us both a good deal and avoids going back and forth further. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I believe I can get a better price with another counteroffer, and I'm not yet ready to settle for the guaranteed $800,000 from John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle right in the middle at $800,000? It seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to John for the same amount, Bob is a potential future customer and building a positive relationship with him is important.  Accepting his offer ensures a successful negotiation and potentially opens the door for future collaborations."
