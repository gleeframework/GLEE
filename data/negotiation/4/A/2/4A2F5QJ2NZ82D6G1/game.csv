"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low. I understand it's a valuable product to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and agree on $850,000. This gives us both a good deal and avoids going back and forth further. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm offering $825,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle right in the middle at $800,000? It seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
