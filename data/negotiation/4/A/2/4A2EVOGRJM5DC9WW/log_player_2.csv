Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can likely get a better price. He should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the item."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, Bob. I'm thinking that $1300000 is a fair price, but I can see that you're still not comfortable with it. I'm willing to come down to $1280000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. He is very close to his budget, and he is only one round away from being able to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or if unsuccessful, buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,280,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the item and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make a serious concession, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need you to meet me halfway on the next concession. If you're willing to meet me at $1300000, I'll throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm counting on your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to take the guaranteed price from John than to risk continuing negotiations with Alice and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John."
