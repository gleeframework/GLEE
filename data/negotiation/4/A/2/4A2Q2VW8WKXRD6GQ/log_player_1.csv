"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $600,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $675,000 is better than $600,000, it's still too far below my target. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round and aim for a price closer to $750,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to find common ground here. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle at $700,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 700000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While we're getting closer, $685,000 is still not enough.  I'm confident I can get a slightly better price, and I'm willing to risk another round.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for $700,000 or higher."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I feel like we're dancing around the same number.  My final offer is $690,000.  It's a fair deal and allows us both to walk away happy.  If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $690,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing a guaranteed $800,000.  It's a better choice for me at this point."
