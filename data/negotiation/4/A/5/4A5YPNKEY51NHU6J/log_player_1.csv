Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows room for negotiation and potentially reaches a price closer to my ideal value while still being potentially attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell for less.  I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm counteroffering at my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is a fair price for me, and it's still potentially attractive to Bob, as it's higher than his initial offer but lower than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell for less.  Therefore, I'll accept the offer from John, as it meets my minimum price requirement and provides a better outcome for me."
