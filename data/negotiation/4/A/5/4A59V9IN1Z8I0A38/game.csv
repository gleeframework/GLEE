"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle on $600,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to my business.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $600,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
