"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount less than the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate.  It also leaves some room for me to lower the price if necessary, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer,  showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping my price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000.  I'm gradually lowering my price, but staying above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal, but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to counter in the next round, but it's getting close to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, showing Bob I'm serious about closing the deal. However, it's still above my minimum and potentially gives me a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds left, Bob has consistently countered with lower offers than my counteroffers.  This makes me concerned that he's not seriously considering my value of the product.  While $1,025,000 is still a good price, I don't believe I can get much higher in these remaining rounds, and I'm risking that Bob will simply reject my final offer. To avoid that risk, I will sell the product to John for $800,000, securing a guaranteed sale and avoiding further negotiation."
