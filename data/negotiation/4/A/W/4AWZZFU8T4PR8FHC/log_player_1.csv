Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with my highest desired price, as it's the most I could possibly earn and still be better off than selling to John. I'm confident Bob won't accept this offer immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I believe I can get a higher price from Bob, or I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90. This is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum price, and it shows Bob I'm willing to compromise. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $85 isn't my ideal price, it's above my minimum and still a good deal.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it risks losing Bob entirely and having to sell to John for $100.  It's better to secure a sale now and avoid the risk of losing out on a potential profit."
