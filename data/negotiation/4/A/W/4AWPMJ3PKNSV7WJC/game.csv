"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's significantly closer to your initial offer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to close this deal, how about it?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is the price I was thinking of from the start. Would you be willing to accept this price?",12500.0,Bob,6,
