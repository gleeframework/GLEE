Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,200,000 is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to adjust if needed.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, emphasizing the value of the product. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum, I aim to:

* **Secure a quick deal:**  Bob may be willing to accept the price without much haggling.
* **Maximize potential gains:** I'll leave room for negotiation if Bob counters, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain John as a backup:** If the negotiation fails, I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **Proceeding to the next round:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, hopefully leading to a more favorable outcome.

**Strategy:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, I'm not giving up just yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price, using John's offer as leverage. If Bob is serious about acquiring the product, he may be willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $1,150,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above Bob's perceived value, but closer to my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Message:** The message reiterates the value of the product and emphasizes the mutual benefit of a deal at this price.  It also conveys my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my position of strength.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Narrow the gap:**  The price is closer to Bob's offer, potentially encouraging him to accept.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It's still above Bob's initial offer, reminding him that I have a better alternative (John's offer).
* **Build momentum:**  By showing willingness to compromise, I increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I could get from John. 
* **Proceeding to the next round:** I'm not willing to settle for a price that leaves me with a substantial loss compared to John's offer.  I'll counter again with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to convince Bob to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm using John's offer as a strong bargaining chip. By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to hold out for a better price. My goal is to push Bob closer to my target price by emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that I have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe $1,125,000 is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still ensuring you get a great deal. Let's make this happen. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $1,125,000 is a small increase from Bob's last offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also standing my ground.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's position while emphasizing the unique value of the product and the potential for mutual benefit. This keeps the negotiation open and constructive.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:** By making a small increase, I demonstrate willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong position.
* **Increase Pressure:** The slight increase in price can potentially push Bob to accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Set a Final Deadline:** I'm setting a price close to my minimum acceptable, indicating that this may be my final offer before I go with John.

This approach combines a slight increase in price with positive communication to create a sense of urgency and nudge Bob closer to my desired price."
