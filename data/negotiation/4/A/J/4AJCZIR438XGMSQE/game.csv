"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500? I'm confident you'll still find that to be a great value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but unfortunately, $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $10,000.  How about we meet at $10,200? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
