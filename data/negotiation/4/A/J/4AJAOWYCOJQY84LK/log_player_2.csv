# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is too high, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum price. He can still get the product from John for $12,000, so he should continue negotiating with Alice to see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000 yet. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than before, it's still above his maximum price. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if they can reach a price closer to his budget. Remember, he can always buy from John for $12,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $13,250, which is a solid middle ground. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $13,250. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,750. This is a reasonable price, considering the value you place on the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  He's been negotiating with Alice for a while, and it's clear that they are not going to reach a price he's comfortable with.  Rather than continue negotiating and risk running out of rounds, it's better for Bob to secure the product at his desired price from John."
