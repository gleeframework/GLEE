Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal for a product you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows for potentially maximizing profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $10,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still a ""deal"" compared to my guaranteed sale price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to my $12,000 goal.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I will likely counter with a slightly lower price (e.g., $9,500) before resorting to selling to John at $12,000."
