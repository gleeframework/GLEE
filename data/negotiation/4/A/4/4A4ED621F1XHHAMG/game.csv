"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $500,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's unique qualities while still offering a significant discount from my initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond what I can afford.  Let's be realistic here - I need a price that works for both of us. How about $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we need to find some common ground on the price.  To be frank,  $650,000 is significantly below its value and doesn't reflect the benefits it offers. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000.  This offer takes into account your budget considerations while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a firm budget.  I can go up to $800,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible throughout our negotiation. To be transparent, taking anything less than $1,400,000 would mean selling at a significant loss.  That said, I do want to find a way to work together. If you're unable to meet that price, could you potentially offer something else of value as part of the deal?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
