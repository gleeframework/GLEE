"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You're aiming for a price closer to $800,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into a deal that's not beneficial to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I'm seeing in the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. Considering the value I believe the product holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $900,000 is still too high for you.  You're still aiming for a price closer to $800,000, and you have 7 more rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you a better chance of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $850,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $875,000, which is closer to my original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $875,000 is still above your target price of $800,000. You still have 5 rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to try and push for a better price. It's also possible Alice might be willing to come down further, especially if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $825,000, which is a fair price considering we're both looking to close this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go down to $825,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $850,000, which is closer to your target price, you only have three rounds left.  Considering you have an alternative offer from John at $800,000, it's more beneficial to take the sure thing and buy from John. You've already made significant progress in the negotiations with Alice, and there's a chance she may not budge further. By buying from John, you secure the product for a price you're comfortable with and avoid the risk of not closing a deal with Alice within the remaining rounds."
