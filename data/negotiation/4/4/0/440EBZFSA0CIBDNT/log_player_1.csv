"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values it at, but still within a range that might be attractive to him given the potential value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider something closer to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $10,000? That would be a price where I think we'd both feel good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have more rounds to negotiate and don't want to settle for a significantly lower price, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $10,000 is simply not workable for me. To be fair to both of us, let's meet at $12,000. It's a good compromise that leaves us both with a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this: I can do $10,500. That's a firm offer, and it reflects how serious I am about buying this product. It's a win-win, giving us both some benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I've got John as a backup and still have a few rounds to go. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would give us both a good deal and allow for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 11500}
