"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to accept such a high price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider something closer to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Start Low:**  While $8,000 is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, it sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Appear Serious:**  The message expresses interest but is firm about the budget limitations. This signals that you're serious but also leaves room for Alice to counter.
* **Long Game:** We have time to negotiate, and going low initially allows for movement towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $13,000 is still significantly more than what John is offering. We've signaled our budget, and there's no need to jump at this offer. By continuing to negotiate, we might be able to secure a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $10,000? That would be a price where I think we'd both feel good about the deal."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Direct Approach:**  We're now proposing our walk-away price ($10,000). 
* **Justification:** We're giving Alice a reason to accept by highlighting it as a win-win.
* **Pressure:** By putting our best price forward, we're subtly increasing the pressure on Alice, as she knows we have an alternative option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $10,000 is simply not workable for me. To be fair to both of us, let's meet at $12,000. It's a good compromise that leaves us both with a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our target, but we're still overpaying compared to John's offer.  We've been firm with our $10,000 limit, and there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she'll budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this: I can do $10,500. That's a firm offer, and it reflects how serious I am about buying this product. It's a win-win, giving us both some benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Small Concession:**  We're signaling some flexibility by moving slightly above our target price ($10,000 to $10,500). This might be enough to get Alice to agree.
* **""Firm Offer"":** By calling it a ""firm offer,"" we're increasing the pressure and implying this is our final concession. 
* **Focus on Agreement:**  We're reiterating the ""win-win"" aspect and aiming for a swift resolution. Alice might be more inclined to accept now, rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would give us both a good deal and allow for a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $11,500. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll reach our $10,000 target. We've made good progress, but we have a guaranteed option with John at that price. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John to secure the best deal."
