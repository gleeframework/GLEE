"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider something closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000, and it's a fair price for me.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $10,000? That would be a price where I think we'd both feel good about the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $10,000 is simply not workable for me. To be fair to both of us, let's meet at $12,000. It's a good compromise that leaves us both with a reasonable profit.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this: I can do $10,500. That's a firm offer, and it reflects how serious I am about buying this product. It's a win-win, giving us both some benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would give us both a good deal and allow for a successful transaction.",11500.0,Alice,7,
