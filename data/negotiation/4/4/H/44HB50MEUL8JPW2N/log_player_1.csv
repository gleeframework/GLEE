Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price below your minimum ($15,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying above John's offer. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay *above* his perceived value of $12,000.  
* **Risk Tolerance:** A higher initial offer risks losing Bob but could lead to a larger profit. A lower offer is less risky but might leave money on the table."
