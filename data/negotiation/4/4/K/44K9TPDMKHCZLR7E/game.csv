"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is my final offer for now, let me know if it's acceptable to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
