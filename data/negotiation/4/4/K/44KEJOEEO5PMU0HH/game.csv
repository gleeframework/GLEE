"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to buy it for $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
