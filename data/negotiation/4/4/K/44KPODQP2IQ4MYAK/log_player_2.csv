"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset I know you'll find beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Buying from John for $1,200,000 saves Bob $200,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
