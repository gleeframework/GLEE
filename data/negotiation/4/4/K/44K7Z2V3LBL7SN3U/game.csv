"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. $120 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something below $80. Would you be willing to consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product as cheaply as possible. However, I've already gone quite low with my previous offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $100. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the quality of the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
