Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a decent markup from my minimum value, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $80 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $70, as that is below my minimum value. I will try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm countering with $90. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while also ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is just above my minimum value, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal from him.  I'm willing to accept this offer rather than risk losing the sale and getting only $80 from John."
