"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, the product's value is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this reflects a more accurate price point.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This price allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
