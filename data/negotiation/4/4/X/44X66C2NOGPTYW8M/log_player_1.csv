Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I know you'll benefit greatly from it. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Given its worth, I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price and potentially appeal to Bob's desire for a valuable asset.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always decrease the price, potentially settling somewhere above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject a high offer outright. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit by aiming for the highest reasonable price."
