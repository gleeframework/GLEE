"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.
