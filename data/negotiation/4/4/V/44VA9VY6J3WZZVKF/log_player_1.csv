Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable and scarce. 
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, we can still sell the product at our minimum acceptable price."
