"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you meet me at that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob.  However, $7,000 is considerably below my bottom line.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $7,500? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints but I need to be fair to myself too. This offer is already a compromise. How about we settle at $8,250 and we have a deal?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'm ready to make a deal.",7800.0,Bob,6,
