"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product for $9,500. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you and it's a very fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than John's price of $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your value for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $9,000.  This is a great deal considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  Buying from Alice for $9,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer or the negotiation dragging on means accepting this offer is the best choice."
