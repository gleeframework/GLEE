You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  You can counteroffer Alice to see if you can get a better price."

I'm offering Alice $8,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and is closer to what I'm willing to pay. It's a good starting point for negotiations, and I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet me halfway."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I will reject her offer and continue negotiating.  It's worth trying to get closer to my target price before considering John's offer."

I'm offering Alice $9,000 for the product.  This is a compromise between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping she'll recognize the value in closing the deal and accept this price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:

Alice is getting closer to my price, but not close enough.  It seems like we are at an impasse. Since I can get the product from John for $8,000,  I'm going to choose to buy from John."
