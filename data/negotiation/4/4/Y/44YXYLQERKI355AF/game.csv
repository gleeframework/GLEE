"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $820,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise. However, $820,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $790,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",790000.0,Alice,5,
