"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and your asking price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer, and I would like to counter with a price of $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable given the value it holds for me, and it represents a significant compromise from my initial offer. I hope we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
