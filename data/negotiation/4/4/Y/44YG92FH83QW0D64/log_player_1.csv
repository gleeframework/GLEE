Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth at least $20,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down a bit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's worth to Bob and your willingness to offer a discount, you create a sense of value and urgency.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you aim for $18,000, you're open to Bob negotiating down slightly.  However, you have John as a backup ensuring you won't go below your minimum price."
