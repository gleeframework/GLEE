"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a good middle ground between our values. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $850,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  Since Bob is clearly interested, there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still holding firm on getting a significant profit. I'm also reminding Bob of the value he'll be getting.  Let's see if this gets us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be at $900,000 for this to make sense. Do you think we can make that work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm getting closer to my target price, but I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $950,000 at this point.  I'm confident I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. But $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us move forward."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm offering a compromise price, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good profit. I'm confident that $925,000 is a fair price that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $910,000?  This is a fair offer and allows us both to benefit.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting close to my desired price, and there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting $910,000 is a good compromise and ensures a strong profit."
