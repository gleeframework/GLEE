"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,100,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100500.0,Bob,4,
