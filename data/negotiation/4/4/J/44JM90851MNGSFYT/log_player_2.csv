"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to acquire this item. We're offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a discount. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is already below my maximum budget of $10,000. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a price I'm comfortable with, even if it might be possible to negotiate a slightly lower price. It's generally better to secure a good deal quickly rather than risk losing it by pushing for a potentially insignificant discount."
