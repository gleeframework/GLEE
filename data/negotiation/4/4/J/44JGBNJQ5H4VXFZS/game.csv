"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I think that's a fair price that would be mutually beneficial.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a little high for me.  Let's try $10,500. That's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford, and it's still a good deal for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
