"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a fair profit for me. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
