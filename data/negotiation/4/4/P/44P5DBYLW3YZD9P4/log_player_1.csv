Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to risk losing the deal with John for a few hundred dollars."
