"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than its worth to you, and I'll be getting a great price for it. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
