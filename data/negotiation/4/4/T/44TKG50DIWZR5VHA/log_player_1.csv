``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a reasonable price that allows for some negotiation, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you a strong bargaining position.  We'll see how Bob responds and then adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to take his offer, it's better to try and get a higher price.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits you'll gain from it.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate.  Hopefully, it will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but it still keeps the deal within a range that's beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still a bit away from your target, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,137,500 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1137500}
```

This counteroffer is a small concession from my previous offer but is still higher than Bob's current offer. It shows that I'm flexible but that I still want to get a price closer to my minimum.  Hopefully, this will convince Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still trying to get as much as you can, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his offer of $1,125,000, which is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already made multiple concessions, and it's unlikely Bob will change his mind.  To avoid further loss, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get my desired price."
