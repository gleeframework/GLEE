"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking that considering the product's value to you, I could do slightly better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I can do $9200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What are your thoughts?",9200.0,Alice,5,

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $8800. I'm trying to find a balance between the value I'll get from the product and the price I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a balance, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my own needs. I can do $9000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable going any lower than that.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my own needs. I can do $8800, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable going any lower than that. What are your thoughts?",8800.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $8800. I've reached my limit and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $8500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",8500.0,Bob,10,
