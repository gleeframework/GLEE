Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John acts as a price floor at $15,000, Alice wants to see if she can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still remaining above Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A strong initial offer can help gauge Bob's level of interest in the product. If he flat out rejects it, Alice knows to move on to John without wasting time on further negotiation."
