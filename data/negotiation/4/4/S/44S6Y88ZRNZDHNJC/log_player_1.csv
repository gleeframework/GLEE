I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price.  I'll see how Bob responds before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, but it's still higher than my minimum price and hopefully,  a price Bob might be willing to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my initial desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also a better deal than selling to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
