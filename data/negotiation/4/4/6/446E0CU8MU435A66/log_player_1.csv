Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  By emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value,"" you frame the product as highly desirable.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor point, leaving room for potential negotiation down to a price still well above your minimum.
* **Confidence:**  Phrasing like ""I believe this represents a fair deal"" conveys confidence in your pricing.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still staying above your $1,500,000 safety net with John."
