"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This is a significant price point for me, but I believe in the potential it holds for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
