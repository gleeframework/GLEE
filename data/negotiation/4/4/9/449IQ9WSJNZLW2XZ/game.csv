"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
