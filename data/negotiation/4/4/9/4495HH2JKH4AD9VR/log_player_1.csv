{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (though unlikely given his $100 valuation).
* **Slightly Above Bob's Value:** The price is just above Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll decline, leading you to the guaranteed $120 from John. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might surprisingly accept $119, even if it's above his perceived value. This strategy prioritizes the higher potential profit."
