Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He can get the product for $11,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still within his budget of $15,000. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject and he might end up paying the full $15,000 to John."
