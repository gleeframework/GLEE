Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim for a price higher than that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob if he counters your initial offer. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A price slightly below a round number like $20,000 might make it seem more appealing.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject $19,000 outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of securing the highest possible profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell it to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
