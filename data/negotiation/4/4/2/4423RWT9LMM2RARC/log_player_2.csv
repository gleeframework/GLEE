"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us, and it's the best price I can offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While $120 is more than Alice values the product, it's still $30 less than John's offer.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $150, and are getting it for $120, which is a good price."
