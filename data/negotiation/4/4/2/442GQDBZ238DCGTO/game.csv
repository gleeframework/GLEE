"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. How about we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $825,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your latest offer, so how about we meet at $837,500?",837500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I could potentially do $750,000, but that's really pushing my budget.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Alice,7,
