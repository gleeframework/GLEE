Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me ($12,000), hoping to maximize my profit. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, this offer leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $13,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to my initial price and a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and close to the price I'd get from John. Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
