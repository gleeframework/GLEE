"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. $12,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. I believe this is the best price I can offer, considering the value the product brings.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $10,500? This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're getting close to your target, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one last concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. If this doesn't work out, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
