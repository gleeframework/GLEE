Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and my minimum goal. I'll counteroffer to try and secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, while also maintaining a profitable selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range of my initial target and significantly higher than selling to John.  While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
