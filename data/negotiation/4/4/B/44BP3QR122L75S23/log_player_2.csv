{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above the product's value to her. This allows for some negotiation space, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price. There's still room to lower the price further without jeopardizing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This counteroffer is still within a reasonable range, and I believe it's likely to be accepted by Alice."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and while I would prefer to pay even less, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it. At this point, I believe accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sound decision."
