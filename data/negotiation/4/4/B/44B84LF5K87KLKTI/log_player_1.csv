Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair and reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but even if he gets a slight discount, you'll still make significantly more than selling to John.
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions you as offering a fair deal rather than haggling."
