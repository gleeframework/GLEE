"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $90, which would be $105. Would you be willing to consider that?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $80, which is the price John is offering. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a price of $95. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm afraid $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet John's offer of $80, which I think is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,6,
