(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests and seeking a price closer to my initial assessment of the product's value."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better offer from him. Selling to John would be less profitable.  It's time to secure the deal."
