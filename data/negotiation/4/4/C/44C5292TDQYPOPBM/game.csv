"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, $11000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $13000 to meet you halfway.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to make this deal work. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $12500. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Bob,4,
