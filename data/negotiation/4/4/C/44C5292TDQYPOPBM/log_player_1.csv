"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a rapport and create a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I highlight the value of the product, reinforcing Bob's perception of its worth.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he rejects, I'll either counter with a lower price or consider selling to John if I believe the negotiations are unlikely to yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, he acknowledges the product's value and is willing to pay a premium. This suggests there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage. If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000.  This will signal that I'm open to negotiating but won't accept a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to meet you halfway.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $13,000 represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value and emphasize the discount I'm offering, making it clear that $13,000 is a fair price for both of us.
* **Open Communication:** The message is open and invites further discussion, signaling my willingness to negotiate further if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, the deal is closed. If he rejects, I'll need to consider my options: 
* **Further Counteroffer:**  I might lower my price slightly, but I'll be wary of going too low.
* **Selling to John:** If the negotiations stall or Bob's offers consistently fall below my minimum, I'll consider selling to John to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $12500. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is a reasonable outcome considering the initial difference in our valuations.
* **No Further Negotiating Room:** Bob has stated that $12,500 is his highest offer.  Further negotiation would likely be unproductive and could lead to a breakdown in the deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I have John as a backup, I'm already four rounds in and each round increases the risk of the deal falling apart.  

**Next Steps:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price I'm comfortable with, minimizing the risk of further negotiations and potential loss of the deal."
