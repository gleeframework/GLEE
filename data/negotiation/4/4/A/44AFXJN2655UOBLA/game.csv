"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let me know if this is a price we can work with.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell at $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $800,000, so I'm offering $825,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
