Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $101 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5.

It's clear Bob is very price-sensitive and unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
