"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something that aligns perfectly with your needs. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $10,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,
