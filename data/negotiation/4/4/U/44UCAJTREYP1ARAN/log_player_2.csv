Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $6,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still a reasonable offer considering my maximum budget."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer to $6,800. This is a more substantial move towards Alice's price, but it's still a good deal for me. I'm hoping Alice will see that we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept the offer.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to get me a significantly better price.  While I'd love to pay less, $7,400 is a good deal compared to John's price.  It's time to close the deal."
