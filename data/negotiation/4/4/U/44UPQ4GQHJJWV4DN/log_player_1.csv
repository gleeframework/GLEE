This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I think it's a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit more for the product, Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high.  I'm confident that selling to John for $10,000 is the best course of action to ensure I get my minimum desired value."
