,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little though. How about $105?  Let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
