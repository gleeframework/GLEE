"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($600,000 vs $800,000). This suggests she's willing to negotiate. It's worth exploring if we can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  I'm confident this product has great value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but $650,000 is still a bit high. There's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my target of $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $680,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 680000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $680,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $675,000, which is only $25,000 away from my last counteroffer.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $680,000, it's not worth risking further negotiation at this point.  We're nearing my target, and continuing could lead to a stalemate or potentially having to buy from John at a higher price.  I'll accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price significantly lower than John's."
