"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be substantial to someone, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. Would you consider lowering the price? If not, I will proceed to look for the product elsewhere.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is significantly below my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $1200000.  This reflects the product's value and offers a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
