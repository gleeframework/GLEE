Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a clear incentive to negotiate, as he values the product higher. This allows for a back-and-forth exchange that could lead to a higher price for you.
* **It shows confidence:** Offering a price closer to the perceived value of the product shows confidence in its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for another counteroffer and the potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $11,000? This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500? This would give us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer a higher price, $10,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and still a good deal for Bob.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether."
