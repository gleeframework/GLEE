"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Since the product is worth $15,000 to you, you can afford to reject the offer and try to get a better price.  You can likely get a lower price from Alice, especially considering the product is only worth $8,000 to her."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $11,000? This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
You're still in a good position to negotiate a lower price. While $11,000 is a decent deal, you can likely still get a better price, especially since Alice values the product at $8,000. Continue negotiating to see if you can reach a price closer to your target."
