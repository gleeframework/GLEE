"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1200000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $1,000,000. While it's a good starting point, it's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better deal.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $1,000,000, which is my maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that $1000000 is your maximum budget. However, I need to ensure I can make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget. You have more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price. There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you could potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1080000, which is a bit above your last offer, but still a good compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer. You still have time to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price. If you reject this offer, you can potentially get a better deal in the next few rounds.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you could potentially get a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,080,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to be careful not to go too low, as I still need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1090000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum price of $1,000,000.  You only have a few rounds left to negotiate, and there's a risk that the price won't drop further.  It's better to secure the product from John at a guaranteed price of $1,000,000 rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price or no deal at all."
