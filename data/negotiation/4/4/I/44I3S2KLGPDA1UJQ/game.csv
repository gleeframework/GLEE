"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $1000000, which is my maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a profit.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that $1000000 is your maximum budget. However, I need to ensure I can make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1080000, which is a bit above your last offer, but still a good compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1080000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1025000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to be careful not to go too low, as I still need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1090000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
