"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. This deal presents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your decision, as I have another offer for $800000 that I'm also considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but you can do better.** You value the product at $1,000,000, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This means you'd save $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **However, you can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice.** Since she has another offer at $800,000, you have leverage. By rejecting her initial offer, you can potentially get her to come down closer to her desired price of $800,000, saving you even more money."
