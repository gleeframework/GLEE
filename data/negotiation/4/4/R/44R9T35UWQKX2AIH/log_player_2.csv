Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the product's worth to Alice, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and my initial offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get her down to my maximum of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still sticking to my initial offer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm willing to purchase it now. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to drop below $11,500, which is above my budget.  Rather than continue negotiating and risk the possibility of a deal falling through entirely, it's more prudent to buy from John at my desired price of $10,000. This guarantees I get the product within my budget."
