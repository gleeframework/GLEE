"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $8,500 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial price. Would you consider $9,000? It's a compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
