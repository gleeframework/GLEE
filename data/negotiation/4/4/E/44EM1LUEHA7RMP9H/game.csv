"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $8,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $7,500.  How about $7,250? I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,250 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,400. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",7400.0,Alice,5,
