Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum value ($1,200,000).  This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a good profit. I'm hoping that Bob, who values the product at $1,200,000, will see this as a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  To avoid further time wasted in negotiations, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired profit and saves time."
