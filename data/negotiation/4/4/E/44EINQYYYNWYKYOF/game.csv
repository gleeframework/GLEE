,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $15000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $13500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my investment in it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13200? I'm trying to make a fair offer, and I think this is a good compromise.",13200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $13200 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13700.  That's a fair compromise for us both, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",13700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $13700. Would you be willing to consider $13500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this is a fair price considering our previous offers.",13500.0,Bob,8,
