"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,080,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,030,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to get this deal done.",1030000.0,Bob,4,
