"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. There's a good chance you can get a better price by rejecting it and seeing if she'll come down.  You'll still have John as a backup option."
