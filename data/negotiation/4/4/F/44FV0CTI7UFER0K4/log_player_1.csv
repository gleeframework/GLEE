Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is trying to anchor the price lower, but his offer is still significantly above my minimum. I'll counter to keep him engaged.
