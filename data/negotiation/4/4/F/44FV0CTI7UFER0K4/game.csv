"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is lower than I can justify.  How about we settle on $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $1,225,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,150,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen - how about we land at $1,180,000?  I believe that represents a fair deal for both of us and allows us to move forward.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
