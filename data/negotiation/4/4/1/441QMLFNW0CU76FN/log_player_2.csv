Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet your price of $1,275,000. I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,285,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly on her price, her final offer of $1,285,000 is still higher than my budget of $1,200,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, as she has stated it's her final offer. I'm better off buying from John at my maximum budget."
