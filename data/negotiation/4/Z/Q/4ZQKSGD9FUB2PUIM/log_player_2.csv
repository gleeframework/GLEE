"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save money. While $11,250 is a better offer than the original $11,000, it's still more than Bob's desired price. There's room for further negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your goal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $11,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what John is selling it for. It's unlikely that Bob will get a better offer from Alice at this point, so it's time to accept."
