"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a limited time. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to start with a price of $950000, considering its value to you. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $950000. Can we meet in the middle?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm afraid the product's value to me is higher than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more. How about we settle on $875000? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's exceptional quality and uniqueness.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $875000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $825000. Can we discuss further?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're having a productive conversation, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm starting to think that $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession: $825000 is the lowest I can go. If you're still not comfortable with that, I'm open to discussing other options, but I need to make a decision soon.",825000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to meet you at $822500, which is just $1500 above your last offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to start thinking about other buyers. What are your thoughts?",82500.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $822500. I'm willing to make a final offer of $750000, which is the lowest I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",750000.0,Bob,10,
