"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the product's features.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, and  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?  This reflects the product's true worth.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
