"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. It shows my commitment to finding a solution, and I believe it's a fair price considering our mutual goals. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a bit more movement to make this work. Would you consider $1,150,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your initial investment.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still committed to finding a solution, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This represents a significant step forward for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product and our ongoing discussions.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
