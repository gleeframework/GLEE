Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $900,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $920,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above my target of $800,000.  While we've been making progress, the negotiation has taken several rounds, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get her to budge further.  Since I have the option to buy from John at my desired price, I'm going to take that option and avoid further negotiation."
