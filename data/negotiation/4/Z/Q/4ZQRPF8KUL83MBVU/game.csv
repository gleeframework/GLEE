"Alice, your offer is still a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. While $925,000 is getting closer, I'm still only able to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,6,
