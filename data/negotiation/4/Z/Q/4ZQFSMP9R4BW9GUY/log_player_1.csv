Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's a significant profit for me. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more to Bob than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial offer of $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant profit for me.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and saves me the time and risk of continuing to negotiate."
