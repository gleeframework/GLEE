"I'm excited to offer you this valuable product for a great price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to meeting your price, Bob. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
