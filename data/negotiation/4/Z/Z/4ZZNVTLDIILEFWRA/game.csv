"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not quite. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go while still covering my costs.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still having a hard time meeting that number. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
