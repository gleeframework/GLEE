"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
