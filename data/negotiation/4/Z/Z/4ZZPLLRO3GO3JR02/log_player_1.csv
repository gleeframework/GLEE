{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it really useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to potentially increase the price if Bob shows interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop the price to $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
