"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Bob's willingness to bargain.  The target is to find a price somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000, which would be beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's getting closer to his limit. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price.  Buying from John at this point would be a waste of money since Bob's goal is to save as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his offer slightly, showing flexibility while still staying below his maximum price. This keeps the negotiation moving and could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price, but it's getting very close. Bob should try to negotiate a slightly lower price, but he needs to be careful not to risk losing the deal. Buying from John would be a safe option, but Bob is determined to get the best price possible.  A counteroffer could lead to a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit, so he makes a counteroffer that's just below Alice's current price. This shows a willingness to compromise and could lead to a deal. He's confident that Alice will accept this offer, as it's still higher than her own value for the product. It's a risk, but Bob believes the potential savings are worth it."
