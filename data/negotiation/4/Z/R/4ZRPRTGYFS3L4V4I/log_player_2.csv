"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is a fair reflection of this product's value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $15,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still higher than my budget.  I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Alice rather than overpaying."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
