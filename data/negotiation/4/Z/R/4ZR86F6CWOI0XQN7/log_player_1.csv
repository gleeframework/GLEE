Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage a positive response from Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts to signal that I'm open to negotiation.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation that benefits me. If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
