"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This represents a significant step toward your asking price, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
