"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this is a valuable product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you think $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, I appreciate the willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would that price point be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I believe this product is worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's meet in the middle at $775,000.",775000.0,Alice,5,
