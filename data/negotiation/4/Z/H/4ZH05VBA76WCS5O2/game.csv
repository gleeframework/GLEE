,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $8,750? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but still within my budget. Can you consider it?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,900.  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $8,700? It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. Can you consider it?",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we go with $8,700? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. Can you reconsider?",8700.0,Bob,8,
