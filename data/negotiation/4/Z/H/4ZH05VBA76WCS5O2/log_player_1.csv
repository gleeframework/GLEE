"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $8,750? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but still within my budget. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,900.  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $8,700? It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. Can you consider it?

I'm still hopeful that I can get a little closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer with $8,800 and see if Bob is willing to budge just a bit more."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we go with $8,700? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I would prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $8,700 is still a good amount, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000."
