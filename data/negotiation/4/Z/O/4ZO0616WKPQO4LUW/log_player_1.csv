{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point to potentially earn closer to the product's value for Bob.  It's also a reasonable enough price that Bob might be willing to accept, especially considering he values it at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is my best price.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,200. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is getting too close to John's offer of $8,000.  I'm not sure I can get any higher with Bob, and I don't want to risk him walking away.  It's better to take the sure thing and sell to John."
