"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential benefits while remaining within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential ROI warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this adjustment strikes a balance between our positions.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep. I'm firm on $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it represents a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
