"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm behind the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a price of $500000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that your budget is limited, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $700000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I must respectfully decline at $1100000. Considering my needs and budget, I am unable to meet at that price point. However, I am open to discussing further if you could consider bringing the price down closer to my maximum budget of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,6,
