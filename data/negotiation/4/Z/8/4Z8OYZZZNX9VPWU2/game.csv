"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a conversation. However, $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $18000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $14000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $16500. What are your thoughts?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but I have to be honest with you, I'm also considering buying from another seller who is offering the product for $8000. Can we meet at this price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
