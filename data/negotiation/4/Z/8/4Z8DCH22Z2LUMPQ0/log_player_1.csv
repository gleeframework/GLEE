Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $9,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested. 
* **Close to Your Minimum:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're guaranteed to sell it to John for $10,000. This way, you maximize your potential profit."
