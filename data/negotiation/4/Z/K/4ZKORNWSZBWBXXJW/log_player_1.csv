Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential surplus. This price leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still ensuring I get a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product highly. This strategy aims to close the gap and reach an agreement quickly without risking a deal with John."

I'm still holding out for a higher price, as Bob is getting closer to my target. I believe there is still room for negotiation and I want to explore that potential."

I'm counteroffering with $9,400. This is a small compromise from my previous offer but still keeps the price above Bob's last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and incentivize Bob to accept while still ensuring I get a good price."
