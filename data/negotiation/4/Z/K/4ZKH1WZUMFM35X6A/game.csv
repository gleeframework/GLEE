"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the  returns it can generate. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the immense value and benefits you'll be receiving.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
