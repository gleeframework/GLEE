"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know is valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it also allows me to get a good price for it.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options."
