Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John acts as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. Therefore, any price Bob accepts above that is pure profit for Alice.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him ($800,000 value - $950,000 price = -$150,000 potential ""loss"", which is still a better outcome than not buying). 
    * Alice secures a $50,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially allowing Alice to secure an even higher price."
