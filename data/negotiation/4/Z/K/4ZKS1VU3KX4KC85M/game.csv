"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
