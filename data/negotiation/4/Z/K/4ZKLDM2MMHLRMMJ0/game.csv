"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to pay $160, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $170. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,5,
