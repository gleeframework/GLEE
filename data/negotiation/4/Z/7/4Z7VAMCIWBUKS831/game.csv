,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130 right now.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 is my starting price, I could come down to $170 for you. I believe this product is worth every penny and I'm confident you'd agree once you start using it.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and I pay $145? That's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
