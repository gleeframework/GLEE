``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and provides a starting point for a potential deal. I'm also keeping my options open by being aware of John's offer of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to that with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $11,500? This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired value. It's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I'm willing to accept this offer to close the deal."
