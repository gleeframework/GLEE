Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it by saying ""given its value"". This subtly implies that the product is worth a significant amount. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning that you'll list it publicly if Bob declines, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging him to act quickly.

By starting at $20,000, Alice leaves room to potentially negotiate down to a price higher than John's $15,000 offer, while still securing a good profit."
