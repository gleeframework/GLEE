"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my current financial situation, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $500000 to $700000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for considering the product, Bob. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid $600000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $900000 is closer to what I can afford, I still feel it might be a bit high. Could we perhaps aim for $750000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget constraints. Based on our discussions, I believe $850000 is a reasonable midpoint. However, if possible, could we consider $800000? I'm hopeful this would allow us to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
