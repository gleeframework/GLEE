"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I can see you're firm on $85, and I respect that.  I can go as high as $80, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",80.0,Bob,6,
