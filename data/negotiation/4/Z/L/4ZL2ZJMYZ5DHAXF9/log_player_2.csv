"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and push you towards the higher price. 
* You have a better alternative: buying from John at $12,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John at your set maximum price."
