"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a low offer ($100) to give myself room to negotiate upwards.  This strategy aims to understand Alice's lower limit.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a positive negotiation tone but also directly states that the initial price is too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your interest!  I understand $200 is a bit high, so how about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down a bit, $170 is still significantly higher than both your $120 maximum and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to get the price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $110?  That's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but staying well below her price and just above John's offer. This signals a willingness to compromise but also sets a firm limit.
* **Market Value Mention:** By mentioning ""market value,"" we're subtly reminding Alice that other options might be available. 
* **Goal in Sight:** We're getting closer to our target price, and further negotiation could lead to a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counter. I'm willing to move a little closer to your price, but $110 is too low.  How about $140? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer & Over Budget:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, and $140 is still above your $120 maximum budget. 
* **John's Offer is Better:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120, saving you $20 compared to Alice's final offer. 

At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay. It's time to take John's offer."
