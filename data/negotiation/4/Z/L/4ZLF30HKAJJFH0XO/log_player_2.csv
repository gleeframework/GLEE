The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90. I can do better than that. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is not budging.  I've made several counteroffers, but she's pushing the price higher.  With only three rounds left, I don't want to risk being stuck with a higher price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
