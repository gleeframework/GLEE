"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still more than I had hoped to spend. Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair offer considering your initial price and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $9,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,,
