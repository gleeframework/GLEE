Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $16,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $16,000, it implies there's value beyond Bob's initial assessment. This could be due to features, future potential, or other factors.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message keeps the door open for negotiation. This is crucial because it shows flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Factors like your relationship with Bob, your negotiation style, and the nature of the product could influence your approach."
