"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects its worth while still making it a worthwhile investment for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on $1,150,000? I feel that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept anything less than $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
