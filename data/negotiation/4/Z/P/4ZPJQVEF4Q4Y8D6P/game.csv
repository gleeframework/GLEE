"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $850,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a competitive price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $725,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a suitable price. It seems we're getting closer. While $725,000 is still a bit below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price if you can guarantee a swift and smooth transaction.",725000.0,Alice,5,
