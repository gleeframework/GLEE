Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to him while still being above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low for me. While I would like to continue negotiating, I'm concerned that we're not getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm confident it's the best outcome for me at this point."
