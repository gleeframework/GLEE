"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could you consider $12,500?  That's a significant increase from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. But $12,500 is still too far off from what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $14,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this negotiation is taking a while!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but we are getting closer. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to move a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but $13,250 just won't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop my price to $13,500. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to come down a little more.  How about $13,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to sell to John for $15,000 than risk getting nothing from Bob."
