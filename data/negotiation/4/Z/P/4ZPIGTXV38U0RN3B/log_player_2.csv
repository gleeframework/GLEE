"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm confident it's worth even more to you. I'm willing to sell it for $1200000.  This is a price that reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price.
* **You are still saving money:**  Even though Alice's offer is more than the product is worth to her ($800,000), it's still significantly less than what you would pay John. 

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
