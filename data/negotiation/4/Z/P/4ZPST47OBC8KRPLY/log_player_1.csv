"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and leaves room for you to profit significantly.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe Bob is willing to go higher, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still allows for a good profit margin for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a good compromise that still allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is showing a willingness to compromise. Accepting his offer at $875,000 guarantees a profit significantly higher than selling to John.  With only six rounds left, it's a good strategy to secure a solid deal rather than risking a lower price or a deal falling through."
