"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $12,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and my investment in it.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth and my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
