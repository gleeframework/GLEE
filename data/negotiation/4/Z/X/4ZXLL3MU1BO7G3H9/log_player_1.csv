Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a chance to acquire it at a discount compared to its true worth to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to accept. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
