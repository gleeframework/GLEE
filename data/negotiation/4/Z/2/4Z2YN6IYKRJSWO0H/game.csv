"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than its estimated value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
