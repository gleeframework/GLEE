Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $80. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John.

Therefore, I start with a strong offer of $140. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  It's unlikely Bob will pay significantly more than his perceived value of $80, but there's a chance he might be willing to go a bit higher if he's interested. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm not losing anything, as I'll sell to John at my desired minimum."
