"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

You can still try to negotiate a lower price. You value the product at $15,000, and Alice values it at $10,000, so there's room for both of you to find a price that works."
