"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth while also being fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm unable to accept $950,000.  It's simply too far below my asking price. Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my absolute limit, but I believe it's a fair price given the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
