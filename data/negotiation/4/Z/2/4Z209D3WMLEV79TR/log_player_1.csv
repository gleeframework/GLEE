"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth while also being fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price. Additionally, I can always sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm unable to accept $950,000.  It's simply too far below my asking price. Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my absolute limit, but I believe it's a fair price given the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly what the product is worth to him, meaning we've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.  While I'd prefer my initial asking price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely. It's also a good strategy to accept a ""fair"" offer when it aligns with the product's perceived value, rather than risking further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
