"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I have 8 rounds left and can potentially negotiate a better price with Bob. Selling to John for $10,000 would be a guaranteed profit, but I believe there's room for improvement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you placed on the product. Let's close this deal, I'm confident it will be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This price allows us both to get a fair deal and close this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $10,750 is still below my target. I have 6 rounds left and can potentially negotiate a better price.  There's a good chance we can reach an agreement within those remaining rounds. Selling to John right now would guarantee me $10,000, but I'm not willing to give up the chance to potentially earn more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,875. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10875}
