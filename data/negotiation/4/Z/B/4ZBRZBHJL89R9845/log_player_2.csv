```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you placed on the product. Let's close this deal, I'm confident it will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This price allows us both to get a fair deal and close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,875. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Offer:** $10,875
* **Value to Bob:** $12,000
* **Value to Alice:** $10,000 
* **Alternative:** Buy from John for $12,000

While Bob can technically keep negotiating, the deal is getting closer to his desired price point.  Accepting the offer:

* Saves Bob $1,125 compared to buying from John.
* Gets Bob a decent deal while still allowing Alice to make a profit.

It's a win-win situation that secures the product for Bob without taking unnecessary risks or wasting more negotiation rounds."
