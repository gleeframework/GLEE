"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is cheaper than buying from John, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer. You're willing to pay up to $100, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
