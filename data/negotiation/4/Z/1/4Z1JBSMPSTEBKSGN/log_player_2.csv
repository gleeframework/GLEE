"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to me, I'm proposing a price of $120 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is better than Alice's initial value of $150, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will come down closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it,  given my budget constraints. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $95 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to sell the product for $93. This is the highest price I can lower it to while still maintaining a reasonable profit for myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer, $93 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  It's better to buy from John at this point as it's a guaranteed price that fits within Bob's budget, even if it means potentially missing out on a slightly better deal if Bob had continued negotiating with Alice."
