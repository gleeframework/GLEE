Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to make sure he knows the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still holding firm on the value of the product.  Hopefully, this will be enough to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,700,000 is still a good amount and significantly better than selling to John.  It's time to finalize the deal and move on."
