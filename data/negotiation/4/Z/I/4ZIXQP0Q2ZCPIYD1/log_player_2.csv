"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer is too expensive.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Bob is going to start with a bold counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, and gives some room for negotiation. It's important to note that this is just the starting point, and Bob is prepared to adjust based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his maximum price, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives Bob a chance to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

Bob is going to increase his offer to $1,450,000. This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, and is still under his maximum price of $1,500,000. He's hoping that this shows he's serious about buying the product, but is still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he's willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, Alice's offer is only $50,000 higher.  It's likely that any further negotiation will only result in a small decrease in price, and could risk Alice walking away from the deal.  Therefore, accepting her offer is the best strategy to secure the product for a price close to his maximum."
