Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  The price of $100 is significantly more than your minimum acceptable price ($80) and still offers a good deal to Bob (who values it at $120).  
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John who will buy the product for $80, ensuring you won't be left with nothing if Bob declines."
