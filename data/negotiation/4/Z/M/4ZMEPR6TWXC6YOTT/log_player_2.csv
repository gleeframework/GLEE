"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left to work with, and the option to buy from John is always available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price is too high. This should encourage Alice to come down on her price, especially since she has a higher valuation for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Bob has several rounds left and can continue to negotiate, potentially reaching a more favorable price.  The option to buy from John is a safe fallback, but Bob should continue to try and get the best possible deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's offer, and it might be tempting for Alice to accept. However, it's still below her desired price, and Bob still has room to negotiate if she rejects the offer. This strategy aims to push the negotiations towards a mutually agreeable price without rushing into an unfavorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high. Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise, but he should continue to push for a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and the option to buy from John is always available if the negotiations stall. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a deal that is more favorable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is again increasing his offer, showing his willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is very close to Alice's latest offer, and it might be tempting for Alice to accept. However, Bob is trying to split the difference, which would be a good outcome for both parties. This counteroffer is a good way to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to come down just a bit more.  If she rejects, Bob can still choose to buy from John for a lower price, but he's getting closer to a deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer.  With only three rounds left, Bob should continue to negotiate, but he needs to be more strategic. He needs to push for a lower price while also considering the risk of losing the deal entirely. Bob should be prepared to either accept a slightly higher price in the next round or switch to John if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a strong attempt to close the deal. It's significantly closer to Alice's latest offer and shows a genuine willingness to compromise. With only two rounds remaining, it's a calculated risk. If Alice accepts, Bob secures a favorable price. If she rejects, he has one more round to decide if he's willing to take the risk of buying from John or increasing his offer even further. This strategy aims to push Alice to accept the deal while still having a backup option if the negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but with only one round remaining, Bob needs to make a choice. While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  With only one round left, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer.  Buying from John guarantees a lower price and a successful deal.  Although Bob would have liked to close the deal with Alice, it's more prudent to take the guaranteed lower price from John and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
