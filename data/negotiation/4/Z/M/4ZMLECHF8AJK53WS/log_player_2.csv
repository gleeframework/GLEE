This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested!

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price. Even though you don't know Alice's true valuation, you can still save $150,000 by accepting her offer. This is a good deal, even if there is a chance you could get a better price later."
