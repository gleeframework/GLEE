I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than my desired profit. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's a small increase. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's so far below my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $10,000.  While this is still above Bob's offer, I believe it's a reasonable price that demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I've already made several concessions and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations. Rather than continuing to negotiate and risk losing even more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my desired profit and ensures a quick and successful transaction."
