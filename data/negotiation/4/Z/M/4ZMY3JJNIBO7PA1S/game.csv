,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is substantial, and $850,000 undervalues its potential.  Would you consider $900,000? It's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. This is my final offer.",875000.0,Bob,4,
