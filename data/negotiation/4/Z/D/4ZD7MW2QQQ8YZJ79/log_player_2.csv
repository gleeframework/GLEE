It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm starting with a relatively low counteroffer to see how Alice responds.  This will gauge her flexibility and hopefully push her toward a more reasonable price."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay from John. I will continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, but staying below the price I'm willing to pay from John.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not going to overpay."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price."

I'm offering Alice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is the same price John is offering.  This is a final attempt to secure the product from Alice at my target price.  If she rejects, I'll move on to John."
