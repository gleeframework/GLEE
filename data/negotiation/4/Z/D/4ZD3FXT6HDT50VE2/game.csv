"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer, so how about $8,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.",8000.0,Bob,6,
