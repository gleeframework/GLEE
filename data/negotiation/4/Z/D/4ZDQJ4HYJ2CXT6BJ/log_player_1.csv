Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to give you negotiating room.
    * Still lower than your guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000), ensuring a profit.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers incentivizes Bob to act quickly and consider your offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your absolute bottom line is $1,200,000."
