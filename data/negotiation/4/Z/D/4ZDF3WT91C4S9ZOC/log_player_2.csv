Round 3

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  She's made it clear this is her ""last compromise."" While we might be able to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more in further rounds, the risk outweighs the potential reward. 

* **Time pressure:** We only have a few rounds left. 
* **Difference is small:** The difference between her offer ($10,250) and our target ($9,500) is relatively small. 
* **John is a fallback:** We always have the option of buying from John for $15,000.

It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now than risk losing it and having to settle for John's much higher price."
