"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a truly unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your need for a profit, $1000000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $850000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement on this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $850000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
