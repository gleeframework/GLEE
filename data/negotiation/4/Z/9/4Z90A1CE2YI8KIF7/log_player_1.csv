{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John acts as your safety net, ensuring you'll at least get $100.

By offering the product at $140, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** You aim to capture as much of the difference between Bob's valuation ($150) and your minimum ($100) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you've started high, there's a chance Bob might negotiate for a slightly lower price, and you can still settle above your minimum. 
* **Avoiding a Lost Sale:** If you start too high (close to $150), Bob might reject the offer outright. This strategy balances getting the best price with ensuring a sale."
