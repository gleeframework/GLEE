Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This gives her leverage to start with a significantly higher offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer of $19,000 gives room for Bob to negotiate.  Even if Bob counter-offers, Alice is likely to secure a price well above her minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value, which can make Bob more inclined to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** While not provided in the prompt, knowing the typical market price for similar products would help Alice refine her offer. 
* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is particularly price-sensitive, she might adjust her initial offer slightly lower, though still above $12,000."
