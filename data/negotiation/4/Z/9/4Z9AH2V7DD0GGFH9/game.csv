"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  This price is fair given the value I place on it and allows for a reasonable profit for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it and the value you've mentioned it has to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to offer $8750 for the product. This is a strong offer that gives you a good return and allows me to stay within my financial constraints.  Let's close the deal at this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $8750 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on it.",8900.0,Alice,5,
