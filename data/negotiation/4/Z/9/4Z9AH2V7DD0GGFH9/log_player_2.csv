"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's aiming for a price closer to $8,000, and Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This price is fair given the value I place on it and allows for a reasonable profit for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it and the value you've mentioned it has to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, $9,000 is still too high. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to offer $8,750 for the product. This is a strong offer that gives you a good return and allows me to stay within my financial constraints.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $8750 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he would prefer a lower price, $8,900 is a good deal given his budget and Alice's resistance to go lower. It's better to secure the product at a price that's only slightly above his target than risk having Alice reject his next counteroffer or potentially buying from John for $8,000 without knowing if he could have gotten a better deal from Alice."
