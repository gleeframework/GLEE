"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $18,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's not worth accepting this offer.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with his maximum budget, hoping to get a quick deal. If Alice rejects, there's room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, especially since she's willing to meet in the middle. Bob should reject and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,000?  This feels like a good middle ground, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, moving closer to Alice's price but still maintaining a margin. This approach shows he's serious about buying the product while pushing for the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. It's a slight increase, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget, and while it's not ideal, it's a good compromise. Bob can likely get a lower price with further negotiation, but the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John for $12,000.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget and avoiding the risk of losing the deal."
