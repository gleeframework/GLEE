Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $120 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not going to risk getting stuck at a lower price.  I'll sell to John for $150, which is my minimum threshold."
