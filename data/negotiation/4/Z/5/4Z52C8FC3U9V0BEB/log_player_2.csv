Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still unwilling to drop her price to your maximum budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $80.  This ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice that might not lead to a successful outcome."
