"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $8,000.
* You have a better alternative in John who is selling the product for your desired price.  
* It's worth negotiating with Alice, as you might be able to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her. 
* I'm hoping to strike a deal closer to my desired price point of $8,000. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can continue to negotiate or  simply purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $8,500 is within my budget, but it's still higher than my desired price. 
* However, it's only $500 more than John's offer, and it's possible that I could get a better deal with further negotiation. 
* However, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, or Alice might offer a price even higher than $8,500.
* Considering the potential time and effort of further negotiation, I'm choosing to accept Alice's offer."
