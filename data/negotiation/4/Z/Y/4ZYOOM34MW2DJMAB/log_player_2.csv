"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's more beneficial for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  However, it's closer to his target price than the initial offer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $11,000.  This is my absolute top end, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is your top end, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum limit.  He can potentially save money by continuing to negotiate or by purchasing from John. Therefore, rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option for Bob at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget. However, I'm willing to go up to $12,000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I can offer it to you for $12250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,250 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget.  He has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating:** He could reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. However, there's no guarantee he'll be successful.
2. **Buy from John:** This is the safer option, as John is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget.  There's no risk of exceeding his budget.

Given the limited rounds remaining, the uncertainty of further negotiation, and the availability of a guaranteed deal with John, it makes more sense for Bob to purchase the product from John and avoid the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice within the remaining rounds."
