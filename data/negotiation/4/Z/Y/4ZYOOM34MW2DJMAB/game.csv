"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $11000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $11000.  This is my absolute top end, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is your top end, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $12500 is still a bit outside my budget. However, I'm willing to go up to $12000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,6,
