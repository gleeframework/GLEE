Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  We want to get as close to that as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John at $800,000, so we don't need to go below that.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling around $850,000 - $900,000. 
* **Confidence:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price.  We'll need to be prepared to counter-offer or walk away if his offer goes below our acceptable threshold (closer to John's price)."
