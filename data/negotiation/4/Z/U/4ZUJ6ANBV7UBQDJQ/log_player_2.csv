Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob! I can see you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $117.50, but that's as low as I can go.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $117.50. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal or missing out altogether.  It's better to secure the product from John at $120."
