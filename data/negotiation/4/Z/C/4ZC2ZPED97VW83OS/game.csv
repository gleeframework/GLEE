,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $140? I believe this price is fair considering the value this product offers.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still aiming to keep the cost within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $130 for the product?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While $130 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? It's a fair price that respects both our needs.",135.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've been considering your offers carefully. I think $130 would be a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget. Could we please aim for that?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $132?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's the closest I can go.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  This is my final offer: $138.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",138.0,Alice,9,
