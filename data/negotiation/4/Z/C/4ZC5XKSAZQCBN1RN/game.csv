"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $120? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $100, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,5,
