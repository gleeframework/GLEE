"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so it makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a much better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and keeps the tone positive.
* **Ambitious but not unreasonable:** Starting low gives you room to negotiate upwards, but it's not so low that it's likely to offend Alice.
* **Clear about your budget:** While you don't explicitly state your $100 maximum, offering $80 signals that you're looking for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $120? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still too high. You're aiming for $100 or less, and you have the backup option of John.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stay closer to $100.  Would you be willing to go any lower than $120?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counter-offer:

* **Acknowledge progress:** Thanking Alice for coming down keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Firm but fair:**  You're stating your desired price range clearly.
* **Slight wiggle room:** Offering $100 leaves a tiny bit of space for Alice to counter if she's REALLY hoping for a bit more, but also signals that you're getting close to your walk-away point (buying from John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $100, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $110, which is still above your target price and what John is offering. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you've already negotiated a decent amount.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid potentially wasting more time with further haggling."
