"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the true worth of this product and the substantial benefits you'll reap.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,225,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, demonstrating my eagerness to close this deal with you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
