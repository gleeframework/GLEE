"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $150. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price. There's no downside to rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $150 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant drop in price. This shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product but are also willing to negotiate. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'd like to meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of $135 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good deal for Bob. While he could continue negotiating, there is a risk Alice will refuse further offers, or that he will run out of rounds. Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product for a good price without risking further negotiation."
