Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) but leaves some room for negotiation as Bob values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I can still try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe there's still room for agreement, given that Bob values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $108 is only slightly less than my initial offer and still significantly better than selling to John for $100.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would only lead to a lower price or a dead end, so it's best to accept this offer."
