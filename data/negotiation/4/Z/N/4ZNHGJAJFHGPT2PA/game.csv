"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,600,000. I understand it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  This is a one-time chance, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay $1,500,000.  Let me know if you're interested in proceeding.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
