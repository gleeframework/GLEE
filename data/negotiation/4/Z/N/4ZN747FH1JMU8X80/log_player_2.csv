"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I want to start with a strong opening offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** While our goal is to get the product as cheap as possible, we know John offers it for $1,200,000.  Therefore, we need to make counteroffers with that price ceiling in mind.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is essential."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our ideal price.  There's no point in further negotiation or going with John, as we won't get a better deal."
