This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice is signaling that this is close to her absolute minimum.  Continuing to push could make her less willing to negotiate. 
* **Significant Savings:** You've already negotiated the price down significantly from $950,000 to $790,000. That's a substantial saving.
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing to haggle for a slightly better deal might not be worth the time and effort, especially since you're nearing your walk-away point."
