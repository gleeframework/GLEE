{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it at $12,000. This leaves a significant margin for negotiation.
* **Potential for better price:** You have 10 rounds and can make counteroffers. It's likely you can get a lower price.
* **Avoiding John's high price:** Buying from John is a last resort, as he offers the highest price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness in getting a good deal. It's still higher than the product's worth to Alice, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she rejects, you can adjust your strategy in the following rounds."
