"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to be closer to $115 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $110? ",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $108?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $108 is still a bit low for me.  How about we compromise at $112? It's a fair midpoint between our last offers.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable going above $108, and I think $112 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $112, which is $110, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you accept $110?",110.0,Bob,6,
