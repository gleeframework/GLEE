"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250. Can you consider that?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $13,750. This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while also letting you get a great deal. What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a reasonable profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,500 still falls short of what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Time is running out, so let's try to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,700, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13700.0,Bob,8,
