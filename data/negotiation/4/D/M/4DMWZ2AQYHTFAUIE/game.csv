"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  To be honest, $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I could do $875,000. Would that work for you?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $875,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $920,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm willing to move a little bit. How about $890,000?",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move, Bob. However, $890,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $915,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can do $900,000, but that's as high as I can go.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not sure it's enough. I'm willing to make one more compromise. Let's try $910,000. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the sale.",910000.0,Alice,9,
