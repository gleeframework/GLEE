Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for a price close to the middle ground between our perceived values. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive message helps establish a rapport and might make Bob more receptive to my offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going all-in with my first offer, leaving space for counteroffers and a potential compromise. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I want a better price than John's $8,000, this offer still leaves me with a comfortable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,500 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my target price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to compromise but not at this price point yet. 
* **Taking control:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain control of the negotiation and make a counteroffer that reflects my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,500 is a bit low for me, considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,500? This way, we both get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer outright, but I'm also not rejecting him entirely. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Middle ground:**  My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500), making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Positive language:** I use phrases like ""good deal"" and ""appreciate your interest"" to maintain a positive tone and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm coming down in price, I'm not giving away too much. This keeps the pressure on Bob to either accept my offer or risk losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This means I'm securing a decent profit.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate risks him walking away entirely.  There's a chance he might find another seller, or simply lose interest.
* **Limited bargaining power:**  At this point, I've already made several concessions. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly higher price from Bob. 

**Conclusion:** It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
