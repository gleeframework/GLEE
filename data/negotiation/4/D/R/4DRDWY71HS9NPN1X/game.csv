"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? ",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $1,350,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
