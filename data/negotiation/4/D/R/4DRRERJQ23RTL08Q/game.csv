"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,750? It's still above your value and closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further to $10,900.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
