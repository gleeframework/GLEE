Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this approach is strategic:

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting high ($14,000) leaves room for negotiation while staying close to Bob's perceived value.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""incredibly valuable to you"") reinforces his potential gain.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Creating a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secured buyer (John) at $10,000, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's willingness to pay and your fallback option."
