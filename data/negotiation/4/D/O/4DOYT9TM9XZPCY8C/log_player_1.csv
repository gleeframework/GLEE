Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $115 is a bit out of my price range.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $115.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $110?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference -  how about $107.50? That's a fair compromise and would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally prefer $110, Bob's offer of $107.50 is a good compromise.  It's higher than selling to John and gets us closer to the middle ground.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
