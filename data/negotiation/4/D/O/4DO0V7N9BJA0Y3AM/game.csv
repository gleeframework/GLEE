"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. How about we aim for a price that reflects its worth to both of us? Would you consider $95 for the product?",95.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your budgetary constraints. To find common ground, how about we aim for a price closer to my valuation while still being reasonable for you? Would $90 be within your consideration range?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find common ground, but I'm still a bit above $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we aim for $87.50? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your feedback and aiming for a mutually beneficial solution, how about we set the price at $89 for the product? This is slightly higher than your last offer, reflecting the product's value.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $89. How about we meet in the middle at $88? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stick to my budget.",88.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $88.50. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we aim for $87.50? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. How about we settle on $86? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",86.0,Bob,10,
