Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  If Bob rejects, we can negotiate. I'll be prepared to lower the price somewhat, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my initial asking price, but it's still not quite where I want it to be. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer to my previous one. It's still a good profit for me and hopefully, it will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a considerable drop from my previous offer, but I'm still holding out for a decent profit. It's a risk, but I believe this could be the last counteroffer I make before accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000 for this product. I'll take John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit."
