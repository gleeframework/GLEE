"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial asking price.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,020,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still stuck at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
