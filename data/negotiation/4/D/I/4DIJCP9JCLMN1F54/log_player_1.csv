Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $15,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too high:**  You don't want to scare Bob off with an unrealistic price. 
* **It's accompanied by a friendly message:** This helps to build rapport and encourages Bob to consider your offer.

Keep in mind that this is just the first step. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your assessment of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, it's still worth exploring if you can get a higher price. You have no idea how much the product is worth to him, and he might be willing to go higher. By rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Midpoint:**  $13,500 is the midpoint between your last offer and Bob's offer, which is often a good starting point for compromise.
* **Positive Language:** The message focuses on a positive outcome and emphasizes the fairness of the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** While there's always a chance Bob might go higher, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer.
* **Time and risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer and potentially ending up with John's offer of $12,000.

Accepting Bob's offer of $12,800 is a reasonable decision, as it's only slightly below your minimum and secures a sale."
