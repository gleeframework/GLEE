"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $800,000 is still a significant amount of money, and he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's no reason to rush into a deal when he has the option to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save more, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $750,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to get a slightly lower price with more negotiation, it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  $750,000 is a significant savings over John's price, and it's worth accepting to avoid potentially lengthy negotiations and the risk of Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
