"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save more, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $750,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",750000.0,Alice,3,
