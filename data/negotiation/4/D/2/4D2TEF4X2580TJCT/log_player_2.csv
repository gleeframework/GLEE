```

I'm going all in with my final offer of $10,000. This is my absolute maximum budget, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it.  If she rejects, I'll have no choice but to buy from John in the next round. However, I'm optimistic that Alice will recognize the value in closing the deal, given the significant progress we've made in negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge from her price, and I've already offered my absolute maximum. The negotiation is at an impasse, and there's a high risk that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John for $10,000, ensuring I get the product while staying within my budget."
