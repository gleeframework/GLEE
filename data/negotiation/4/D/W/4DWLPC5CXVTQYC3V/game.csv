,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9500 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's a significant step closer to meeting your needs. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers,  but I can't go any lower than $9625. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let me know if you're willing to come up to this price.",9625.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9625. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9300. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9300.0,Bob,8,
