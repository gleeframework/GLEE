Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 3

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers,  but I can't go any lower than $9,625.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9625. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9300. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and while Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offers are still below my target. With only two rounds left, I don't have time to negotiate further. To avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely, I will sell to John, guaranteeing a profit."
