"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  
* **Strategic Margin:**  The price is significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000), giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **First Impression:** This opening offer establishes my value proposition and sets the tone for the negotiation. 

**Important Notes:**

* I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm starting with a high offer to maximize potential profit.
* The decision to accept or reject Bob's counteroffers will be based on my assessment of his willingness to pay and my remaining time to close the deal.
* I'm aware of the John option, which provides a safety net and will be considered throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Not a Final Deal:**  I believe I can potentially get a better price, especially with 8 rounds remaining.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control and counter with a higher price, keeping the pressure on Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time:**  I have 8 rounds to close the deal, so I can afford to be selective and wait for a more favorable offer.
* **Value:**  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,200,000, so I'm not eager to settle for that price.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still mindful of John's $1,000,000 offer, which serves as a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000, aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer of $1,350,000 splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  This price is still significantly above my minimum value, but it demonstrates a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Strategic Value:**  By meeting Bob halfway, I hope to entice him to accept the offer, saving time and potentially maximizing my profits.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balance:**  I want to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and avoiding a stalemate. 
* **Progress:**  This counteroffer demonstrates progress and encourages further negotiations. 
* **Time:** I have 7 rounds left, but I want to reach a deal quickly to avoid the risk of John's offer becoming more appealing. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and my remaining time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Progress:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer ($1,200,000), showing his willingness to negotiate.
* **Time Pressure:** We're already in Round 4, and time is running out. I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to accept John's lower offer.
* **Profitability:**  While $1,250,000 is still below my initial goal, it's significantly higher than John's offer and a decent profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balance:**  The offer is a reasonable compromise, and I'm comfortable with the price.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of further negotiations leading to a stalemate or a worse outcome. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  I'm willing to accept this offer because the potential loss from further negotiations outweighs the chance of a slightly higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to finalize the deal with Bob and secure the $1,250,000 profit."
