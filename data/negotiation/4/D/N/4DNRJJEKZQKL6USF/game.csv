"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is below the minimum I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
