"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for us both. This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and aspirations, is priced at $1,200,000. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I believe this is a fair and advantageous proposition for you to consider. I look forward to discussing the details and exploring how we can make this transaction beneficial for all parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John.  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and John will sell it to you at that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you set yourself up to save $200,000."
