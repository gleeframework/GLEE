"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $10500 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and I pay $9750?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer it to you for $10250. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there.  $10250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $9900.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",9900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9900. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10100. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",10100.0,Alice,7,
