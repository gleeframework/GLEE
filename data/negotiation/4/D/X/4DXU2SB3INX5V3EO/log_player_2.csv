"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is still quite high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives room for bargaining and compromise.
* **Significant Difference:** A $300,000 difference from Alice's initial offer shows I'm serious about getting a better price while still being within a reasonable range of her valuation. 
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'd like to propose $1,250,000 as a compromise. This still leaves room for a good profit for you and allows me to achieve a better price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While $1,250,000 is better, it's still above my ideal price range. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** Rejecting this offer encourages Alice to move closer to the middle ground. I'll aim for a price closer to $1,150,000 in the next round."

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($1,250,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,100,000).
* **Reaching a Fair Deal:** $1,150,000 represents a good compromise. Alice gets a price significantly above her valuation, and I stay well below my maximum budget.
