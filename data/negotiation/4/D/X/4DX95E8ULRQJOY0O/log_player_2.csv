"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, you're still looking to save as much as you can. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,125,000. I think that's a fair price for this valuable product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've already negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer, and $1,125,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $1,500,000. It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to small changes, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you keep rejecting offers."
