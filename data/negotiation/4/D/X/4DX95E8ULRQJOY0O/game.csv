"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to work with you. I'm still a bit higher than $1,000,000, though. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,125,000. I think that's a fair price for this valuable product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
