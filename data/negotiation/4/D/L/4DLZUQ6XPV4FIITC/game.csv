"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider my own needs as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1250000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price.

"I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I've made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1320000. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. I'm now offering the product to you for $1320000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll take it.",1320000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're making one final offer, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm still not comfortable paying $1320000. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other options. I'm willing to walk away from this deal and buy the product from John for $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
