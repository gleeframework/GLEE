I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer is the best option to ensure I don't lose money."
