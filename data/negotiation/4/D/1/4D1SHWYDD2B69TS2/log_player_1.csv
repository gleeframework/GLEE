I'm starting with a price that is $100,000 higher than the product's worth to Bob.  This is a strong opening offer, giving me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  However, I'm also prepared to accept the $800,000 price from John if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is $50,000 higher than John's offer. It's a good deal for me."
