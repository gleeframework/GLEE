"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product. While Alice's offer of $100 is better than John's price of $120, you can still do better. By rejecting her offer, you force Alice to potentially lower her price to secure the sale."
