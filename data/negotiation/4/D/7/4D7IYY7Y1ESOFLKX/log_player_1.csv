Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down slightly. Would you consider $1,375,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet the price at $1,375,000. Would it be possible to negotiate further down to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation going further down or losing Bob as a buyer."
