Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to stick to my budget of $100 if possible. Could you possibly meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob seems firm on his $100 offer. I've already gone down from $150 to $125 and Bob hasn't budged.  Rather than risk going back and forth for another 6 rounds, I'm going to sell to John for $100. It's not ideal, but it guarantees me at least my minimum and saves time."
