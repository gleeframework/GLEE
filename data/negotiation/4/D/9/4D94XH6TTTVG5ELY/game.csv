"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $10,250 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
