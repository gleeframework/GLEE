"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, she has a higher price point in mind than just breaking even.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is close, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both parties, considering your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and Alice's desire to get at least $1,000,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a favorable price without risking further negotiation."
