"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $1,000,000 is a significant price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob while also highlighting a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before reaching John's offer, giving me more flexibility to explore a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000,  $850,000 is still a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for further negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss. I want to explore if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Reiterate value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the price.
* **Setting a reasonable expectation:** The counteroffer is within a realistic range, leaving room for a few more rounds of negotiation if necessary. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While I'm compromising, I'm not giving away too much, making sure I still get a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $900,000 is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still rounds left in the negotiation.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Avoiding a significant loss:**  While $900,000 is better than $850,000, accepting it would still mean a significant loss for me.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $925,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  I'm offering a smaller compromise this time, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to give in too much.
* **Highlighting value:**  I continue to emphasize the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Focusing on a middle ground:**  The message frames the offer as a middle ground between our positions, increasing the chances of acceptance. 
* **Staying close to my goal:** $925,000 is closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for a few more rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $920,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm only in round 6, and there are still four rounds left. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding a significant loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss for me. I'm willing to risk another round or two to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $920,000.  However, I need to make sure I'm compensated fairly for this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $922,500. This is a very small step from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both recognize in the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 922500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  A small compromise shows flexibility while maintaining a firm stance. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The offer emphasizes finding a middle ground to encourage acceptance.
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message reinforces the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Pushing for a Close:**  With only a few rounds left, this offer might be enough to get Bob to accept.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  If Bob rejects, I still have rounds left to negotiate further, or I can sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $922,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $918,000 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $918,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $918,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 8, and only two rounds left. 
* **Negotiations stalled:** Bob's offer is still far from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of further losses:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further concessions, potentially resulting in a lower price than John's offer.
* **Guaranteeing a good deal:**  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a much better outcome than risking further losses with Bob.

While I'd prefer to negotiate a higher price with Bob, the limited time and risk of further concessions make selling to John the most logical choice at this point."
