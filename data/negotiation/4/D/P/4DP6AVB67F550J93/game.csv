"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I'm hoping to keep the price closer to my maximum budget. I would like to propose a price of $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $750,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. I'm proposing $850,000.  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to recoup some of the value of this unique product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",850000.0,Alice,3,
