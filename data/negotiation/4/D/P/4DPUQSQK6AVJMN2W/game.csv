"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
