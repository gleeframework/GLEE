Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1200000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value of $1000000 and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
