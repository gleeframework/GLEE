Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and my budget.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a competitive advantage."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000.

We're getting closer, but I still think we can do better.  I'm not ready to drop below $1.9 million."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll try one more time to see if I can get him a bit higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,945,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer $1,900,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

While I could push Bob further, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,900,000 is a significant profit, and it avoids the risk of him walking away and having to settle for John's $1,500,000."
