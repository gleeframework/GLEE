"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a steal for its value.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $200 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $170.  I believe this product is well worth it, and you won't find a better offer.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $170 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to look elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $120. Let's meet in the middle at $145. This is my final offer. ",145.0,Alice,5,
