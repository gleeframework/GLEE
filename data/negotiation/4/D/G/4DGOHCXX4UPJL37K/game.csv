"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However,  I'm going to need to come in lower than your asking price.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking that $1,050,000 is still a bit low for the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1,150,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, and I think we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,120,000? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the value this product brings.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
