The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer of $120 is too high. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer of $100 is still too high.  It's better to buy the product from John for $80, which is your maximum price point."
