Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below the product's value to both of us.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on."
