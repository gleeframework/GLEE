Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but $112 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $113.50 for this round.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113.5. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly comfortable making smaller concessions. Accepting at $113.50 is a good deal and avoids the risk of the price going back up or running out of rounds and having to buy from John for $150."
