"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is the same price as John's, there's no incentive to accept her offer. You'll be better off rejecting and buying from John, since that's the same price, but it allows you to potentially negotiate with Alice later."
