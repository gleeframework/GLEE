"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my target price. I know the product is worth that to me, and Bob might be willing to pay a premium to get it. I'm willing to risk going to John if Bob isn't interested in paying my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is far too low, and I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. It's still a good price for Bob, and it's closer to my target price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's a slight improvement, it's still far below my target price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup option with John. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,050,000. This is still significantly more than what Bob offered, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm getting closer to his price range, but still maintaining a price that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. While I would like to reach a deal with Bob, his offers haven't moved much, and I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. Given the risk of running out of rounds and ending up with nothing, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John."
