"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,200. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",15200.0,Bob,4,
