"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a significant value for you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is still significantly above his maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I'm placing on the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, as he's already indicated that he's willing to pay up to $850,000.  There's still room for negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $925,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and the value of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than his desired price point.  Bob should continue to negotiate to try and bring the price down further.  He has a few more rounds to work with before needing to make a decision about John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price considering the value and my budget, and it would allow us to both benefit from the deal.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $910,000 is still not quite meeting my needs. Let's compromise at $915,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is close to his maximum budget, but he should still try to negotiate a lower price.  Alice has come down considerably, but there's still a small margin to work with. Bob should continue to push for a lower price and try to close the deal at $910,000 or a slightly lower amount. He still has a few rounds left before he needs to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $915,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $912,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 912500}
