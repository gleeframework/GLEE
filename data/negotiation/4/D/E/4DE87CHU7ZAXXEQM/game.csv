"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my ideal price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay.  Let's meet in the middle!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $900000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
