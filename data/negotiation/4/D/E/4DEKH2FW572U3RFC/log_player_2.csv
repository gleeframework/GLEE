"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a product worth $1,500,000 to you at a lower price. I'm confident this is a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:** Even though you're paying more than Alice's value ($1,200,000), you're still getting the product for less than what it's worth to you ($1,500,000)."
