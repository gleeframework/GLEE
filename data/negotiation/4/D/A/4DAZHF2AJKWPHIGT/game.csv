"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this product with me. While I recognize its potential, I'm not quite ready to commit to $950,000.  I'd be willing to consider $700,000, which is still a fair price given its value to you. I'm eager to finalize a deal, so let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering your value for the product. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is a significant offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, which reflects the value of the product to me and acknowledges the concessions you've made. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
