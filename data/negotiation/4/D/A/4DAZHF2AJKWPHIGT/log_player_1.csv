Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this product with me. While I recognize its potential, I'm not quite ready to commit to $950,000.  I'd be willing to consider $700,000, which is still a fair price given its value to you. I'm eager to finalize a deal, so let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
