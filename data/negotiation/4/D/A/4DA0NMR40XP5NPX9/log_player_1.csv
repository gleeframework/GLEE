Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and the investments made in its development. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,100,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While closer to your minimum, Bob's offer is still below what you can likely get. You're aiming for the maximum and have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product, which I believe is closer to $1,075,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my initial price."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

This is a good deal! You're getting $50,000 more than your minimum acceptable price and Bob is clearly motivated to buy.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds."
