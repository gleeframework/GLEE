"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and the investments made in its development. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,100,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product, which I believe is closer to $1,075,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my initial price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
