"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this work.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Let's find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can we compromise on that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as the product is worth this much to me.  Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
