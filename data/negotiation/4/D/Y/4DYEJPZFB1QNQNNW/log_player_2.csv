"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring if we can reach a more agreeable price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Let's start with that number and see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $17,000. This is a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price closer to my limit.  Rejecting allows me to counter and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000.  Let's split the difference and try $12,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
