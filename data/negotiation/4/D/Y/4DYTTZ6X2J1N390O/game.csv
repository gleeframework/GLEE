"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is already a discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
