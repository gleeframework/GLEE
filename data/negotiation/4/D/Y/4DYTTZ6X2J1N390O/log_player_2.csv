Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is already a discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has come down to her minimum price.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower and this price is well below your maximum and John's offer."
