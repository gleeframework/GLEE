Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm still early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $190,  as I think this product is worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 190}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $190 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $185? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $185. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $185
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $200,  $185 is a good price and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. I also want to avoid risking selling to John for $150."
