"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your potential gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for less than $950,000, and it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There is a significant gap between Alice's minimum price ($800,000) and Bob's maximum price ($1,000,000), so there is room for a compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $875,000.  This is a significant discount from your initial offer and still allows for a healthy profit for you."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price. However, $875,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $912,500. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $875,000, and Alice's offer is still above that. While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $950,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue to push for a lower price, potentially finding a middle ground between their desired prices."
