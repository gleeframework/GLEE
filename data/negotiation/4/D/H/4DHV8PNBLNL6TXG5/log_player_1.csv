"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth at least $80 to me, and Bob is offering that amount. It's not ideal, but it's the best I can get at this point."
