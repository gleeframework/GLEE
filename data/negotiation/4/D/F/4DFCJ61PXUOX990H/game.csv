"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $10,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
