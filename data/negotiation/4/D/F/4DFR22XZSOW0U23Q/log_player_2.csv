Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your commitment. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's the best price I can offer, and I hope you can see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $13,500, I'm still hesitant to go that high. It's closer to my budget, but I have a solid backup option with John offering the product at $12,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when I can secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with from John."
