,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me at that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $15000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $17500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $17500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $16250? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",16250.0,Bob,4,
