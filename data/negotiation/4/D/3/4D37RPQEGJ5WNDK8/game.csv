"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we start at $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go to $10,500.  I'm still interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $11,000.  This is a fair price given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $11,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $11,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $11,250, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",11500.0,Alice,7,
