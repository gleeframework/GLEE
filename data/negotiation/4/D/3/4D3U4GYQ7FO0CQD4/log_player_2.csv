"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's room to negotiate.  You're better off rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a better price. You can always buy from John for $800,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $700,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to overpay. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $775,000 is still a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget is $800,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better price.  There's also the risk of Alice getting frustrated and calling off the deal altogether.  

Accepting this offer gives me a good product at a reasonable price and avoids the potential for further negotiation risks."
