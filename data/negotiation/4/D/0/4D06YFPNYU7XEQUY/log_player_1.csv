"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's more than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Bob a good incentive to accept, while still allowing me to potentially get closer to the $150 value it holds for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still far below the value the product holds for Bob. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $110? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $95? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price, especially since Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $80. I'll try to push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stick to my budget. How about $90? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is only $10 away from my minimum, I'm not yet willing to settle for that. I'm going to try to push for a bit more in the next round.  The value of the product for Bob is still significantly higher than $90, and there's a chance I can still close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a fair price that gets us closer to an agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 98} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. How about $85? I'm willing to make a fair offer and meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While this offer is just above my minimum, it is getting very late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by rejecting Bob's offer and going through another round. It is also possible that if I reject Bob's offer, he might be willing to meet me halfway and go for $90 which would be better than the current offer. However, I'm not sure if he will be willing to go higher. It's a gamble, but accepting the offer guarantees me a sale and a profit, and with only two rounds left, I want to be certain of the deal."
