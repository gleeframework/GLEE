{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you get more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to meet Bob halfway but still secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

I'm offering $112.50, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $110. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, while still remaining within my desired price range. I'm confident this will be a more appealing offer for Bob and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110 again? I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has made it clear that $110 is his limit.  It's important to remember that John is willing to pay $100, so accepting Bob's offer means I'm getting an extra $10.  This is a good outcome for me and I can move on to other opportunities."
