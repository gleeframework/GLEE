Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.  
* **Justification:**  Phrasing like ""unique product"" and ""true worth"" subtly emphasizes the value to encourage Bob to meet the high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering it at $2,250,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you will sell to John for $1,500,000. There's no opportunity to counter-offer in this scenario."
