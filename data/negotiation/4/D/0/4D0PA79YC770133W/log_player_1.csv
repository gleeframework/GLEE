Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price.  While it's still higher than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer."

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,300,000,  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'll accept it."
