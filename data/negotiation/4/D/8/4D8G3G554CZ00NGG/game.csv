"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I still think this product is worth a lot. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
