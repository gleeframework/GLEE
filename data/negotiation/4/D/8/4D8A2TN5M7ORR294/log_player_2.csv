(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. You have a good chance of getting a lower price since Alice values the product at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. It's a strong opening move that shows you're serious about getting a good deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for you. While you could potentially negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.  Also, if you reject this offer, Alice might become less willing to negotiate further. It's safer to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that's still within your budget."
