"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a bold opening, but I believe the product is valuable and worth more than my minimum.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and get a sense of his potential price range.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering significantly less than my minimum.  I'm not willing to sell for that price, but I'm also hesitant to sell to John yet. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $850,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still within my minimum price range.  I believe Bob is starting to come closer to my value and I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob and see if I can reach a better deal. I believe there's still room for us to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm now offering my absolute minimum price of $800,000.  This is a final attempt to reach a deal with Bob.  If he rejects this, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for the same price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price. It's time to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
