# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is your maximum price. There's no reason to accept it on the first round.  Rejecting allows for potential negotiation and hopefully a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is at the upper limit of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm confident that this product will bring you a great return on investment. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my initial counteroffer.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, so I'll reject and see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,025,000, but I need to stay within that range. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1025000 and $1050000, which is $1037500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can shake hands on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her offer is only $12,500 above my last counteroffer. It's likely we're close to her bottom line, so accepting saves time and risk.  I can live with this price."
