"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is at the upper limit of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1000000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm confident that this product will bring you a great return on investment. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1050000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1025000, but I need to stay within that range. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1025000 and $1050000, which is $1037500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can shake hands on it.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
