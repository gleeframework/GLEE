"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $7,500 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Could you consider $6,800?  I believe that's a fair price.",6800.0,Bob,4,
