"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $890,000, which is getting closer to my target price of $850,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there are only 5 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal. It's a good price, and I can still save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
