Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a good price, but if Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is far below the value of the product to me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is still a fair bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will be more enticing to Bob while still getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I know John is willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm going to counteroffer once more and see if I can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. If Bob rejects, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
