"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, there's room to bargain and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to Alice's minimum. This initial offer leaves room for negotiation and signals Bob's intention to reach a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and closer to his desired price range. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and secure the product quickly.  Further negotiation might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice further reducing the price isn't worth it at this point."
