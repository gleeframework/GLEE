{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to me. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price that allows me to stay within my financial constraints. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in my product. However, I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there is a chance I could negotiate her down further, the risk of going over my budget and the potential for further rounds of negotiation makes it more efficient to buy the product from John at my target price."
