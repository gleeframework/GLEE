"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to me. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price that allows me to stay within my financial constraints. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in my product. However, I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the value it holds for me.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
