"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling the product. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product, considering its value to me.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1050000 for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1000000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. My revised offer is $1075000 for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm offering $1037500 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1037500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. My revised offer is $1075000 was a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so my new offer is $1062500 for the product.",1062500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm offering $1050000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal, and I'm sure we can both benefit from it.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at a fair price. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1050000 yet. I'm willing to make one final offer that I think will meet both our needs. My revised offer is $1075000 was too high, and $1050000 is a bit too low, so I'm going to meet you at the midpoint of those two numbers, which is $1062500. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $1060000, so my final offer is $1060000 for the product.",1060000.0,Alice,9,
