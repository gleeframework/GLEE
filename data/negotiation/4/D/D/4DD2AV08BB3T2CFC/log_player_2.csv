"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price, aiming to find a middle ground. This move shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value to you is clearly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still more than what the product is worth to Alice.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a price closer to his $10,000 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise, considering our both our positions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 represents a significant move toward Alice's price but still keeps Bob within his budget and closer to his ideal price. This move shows that Bob is serious about closing the deal and encourages Alice to consider a compromise."
