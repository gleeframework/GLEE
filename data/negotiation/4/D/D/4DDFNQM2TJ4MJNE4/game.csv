"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and benefits it offers.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have my limits.  How about we bring it down closer to a more realistic figure?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While your offer is appealing, we're still a ways off from a figure that reflects the true potential of what's being offered. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on its value, but that price is still out of my budget.  I need to be mindful of my spending.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's truly my limit.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your 'final offer' is still a long way from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. This is a fair deal, take it or leave it.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
