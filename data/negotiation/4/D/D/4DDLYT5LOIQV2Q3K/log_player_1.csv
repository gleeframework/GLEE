Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is a significant drop from my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget."",
""product_price"": 18000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, but I'm still unable to meet you at $18,000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $15,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly.  It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds for a potentially small gain. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids further time investment with Bob."
