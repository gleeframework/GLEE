Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $118, but I'm not willing to go any lower. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $118.  At this point, it's more cost-effective to take the guaranteed price of $120 from John rather than risk a stalemate with Alice and potentially lose out on the product entirely."
