Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. To be fair, the product's value is significant, and I'm aiming for a price that reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This seems like a reasonable compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's try $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering both our needs and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need. Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this stage."
