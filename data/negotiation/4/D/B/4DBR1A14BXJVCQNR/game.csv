"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. To be fair, the product's value is significant, and I'm aiming for a price that reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This seems like a reasonable compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's try $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering both our needs and the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
