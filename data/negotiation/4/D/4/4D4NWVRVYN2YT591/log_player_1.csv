Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and you can then decide whether to accept or reject his offer based on how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value of $130. It's worth seeing if I can push Bob a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original price. How about $125? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $125, Bob's offer of $115 is still a good deal. It's better than selling to John for $100, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether.  It's time to accept the offer and finalize the sale."
