{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value Bob will receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $95 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $100 for the product. This is my highest offer, as I am also considering buying from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $120, which is a better deal for me.  I'll take John's offer and avoid further risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffers."
