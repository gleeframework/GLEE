"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. How about we try to get closer to my initial target price? I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",920000.0,Bob,4,
