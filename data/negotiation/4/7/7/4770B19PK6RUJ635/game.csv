"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to me is high, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. Would $1,025,000 be acceptable to you?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
