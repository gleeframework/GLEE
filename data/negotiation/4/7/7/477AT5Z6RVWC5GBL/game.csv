"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given its uniqueness, I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price and reflects the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's rarity and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's uniqueness and the value it can bring to the right buyer, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering $825000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and your budget. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
