"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects its value.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,075,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would $987,500 work for you?",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference again. How about $1,031,250? I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1031250.0,Alice,5,
