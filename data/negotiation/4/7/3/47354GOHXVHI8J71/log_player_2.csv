"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and will be a great asset to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. While her message tries to emphasize value, you know there's room for negotiation. It's better to counter-offer and see if she's willing to come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above your ideal price.  We're getting closer to John's offer, but there's likely room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,075,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would $987,500 work for you?"",
""product_price"": 987500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference again. How about $1,031,250? I believe this represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,031,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,031,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're now in a pattern of splitting the difference, and Alice is very consistently coming down. However, she's still slightly above your guaranteed price with John. One more counteroffer might be enough to get her below $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close! I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we settle this right now at $1,009,375?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
