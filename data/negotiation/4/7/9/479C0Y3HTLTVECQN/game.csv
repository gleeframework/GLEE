"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your starting price is a little high for me. Would you consider selling it for $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,300,000? This is my best counteroffer for now.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,300,000 is still a touch high for me. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1,250,000? This is my final offer for now.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
