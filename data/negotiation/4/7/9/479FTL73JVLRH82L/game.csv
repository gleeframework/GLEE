"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is certainly interesting but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $750,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $800,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $775,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $775,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $790,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",790000.0,Alice,7,
