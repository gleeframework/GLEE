"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident it would be worth at least $1500000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000, a price that reflects its true potential. This is a one-time opportunity, so please let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a lower price.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
