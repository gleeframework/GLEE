"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to its true worth is fair.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
