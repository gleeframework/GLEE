``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiations, I'm confident I can get closer to my target. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $9,750?  That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm not quite ready to accept $9,750.  How about we split the difference at $10,125?  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. "", ""product_price"": 10125}
