"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This item holds immense value to me, but I am confident it would be an exceptional addition to your collection or business. Given its significance and the unique attributes it possesses, I am offering it to you for $950,000. This price reflects its true worth while allowing us both to benefit from this transaction. I trust that you will find this offer compelling and look forward to discussing the details further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,200,000
* **John's price:** $1,200,000

Although Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still within your budget.  However, it's closer to your maximum limit, leaving less room for negotiation. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to lower her price to become more competitive, or you can move forward with John, who is at your maximum price."
