{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's estimated value, but lower than my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a chance to make a counteroffer.  It also shows I'm willing to work with him, while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired range.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and am now able to offer $1,325,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm closer to my minimum acceptable price with Bob's latest offer of $1,325,000, it's still not ideal. It's clear that we are not likely to reach a mutually agreeable price quickly. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, it's more efficient to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation."
