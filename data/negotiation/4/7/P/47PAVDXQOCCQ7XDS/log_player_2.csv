"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Alice's offer is $300,000 below Bob's maximum price. This indicates there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **No immediate pressure:**  There's no indication that the product is in high demand, or that Alice will quickly sell it to someone else.  Bob has time to negotiate.

By rejecting the initial offer, Bob signals that he's willing to negotiate and sets the stage for a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own potential profit. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still a $50,000 gap. This suggests further negotiation is possible.
* **John is still an option:**  Bob has the option to buy from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept an offer that isn't ideal.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own potential profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good time for Bob to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  Accepting the offer saves Bob $225,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Alice has clearly stated this is her lowest price.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Alice withdrawing the offer entirely.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice will stick to her price or find another buyer.  

While it's possible Bob might get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing the deal or ending up with a worse outcome buying from John."
