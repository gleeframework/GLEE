"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to acquire the product at a price closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850000.

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $925000. This price reflects the value of the product to me, and it would allow you to make a good profit.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own potential profit. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,
