"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy it now.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not ready to give up on getting the best price for my product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
