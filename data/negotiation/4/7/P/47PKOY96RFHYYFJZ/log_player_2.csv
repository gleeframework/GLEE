"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to try and get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, we aim to bring the negotiation closer to our desired range.
* **Polite and Open:** The message maintains a polite and interested tone, avoiding any language that might offend Alice and derail the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** While we don't need to provide a specific reason for our counteroffer, the phrase ""a bit too high for me"" subtly implies budget constraints without revealing our absolute limit.

This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal than the initial offer or what's available from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, and while it's not our ideal price, it's only $5 more than John's offer.  

* **Minimal Savings:** Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the potential savings are now minimal compared to the risk of Alice walking away. 
* **Time Value:** Continued negotiation takes time. The small potential savings might not be worth the extra effort.

It's a good deal at $105, and it makes sense to secure the product now."
