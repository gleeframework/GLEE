"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your input and understand your perspective on pricing. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $14000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to its true value, while also taking into account your budget considerations. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution. Please let me know if this revised price works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground here. In light of your latest offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13750 for the product.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that I might need to look elsewhere if we can't meet in the middle. Can you consider one more time?",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your patience and understanding. After reviewing our previous discussions, I would like to extend a final counteroffer of $13625 for the product. This is a slight increase from my last proposal, aiming to find a balance between our interests. I hope this revised price will be acceptable to you, allowing us to move forward with the transaction.",13625.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but that's as high as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options. Can you really not go any lower?",13500.0,Bob,8,
