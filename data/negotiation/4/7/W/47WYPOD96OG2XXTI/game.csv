"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I am looking for a more reasonable price within my budget. Could we perhaps discuss a price closer to $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1500000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's find a compromise. I'm open to selling for $1750000. This still allows me to make a profit while acknowledging your budget constraints. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. However, I am still not able to meet the price of $1750000. Would it be possible to negotiate further? I am willing to consider a price of $1600000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
