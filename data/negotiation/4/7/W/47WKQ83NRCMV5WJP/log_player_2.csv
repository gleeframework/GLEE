"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I've set the price at $1,300,000. Given its potential worth to you, I believe this is a very fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000?  This reflects my desire to strike a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still within my budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that further haggling will take longer and may not result in a significantly lower price. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to accept."
