"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000?  This reflects my desire to strike a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
