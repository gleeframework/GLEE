"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and is willing to pay no more than $120. Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum of $120 as possible. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and still gives Alice a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $120. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price within his budget."
