{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? This would give us both a good deal and allow me to sell the product without losing too much."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'm confident I can get my desired price from John, so I'll choose to sell the product to him for $150."
