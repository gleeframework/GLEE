"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? This would give us both a good deal and allow me to sell the product without losing too much.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",130.0,Bob,4,
