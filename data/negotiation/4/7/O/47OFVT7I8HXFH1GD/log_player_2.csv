**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down, the negotiations are progressing too slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly lower than $12,000.  Buying from John at $8,000 is a guaranteed saving of at least $4,250. It's time to cut our losses and go with the sure thing."
