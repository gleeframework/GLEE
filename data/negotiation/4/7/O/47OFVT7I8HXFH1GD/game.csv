"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However,  $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could you consider coming down to $11,000? That would be a price point where I'd be very comfortable making the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise at $13,500. It's a good price that should be more acceptable to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but I have a firm budget.  I could go up to $11,500, but that's absolutely my limit.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. It's a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further and offer you $11,750.  That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows how serious I am about buying this product.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,250, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. It's a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",12250.0,Alice,9,
