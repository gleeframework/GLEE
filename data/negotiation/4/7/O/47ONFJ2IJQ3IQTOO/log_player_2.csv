"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives me the chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but one that's still within my budget.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this will spark a negotiation that leads to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than my desired price.  I'm confident I can negotiate further and get a better deal.  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially achieve a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. I'm still below her offer, but closer than before. This keeps the negotiation moving and demonstrates my seriousness while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my desired price.  I'm getting closer to a deal, but I'm still determined to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price. However, I'm still staying below $950,000, my previous rejection point. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering a price that is very close to my upper limit.  However, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  While I could potentially get a slightly better price with more negotiation, the risk of reaching a stalemate is high. 

Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, which is within my budget and significantly lower than Alice's current offer, it's more advantageous to buy from John at this point."
