"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($12,000). 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" for Bob, which might make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation by asking for his opinion. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation that could lead to a higher price. If Bob rejects, I have 9 more rounds to negotiate or walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my previous price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Framing my goal:** I subtly mention my ""target price,"" hinting that I'm not willing to go much lower.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the pressure on Bob to increase his offer. If Bob still refuses, I can continue negotiating in the remaining rounds, always with the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is getting closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John for $12,000 remains a solid backup option. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating in hopes of getting a higher price. I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away entirely, but also need to hold firm to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  While $8,000 is a fair price for a similar product, the one I'm offering is unique and holds significant value.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Think about it, and let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Highlighting the product's value:**  I'm reinforcing that the product's unique qualities justify a higher price.
* **Splitting the difference:**  This demonstrates a genuine desire to compromise while still protecting my bottom line. 
* **Framing it as a fair deal:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness, hoping it will sway his decision.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly higher price while emphasizing the product's uniqueness, I'm attempting to find a balance between meeting Bob's needs and achieving my own financial goals.  I'm also leaving the door open for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8200. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,200 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired price of $12,000.  I have 4 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John for $12,000 remains a solid backup option, but I want to explore all possibilities with Bob before making that decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating in hopes of getting a higher price.  I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away entirely, but also need to hold firm to my minimum price. I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point, while still appearing willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I understand your budget constraints, $8,200 is still too far off from my desired price.  How about we meet at $8,700?  This allows me to take a small loss, but it also gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns to show empathy and keep the conversation open.
* **Small Loss Framing:** I frame the offer as a ""small loss"" for me, making it seem more appealing to Bob. 
* **Highlighting the value again:**  I reiterate that the product is valuable, justifying the higher price point.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being reasonable for Bob.  This offer also creates a sense of urgency, as I'm indicating that I'm willing to take a loss, suggesting that I may not be willing to negotiate further.  However, I'm still open to negotiation in the remaining rounds, keeping John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $8200. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire with only two rounds left.  Bob's latest offer of $8,200 is still too low for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of success, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is high.  

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time and the uncertainty of further negotiation, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer of $12,000.  This guarantees me a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements and allows me to avoid the potential disappointment of further negotiations with Bob falling through."
