"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  While $8000 is a fair price for a similar product, the one I'm offering is unique and holds significant value.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Think about it, and let me know what you decide.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I understand your budget constraints, $8200 is still too far off from my desired price.  How about we meet at $8700?  This allows me to take a small loss, but it also gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,7,
