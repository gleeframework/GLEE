Round 2

Round 6

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $800,000 mark within the remaining rounds.  The increments are getting smaller, and it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations. John provides a guaranteed $800,000, which is the minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut bait with Bob and secure the sure thing with John."
