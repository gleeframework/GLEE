"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.  It also shows that I'm confident in the value of my product.  I'm aware this might be a bit aggressive, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high his value for the product might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm confident there's room for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away the product for a pittance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,000.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good deal considering my minimum is $15,000.  We're nearing the end of the rounds, and it's not worth risking getting a lower price or selling to John for the same amount."
