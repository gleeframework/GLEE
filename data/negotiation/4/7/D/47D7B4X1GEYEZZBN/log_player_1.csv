Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's something truly special, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm starting with an offer of $900,000. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I believe I can offer you a fairer deal. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a good amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price, especially since the product is worth $800,000 to him. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the market conditions. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $825,000 is a good price, and it's only $25,000 less than what John is offering. There's a chance I could get a better deal in the next round, but it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
