Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It's still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his price, and while I would like to make more, it's not worth continuing this negotiation.  John is offering my minimum price, which is acceptable to me."
