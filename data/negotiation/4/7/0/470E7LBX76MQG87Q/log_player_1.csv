"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob doesn't know the true value and I want to leave room for negotiation. 
* **High but realistic:**  While $1,000,000 is a significant number, it's not outlandishly high given the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to frame the offer as a valuable opportunity.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction and counteroffers (if any). I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:**  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value ($800,000), I'm not ready to settle just yet.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation, and Bob seems motivated to buy the product. 
* **More rounds to leverage:** With 8 rounds left, I have time to see if I can push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I'll likely propose a price slightly lower than $1,000,000 but higher than $950,000, to show flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Given the value of this product, I'd be willing to consider $975,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm referencing the product's value to reinforce its worth and justify my asking price.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:** $975,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum value of $800,000, allowing for a healthy profit.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll close the deal.  If he rejects, I'll continue negotiating, keeping in mind John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $960000 as the price for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $960,000 is very close to my desired price point, and it's only $15,000 less than my last counteroffer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that Bob will continue to bargain down if I reject his offer. 
* **Time pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk running out of time and having to sell to John for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal. While I might have been able to get a slightly higher price, securing the sale at $960,000 is a good outcome, especially considering the limited time remaining."
