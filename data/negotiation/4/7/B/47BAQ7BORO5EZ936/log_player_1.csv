"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to capture as much of the potential value as possible.  It's likely Bob will reject this initial offer, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a good amount for Bob, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping that by demonstrating some flexibility, I can get Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  We're still early in the negotiation, and I have the option to sell to John if I don't get a satisfactory deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,550,000.  This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable value, so I'm getting closer to where I need to be.  At this point, I'm willing to be more flexible, but I still want to get as close to $1,600,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,480,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I have John as a backup, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob for a slightly higher price.  I believe I can get Bob to budge just a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1520000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer again to $1,520,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I want to make sure that I don't lose a valuable opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,490,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I haven't been able to get Bob up to my minimum acceptable value. While $1,490,000 is a good price, it's still not enough for me.  To guarantee that I get my minimum acceptable value, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
