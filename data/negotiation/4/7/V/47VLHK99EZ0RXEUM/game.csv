"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
