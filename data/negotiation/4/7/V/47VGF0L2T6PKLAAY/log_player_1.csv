Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's particularly interested, increasing your potential profit.
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering it for a price too close to $12,000 might make Bob walk away, leaving you to sell to John at your minimum price anyway.

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
