"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer if you don't accept.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $142.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",142.5,Alice,5,
