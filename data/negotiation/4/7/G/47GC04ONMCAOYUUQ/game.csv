"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
