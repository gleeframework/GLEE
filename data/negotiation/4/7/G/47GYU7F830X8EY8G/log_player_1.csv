{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm really looking to spend no more than $8,500.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I have 8 more rounds to work with, and I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a fair price, and I think it still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Even though $8,750 is closer to my minimum than before, I have 6 more rounds to try and get a better deal.  I'm not yet willing to sell for less than $9,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still hoping to get the product for $8,500, but I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but we are getting closer.  I have 4 rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I don't want to sell to John yet because I still have the potential to get closer to my ideal price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $8,750 is still too low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,850? It's a fair price, and it lets us both close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8850}
