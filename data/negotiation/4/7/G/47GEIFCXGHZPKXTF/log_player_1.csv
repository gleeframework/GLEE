Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."

I'm countering with $14,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm still trying to get a higher price than Bob's last offer.  We're getting closer to an agreement, but I still believe there's room for Bob to come up a bit more."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm approaching my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I have a few rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell yet.  Let's see if Bob will budge a little more before I consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is getting close to Bob's last offer and my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on.  I'm feeling the pressure of the dwindling rounds, so I'm hoping this is acceptable to Bob."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. We are approaching the end of our rounds and Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower.  I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing, as he may stop offering further.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than nothing and at least meets my minimum."
