{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not ready to accept. I'm going to try and squeeze out a better deal in the remaining rounds. There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's higher than I'm comfortable with."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm raising my offer again to $1,000,000.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and it's very close to Alice's current offer of $1,050,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm still not willing to go over my budget. With only two rounds left, this should create a bit of pressure on Alice to come down a bit more."
