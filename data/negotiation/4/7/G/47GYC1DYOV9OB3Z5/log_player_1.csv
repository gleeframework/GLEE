"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get close to my minimum of $1,200,000.  I'll also be ready to consider his counteroffer, but I'll try to hold firm on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I need to aim for something closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this point.  If he doesn't, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to get him closer to my price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more, but still holding firm on getting a good return.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway at this point. If not, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not meeting my minimum. I need to see if we can bridge the gap further. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  However, if we don't reach a compromise soon, selling to John will become a more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This is my final offer to Bob. I'm coming down to a price that is closer to his perceived value, but still above my minimum. If he rejects this offer, I will sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is close, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob is too high. I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
