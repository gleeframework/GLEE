Round 2

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm getting closer to my budget, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is still quite low, though I'm motivated to sell.  Would you consider $13,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $11,500. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $11,500. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, it's in your best interest to sell to John and avoid the risk of Bob not budging further."
