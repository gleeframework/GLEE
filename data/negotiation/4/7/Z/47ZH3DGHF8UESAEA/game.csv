"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm getting closer to my budget, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is still quite low, though I'm motivated to sell.  Would you consider $13,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $11,500. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,6,
