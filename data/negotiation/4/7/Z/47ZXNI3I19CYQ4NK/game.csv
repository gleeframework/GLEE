"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to agree on a price that reflects the true value of the product, my budget constraints are quite tight. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable and we can move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
