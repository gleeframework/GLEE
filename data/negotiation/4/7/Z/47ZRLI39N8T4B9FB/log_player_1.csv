Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I'm starting high, offering it at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested but wants to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Going for the full $120 might make Bob feel like I'm not willing to negotiate at all, potentially turning him off.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
