,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to $90. How about $88? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find this product valuable at that price.",88.0,Alice,5,
