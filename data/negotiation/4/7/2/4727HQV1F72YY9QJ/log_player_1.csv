I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $120 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will find this more appealing and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
