"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $5,000?  That seems like a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $7,000? That gets us closer to a deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too far below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
