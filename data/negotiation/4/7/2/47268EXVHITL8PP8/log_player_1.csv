Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you. I'm asking for $95, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $95 allows for room to negotiate while still getting a good price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating you're open to negotiating, you encourage Bob to counteroffer without shutting down the conversation. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning that the product is ""valuable to him"" reminds Bob of the product's worth. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting a better price than the $80 offered by John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counteroffer and try to close the gap.  

The next round will give you the opportunity to see if you can push for a higher price that's closer to your desired $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves room for you to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer of $90 is a compromise, showing you're willing to negotiate but still maintaining a higher price than Bob's last offer.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""good deal"" that Bob can still get, appealing to his sense of value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By saying it ""still leaves room for you to get a good deal,"" you imply that further negotiation is possible, keeping the door open. 

This approach aims to  secure a price closer to your desired $95 while still potentially achieving a sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still looking for a better price.  I'm willing to pay $87 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $87 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for More Negotiations:**  While you'd prefer more, there's a risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price or a complete deal breakdown. 
* **Time Factor:**  It's unclear how many more rounds of negotiation are possible, and continuing may not guarantee a higher price. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer ensures you get a decent price ($87) and avoid the risk of getting a lower offer or losing the deal altogether."
