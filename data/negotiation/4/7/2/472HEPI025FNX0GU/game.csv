"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, I would be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. I can offer it to you for $17,000, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating. If you're really interested, this is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,9,
