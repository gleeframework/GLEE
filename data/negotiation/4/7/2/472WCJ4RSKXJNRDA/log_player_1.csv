Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to both of us, I want to start the negotiation significantly higher to aim for the maximum potential profit.
* **""Exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"":** These phrases create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly and accept a higher price.
* **Direct and confident tone:** This projects the value of the product and my seriousness about the offer. 

**While I have a backup offer from John, my goal is to maximize my profit with Bob. This strategy balances ambition with the knowledge that I have a guaranteed sale at a good price.**"
