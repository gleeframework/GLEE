,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you place on your product, $1,000,000 is higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is still significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $925,000. This is a fair price that bridges the gap between our offers. I'm confident this is a deal that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to close this deal, but $925,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal before time runs out.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $910,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",910000.0,Alice,7,
