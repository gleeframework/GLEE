{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you place on your product, $1,000,000 is higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is still significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm getting closer to my limit and will need to consider buying from John soon if I can't reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $925,000. This is a fair price that bridges the gap between our offers. I'm confident this is a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm running out of time, but I'm hoping I can get Alice to come down further in price. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if that fails, I'll have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm eager to close this deal, but $925,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $910,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $910,000 is still above my budget. With only a few rounds left, it's likely I won't be able to negotiate a lower price. It's better to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further risk of not closing a deal at all."
