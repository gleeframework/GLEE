"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you place on your product, $1,000,000 is higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $850,000 is still too low, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better price.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is still significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is closer to my target, I still believe I can do better. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let's keep going!"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm eager to close this deal, but $925,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal before time runs out.

While $900,000 is tempting, I have 4 rounds left and still believe we can close a bit higher. I'm going to counter one last time to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
