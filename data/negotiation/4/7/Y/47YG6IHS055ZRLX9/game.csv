"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,580,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the sale.",1580000.0,Alice,5,
