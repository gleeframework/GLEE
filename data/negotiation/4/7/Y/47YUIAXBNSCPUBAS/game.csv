"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we aim for a price closer to $1,000,000? I think this would be a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to make a profit on this product. $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows you a substantial value for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. I'd like to continue negotiating towards a price that benefits both of us. How about we aim for $1,025,000? This offers a reasonable compromise while keeping the price lower than your initial offer.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground. While $1,025,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while remaining fair for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
