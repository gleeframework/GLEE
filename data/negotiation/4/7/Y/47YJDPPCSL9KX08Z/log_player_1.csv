Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without directly stating it's worth more than Bob's valuation.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrases like ""What are your thoughts?"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects or counter-offers."
