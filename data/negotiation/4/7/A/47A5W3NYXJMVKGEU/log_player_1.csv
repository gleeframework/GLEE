"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but it's important to leave room for negotiation. I want to see how Bob values the product and gauge his potential for going higher. 

By offering a high price first, I establish a baseline and create leverage.  I'm also leaving myself room to make concessions if necessary, as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below what I'd like to achieve.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John because I believe I can potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating flexibility, while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer remains at $1,200,000. While this is closer to my acceptable minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. I still have several rounds to go, and there's a chance Bob might be willing to go a little higher. I'm going to try another counteroffer, but if it's rejected again, I might be more open to accepting his offer or even considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my offer slightly to $1,300,000. I'm recognizing that Bob might not be willing to go higher, but I'm still hoping to get a better price than his last offer. I'm also considering the fact that I'm approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I need to be mindful of time. If Bob rejects this offer, I might be more inclined to accept his last offer or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time Bob has raised his offer to $1,250,000.  This is significantly closer to my desired range and a good compromise.  While I'd prefer to get even more, I'm aware that we are approaching the middle of the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal. 

Given Bob's improved offer and the limited rounds remaining, I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,250,000."
