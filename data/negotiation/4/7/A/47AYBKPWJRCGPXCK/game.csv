"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its potential worth. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to  $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $600,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to work with you. Could you consider $1,900,000? I'm confident this revised price reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That's still a bit too high for my budget. To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be feasible for me. ",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a fair deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see where you're coming from, but that price is still beyond my reach. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I can't go beyond $750,000. Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,
