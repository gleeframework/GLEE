``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price is still below what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for potential concessions and counteroffers.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 floor I've set for myself. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm confident I can secure a higher price with further negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:**  John is a safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for his offer yet.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price.  $900,000 is the lowest I can go at this stage.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  Even though Bob has moved closer, his offer is still below my minimum of $800,000. 
* **Time to Be Firm:**  I've already made two concessions. It's time to be more firm and push for a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Rejecting Bob's offer puts pressure on him to improve his offer further.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still not within my range.

Let's see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer, while a slight increase, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to make one final offer of $890,000. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1,000,000.

* **Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $800,000.

Given the circumstances and the limited time, selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision at this point."
