Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it would be a highly worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have a significant advantage knowing that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over, leaving him with a perceived gain.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Optional):** While not implemented here, you could start slightly higher (e.g., $1,175,000) to allow for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** You have the security of John's offer, guaranteeing you your minimum price. This allows you to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer if he misjudges your minimum or tries to negotiate for a drastically lower price.  However, this offer balances risk and potential reward effectively."
