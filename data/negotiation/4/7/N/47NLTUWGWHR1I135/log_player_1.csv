"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still provides a good profit margin for me. I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of rounds, I still believe I can get a better price than Bob's current offer of $9,800. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm going to risk it and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,200. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and above John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly less willing to negotiate. While I'm still hoping to make a better deal than selling to John, I'm afraid we're running out of time. With only four rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal at all is too high.  Therefore, I'm going to accept John's offer of $10,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
