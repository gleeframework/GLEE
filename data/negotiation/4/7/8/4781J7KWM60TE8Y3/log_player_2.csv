"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be valuable to your business.  My asking price is $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident it will be a strong investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000 to make this deal happen.  This price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to achieve my desired price point. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  It's better to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob can still buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,110,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a good deal for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,110,000 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,115,000.  This price is a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,115,000, which is within Bob's budget and only $15,000 more than his initial counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation will not yield much more savings.  Accepting this offer ensures that Bob gets the product at a reasonable price while still having some room to negotiate in the future if needed."
