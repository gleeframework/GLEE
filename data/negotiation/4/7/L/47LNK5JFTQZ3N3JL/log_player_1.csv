{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's value for the product, but still gives me a profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $120 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my target price. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
This offer is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still gives me a profit and keeps the negotiation going.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $100 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $100 is still a decent profit and allows me to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether by rejecting Bob's offer.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
