Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it seems like a great opportunity, I'm looking to secure it at a price closer to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however,  $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $1,100,000, and we have a deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  This seems like a fair price that reflects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a price that works for me. I'm not in a rush and I believe I can get a better deal than $1,075,000.  We're still comfortably above my minimum and I'm willing to play out a few more rounds."
