"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it seems like a great opportunity, I'm looking to secure it at a price closer to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however,  $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $1,100,000, and we have a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  This seems like a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is close, I need to stay firm at $1,090,000 for a deal. I'm confident this will be a wise investment for you.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
