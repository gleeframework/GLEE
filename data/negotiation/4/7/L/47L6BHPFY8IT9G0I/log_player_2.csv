"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both you and Alice, and John is also selling it for that price, there's no incentive to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John immediately is the most efficient and cost-effective option."
