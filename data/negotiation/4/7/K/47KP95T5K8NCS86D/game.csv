"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $80, which would be $102.50. Would you be willing to accept this price?",102.5,Bob,6,
