"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, there's potential to negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal. Since his maximum budget is $15,000, he's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer while still leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer signals his willingness to compromise while aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer of $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer ensures a good deal while also minimizing the risk of the negotiations falling apart. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and with limited rounds, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
