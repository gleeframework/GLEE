"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the potential benefits both of us stand to gain from this transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This reflects the true value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
