"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum price of $80. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  How about $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my maximum price of $80, it's still too high.  I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
