"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is a decent price, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for further negotiation."
