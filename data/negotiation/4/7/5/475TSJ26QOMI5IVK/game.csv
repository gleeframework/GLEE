"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",135.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $165 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $145.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",145.0,Bob,4,
