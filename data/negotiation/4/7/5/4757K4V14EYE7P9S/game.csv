"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $11,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to sell to John for $12,000 if we can't reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
