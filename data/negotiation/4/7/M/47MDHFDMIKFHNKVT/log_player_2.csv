"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's $1,000,000 limit.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $1,100,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still above his $1,000,000 limit.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer will give Bob another chance to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling a little frustrated with this back and forth.  $1,075,000 is simply not close enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000 as a final concession. Let's try to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible, $1,090,000 is very close to his maximum budget.  The negotiation has reached a point where Alice is likely to stick to this price.  It's a better deal than buying from John, and there's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a breakdown and Bob being unable to purchase the product at all.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer."
