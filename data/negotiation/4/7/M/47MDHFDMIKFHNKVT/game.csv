"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm feeling a little frustrated with this back and forth.  $1,075,000 is simply not close enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000 as a final concession. Let's try to get this deal done.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
