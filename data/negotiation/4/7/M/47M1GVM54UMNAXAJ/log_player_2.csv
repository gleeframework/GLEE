"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering allows for potential savings.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  This is the most expensive option and should only be considered if negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  I'm starting with a bold counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for a more favorable negotiation.
* **Within My Budget:** My offer is still within my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's room for Alice to counter with a price higher than $1,100,000 but still lower than her initial offer."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to my maximum budget, but I'm aiming to save as much as possible.
* **More Negotiation Needed:**  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to continue exploring lower prices.
* **John is still the last resort.**  While his price is tempting, I want to exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

* **John is still the last resort.** While he offers a quick solution, I'm determined to try to save as much money as possible through negotiation."

Round 6

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise while staying within my budget.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** I'm trying to find a price that bridges the gap between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to find a price that Alice might accept."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Alice to meet me in the middle.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, I need to make a significant move towards a price that could potentially lead to a deal.
* **Balancing Risk:**  This offer is risky as it's still above my ideal price, but it's a calculated gamble to see if it convinces Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

* **Only one round left.**  There's no time to negotiate further.
* **John's price is the same as Alice's.** There's no benefit to continuing to negotiate with Alice.  
* **I want to secure the product.**  It's better to buy from John and avoid the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice entirely."
