"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the potential value in this product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down slightly. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This price still reflects the product's worth and allows for a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
