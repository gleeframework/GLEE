"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth a significant amount to you. My asking price is $950000, which is still well below its true value to you. This is a chance to secure something that will benefit your business considerably. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $950,000.** This is less than the $1,000,000 you would pay John.
* **Your goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer."
