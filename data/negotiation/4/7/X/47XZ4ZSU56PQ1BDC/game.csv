,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $9,500 is too low.  Could you consider $12,000?  It's a fairer reflection of its worth.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth $12,000, but I still think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, so I'll offer $10,750 for it. Can we agree on that price?",10750.0,Bob,4,
