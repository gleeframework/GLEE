"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12000 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and agree on $14500? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
