"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we start at $10,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, aiming to establish a clear negotiation range.  He highlights the product's value to both parties as a justification for his proposed price. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth, hoping to ultimately land on a mutually agreeable price within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target. He's willing to pay $12,000 for the product from John as a last resort, but he's determined to get a better deal from Alice if possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit high for me. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This would be a good deal for both of us and avoids the need to involve John. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price with this counteroffer. He's aiming for a compromise that's still within his budget but also reasonable for Alice, demonstrating a genuine desire to close the deal. He's also subtly reminding Alice about John, suggesting that she may not want to risk losing the deal entirely."
