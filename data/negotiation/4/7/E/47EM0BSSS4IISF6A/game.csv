"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
