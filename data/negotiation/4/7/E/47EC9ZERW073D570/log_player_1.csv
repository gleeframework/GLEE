Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Friendly Tone:** I want to establish a positive rapport with Bob to encourage him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  This encourages Bob to respond and allows me to gauge his initial interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  My minimum price is $80, and Bob has offered that amount. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  There's no benefit to me in continuing to negotiate. I can sell to John for the same price.  
* **Time is money:**  Accepting the offer saves time and ensures a quick sale."
