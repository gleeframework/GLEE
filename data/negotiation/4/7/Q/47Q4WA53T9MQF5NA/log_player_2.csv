"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting the offer. $180 is way above your maximum budget of $80. You can do much better with either a counteroffer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $160 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, so continuing to negotiate with Alice is the better option."

$155 is still higher than your budget, and you can still get the product from John for $80.  Keep negotiating."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is getting closer to your budget, it's still outside of it.  You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, so it's still worth it to continue negotiating."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but with only one round left, it's not likely she will drop to your desired price. It's safer to buy from John for $80 and ensure you get the product within your budget."
