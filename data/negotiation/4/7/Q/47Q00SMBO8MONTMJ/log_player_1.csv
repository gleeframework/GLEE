Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire it at a compelling price."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 offer is:
    * Above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving us negotiation room.
    * Below our guaranteed sale price, ensuring a profit if Bob accepts.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the price as a strategic opportunity rather than a mere starting point for haggling.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  We don't know how aggressively Bob might negotiate. A different approach might be needed if we knew he was particularly hard-nosed.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If we were under time pressure, we might be more inclined to offer it directly to John at $1,200,000 to secure the sale."
