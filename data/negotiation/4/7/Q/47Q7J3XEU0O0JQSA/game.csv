"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to meet my needs and you to get a valuable product. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
