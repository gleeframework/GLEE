"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  While I do think the product is valuable, my budget is pushing it.  Could you do $9,500?  That's a firm offer on my end.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a little too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to make this work. This is my final offer - if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
