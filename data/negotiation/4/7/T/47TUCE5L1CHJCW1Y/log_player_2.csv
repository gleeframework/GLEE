It's always worth trying to get a better deal.  Since you have a maximum price of $15,000 and Alice is offering $12,000, there's room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get an even lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

Let's start with a lower price. $10,000 is a good starting point for our counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."

We're getting closer to my ideal price, but $11,500 is still a bit high. I'll keep negotiating, hoping to get Alice down to my target price of $10,500."

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $11,000. This is a compromise between Alice's offer of $11,500 and my previous offer of $10,500. I'm hoping she'll see this as a fair compromise and accept."

Alice's offer is back to her initial price of $12,000. It's a little frustrating, but I'm not giving up. We're getting close, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is now higher than what John is selling for.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. I've tried to negotiate, but it's not worth the risk of going another round and potentially getting a worse offer."
