"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I am willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a fair reflection of this product's value - especially considering what you could gain from it. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000, but I can't go any lower. I think this is a very reasonable compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still looking to keep the cost below $1,250,000. I am prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
