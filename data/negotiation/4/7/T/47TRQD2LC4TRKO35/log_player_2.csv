{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $110 is a decent price, I can likely get it for less. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more.  I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking with $90, but that's just not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good deal for both of us, as I'm getting closer to your offer, and you're getting the product for a price lower than my original offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm still hoping to get the price down to $90, and I only have five rounds left. It's getting close to the time when I might need to go with John's offer. But, I'm going to hold out and see if I can get Alice to accept $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle.  How about we settle on $92? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $94?  It's a fair price that's closer to both of our expectations.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm running out of time and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed price from John and avoid any further risk of negotiation."
