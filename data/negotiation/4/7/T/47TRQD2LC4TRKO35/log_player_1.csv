"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a decent discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested at this price point before going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I'm not willing to sell at that price yet. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not willing to sell at that price yet.  I'm hopeful we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking with $90, but that's just not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good deal for both of us, as I'm getting closer to your offer, and you're getting the product for a price lower than my original offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle.  How about we settle on $92? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the profit margin. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that's more beneficial for both of us. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $94?  It's a fair price that's closer to both of our expectations.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 94}
