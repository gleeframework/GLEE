You can do better than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

You're still closer to your target price of $8,000 than Alice is.  Let's try another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."

Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:

```

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is a good deal for you, even though you were hoping for $10,500. Accepting this offer is the best option because you're getting a good price, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the next round. You also risk losing the deal entirely if Alice decides to sell to someone else."
