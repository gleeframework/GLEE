"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the worth of this product. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,650,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me.  To be candid, I have another buyer interested at a lower price, but I'd much rather close this deal with you.  How about we settle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me.  Let's see if we can finalize this. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I believe this is a win-win scenario, and it keeps us both within our desired price ranges.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
