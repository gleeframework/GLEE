Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $175?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but $175 is still a bit much for me. Could we settle on $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $145?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer. There's a good chance she won't budge much from $145, and it's better to secure the deal at $145 than risk it going up or missing out altogether."
