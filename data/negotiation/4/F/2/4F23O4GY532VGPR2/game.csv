"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer for now.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my last offer before considering other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
