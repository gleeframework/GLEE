"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. Given its value to you, this seems like a fair price that allows us both to benefit. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's room for negotiation.  You're willing to pay $150 to John, so rejecting Alice's offer might push her to lower her price closer to her own valuation of $120."
