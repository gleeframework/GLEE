I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value.  This gives me some room to negotiate and also signals that I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I can get $100 from John.  I'll choose to sell to John to maximize my profit."
