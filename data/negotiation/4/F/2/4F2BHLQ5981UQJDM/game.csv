,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a good starting point, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a unique product, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that it's a unique product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a good compromise, but I'm still not sure if it's enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $105, which would be $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced it's worth $107.50. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $108?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $108 is a good offer, but I'm still not sure if it's enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $108, which would be $109. Can you consider that?",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth. I'm willing to meet you at $108, just like I said before. If you're not willing to meet me at $108, I'm going to have to consider other options. Can you really not do $108?",108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting frustrated, and I apologize if the negotiations are taking too long. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $108. I'm willing to meet you at $109.50, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",109.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $108. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to walk away and consider buying the product from John for $120. I think that's a fair price, and I'm not going to overpay for this product.",108.0,Bob,10,
