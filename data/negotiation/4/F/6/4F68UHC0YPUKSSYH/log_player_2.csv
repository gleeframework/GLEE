"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob, but he can likely get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and going back up to $900,000 or even her original price of $1,200,000 is too high.  Accepting the $850,000 offer is a good deal, saving Bob $350,000 compared to buying from John."
