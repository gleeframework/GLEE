"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a premium price of $12,000. I believe in its value and think it would be highly beneficial for you. However, I do have other interested buyers, and if this price doesn't suit you, I'll understand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save $4,000."
