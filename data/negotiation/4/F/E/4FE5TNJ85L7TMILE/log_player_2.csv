"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds remaining, and there's a good chance Bob can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is out of my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will provide a good return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible.  It's important to start with a firm counteroffer and provide a reasonable justification for the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I've done extensive research and analysis, and its true market value is much higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it is still above Bob's desired price range. It is important to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to go lower. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob has time to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, but still keeping it well within his budget. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on his price point. It also frames the negotiation as finding a solution that works for both parties, which could encourage Alice to be more amenable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,600,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept it at this time. I'm willing to consider $1,750,000 as my final offer. This represents a substantial compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling very confident about $1,650,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe this price reflects the value we've both discussed. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing that he's willing to negotiate. It's still below Alice's offer, and it's framed as a way to find common ground, which could encourage Alice to compromise. With five rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate, but Bob is getting closer to his target price."
