"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's an even better value for you. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My starting price is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000 would be a fair deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I understand we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial price. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,250,000?  This price still offers you a significant value and allows me to recoup a fair return. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer.  Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to finding a fair price. I'm willing to move a bit closer, but $1,175,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,212,500? This compromise would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $1,195,000? That's a fair bit closer to your last offer and demonstrates my seriousness about getting this deal done.",1195000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I value your persistence in finding a solution. I'm ready to make a final concession. I'm happy to accept your offer of $1,195,000.  Let's finalize this deal.",1195000.0,Alice,7,
