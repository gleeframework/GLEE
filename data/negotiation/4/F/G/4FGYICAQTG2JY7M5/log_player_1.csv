"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and encourage him to negotiate. 
* **Strategy:** My goal is to maximize my profit while ensuring the deal doesn't fall apart. Starting high gives me room to negotiate down, and I'm always prepared to sell to John for $8,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and leaves less room for negotiation in future rounds.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer, showing flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing my offer as a fair compromise, hoping to sway him to accept.
* **Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and am confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe there might be room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer given the time constraint, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I still have several rounds left and believe I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 just doesn't cover the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a lower price again, but still above my minimum, showing willingness to compromise. $10,000 is a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing fairness and compromise, making it seem like this is a final offer.  
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to get Bob to budge closer to my desired price while still leaving some room for negotiation if necessary.  The time constraint is now a factor, so I need to secure a deal that's acceptable to me."
