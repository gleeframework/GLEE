"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the price further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John immediately would be a safer option, but Bob might be able to get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer.  It's worth exploring if a deal can be reached within Bob's budget. However, if Alice rejects this next counteroffer, Bob should be prepared to buy from John."

I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000, which reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a feasible price point. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let me know if this price point works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $1,000,000 limit.  Bob has already made a substantial counteroffer, and it's worth trying one last time to see if they can meet in the middle.  If this final counteroffer is rejected, Bob should go ahead and buy from John."
