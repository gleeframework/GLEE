"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be happy to pay $1,050,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I'm hoping we can finalize a deal soon.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but I'm at my absolute limit at $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal, as I'm close to going with another seller.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
