"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is quite high ($900,000). While you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, John offers the product for that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her or simply buy it from John and save $100,000."
