Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above her own minimum ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning another potential buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing Alice to potentially secure a price even closer to $11,500."
