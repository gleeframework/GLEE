"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a reasonable counteroffer by offering $130. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $140, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit as the product is worth $120 to her.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price for Bob.  It's still cheaper than buying from John, and leaves Alice with a profit margin.  There's always the risk of getting a lower price in future rounds, but the chance of Alice going lower is uncertain, and Bob risks losing the deal altogether. It's a good compromise."
