"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to let it go for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $101. That way we both get a good deal. What do you think?",101.0,Alice,5,
