"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $101. That way we both get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed best price."
