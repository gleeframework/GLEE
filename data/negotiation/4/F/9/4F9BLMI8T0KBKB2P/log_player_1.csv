While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,275,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** This price still yields a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out negotiations further could lead to Bob losing interest or becoming frustrated.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now gives me access to the funds sooner, allowing me to potentially reinvest or utilize them elsewhere."
