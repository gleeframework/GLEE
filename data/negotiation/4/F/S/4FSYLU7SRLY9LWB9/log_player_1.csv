Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's still below his perceived value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John for $100, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob with a price of $130. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my initial offer. It's still a good price for me, while leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $115 isn't my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and better than selling to John for $100.  I'm willing to close the deal at this point to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
