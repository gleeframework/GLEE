"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you first dibs on a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but that's still quite a gap from where I'd feel comfortable. Perhaps we can find a more agreeable number around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end, recognizing your interest while still reflecting the true value of this unique item.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  However, to be honest, anything above $1,100,000 is going to be a very tough sell for me.  Do you think you can meet me closer to there?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible as well. Let's settle this right now - $1,300,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
