# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you first dibs on a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end, recognizing your interest while still reflecting the true value of this unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  However, to be honest, anything above $1,100,000 is going to be a very tough sell for me.  Do you think you can meet me closer to there?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible as well. Let's settle this right now - $1,300,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to move much closer to my $1,100,000 mark.  While I might be able to negotiate her down a bit more, it's not worth the risk of exceeding my $1,000,000 budget. John offers a guaranteed price that aligns with my limit."
