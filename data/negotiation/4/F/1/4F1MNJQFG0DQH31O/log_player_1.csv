"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you first dibs on a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob view subsequent offers as more reasonable, even if they are still above his initial valuation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price allows ample room for negotiation over the next 10 rounds. 
* **Confidence:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which is important in a high-stakes negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's good to get Bob's initial counter on the table, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's time to start guiding the negotiation closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by making a substantial drop from the initial price. However, it remains well above both your minimum and Bob's opening offer, keeping the negotiation alive.
* **Justification:**  By re-emphasizing the product's unique value, you're reminding Bob of its worth and justifying the still-high price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's flexibility and provide further insight into his potential price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but that's still quite a gap from where I'd feel comfortable. Perhaps we can find a more agreeable number around $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his perceived value for the product. However, you still have a significant gap to bridge to reach your minimum price. While selling to John is an option, there's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end, recognizing your interest while still reflecting the true value of this unique item."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering to meet Bob exactly halfway between his current offer ($1,000,000) and your previous counteroffer ($1,900,000) presents a strong case for compromise.
* **Anchoring to Your Minimum:**  This offer is still slightly above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000), providing a small buffer for further negotiation, but it signals a willingness to make a deal.
* **Creating Urgency:**  As the rounds progress, subtly introducing a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision. Highlighting the ""unique item"" reminds him of the potential loss if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  However, to be honest, anything above $1,100,000 is going to be a very tough sell for me.  Do you think you can meet me closer to there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly moving towards your acceptable range, accepting $1,100,000 still means a significant loss compared to selling to John. There's a risk that Bob won't budge much higher, but with 4 rounds remaining, it's worth trying to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible as well. Let's settle this right now - $1,300,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer represents a significant concession from your previous offer, but it is still above your absolute minimum. It strikes a balance between trying to secure a higher price and recognizing the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're serious about closing the deal now. This can prompt Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer gives you some room to negotiate down slightly, potentially to $1,250,000, in the remaining rounds while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price."
