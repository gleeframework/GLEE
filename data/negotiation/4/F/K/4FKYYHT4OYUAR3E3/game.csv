"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That would be a win-win for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
