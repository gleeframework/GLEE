"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $750,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $675,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $675,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum. I can offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $725,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $700,000. Would you be open to $690,000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",690000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target, Bob. However, $690,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum. I can offer it to you for $715,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",715000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can tell you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that. How about $705,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it.",705000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $710,000, but that's as low as I can go. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. This is my final offer.",710000.0,Alice,9,
