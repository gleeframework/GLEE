"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking for a better price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
