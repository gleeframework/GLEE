(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $12,000, Bob has room to negotiate. There are 9 rounds remaining, so there's time to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strategy to show his willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal quickly. However, it's also within the range where it's still worth it for Alice to sell, considering her value of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's counteroffer. While it's lower than John's price, Bob still has time to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price. There are 7 rounds left, so there's a good chance of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. However, it's still below Alice's offer and closer to the middle ground. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and encourage her to move closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Bob still has time to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price. There are 5 rounds left, so there's still a good chance of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. However, it's still below Alice's offer,  and closer to the middle ground. With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob needs to find a price that works for both parties to avoid resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now below $9,500, the price Bob initially rejected.  With only 3 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  Bob can either accept this offer, getting the product for a decent price, or risk being left with only John's high price. Accepting the offer is the most logical choice at this point."
