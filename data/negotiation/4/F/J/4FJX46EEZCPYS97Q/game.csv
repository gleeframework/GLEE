"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $10000 is just too low for me. I'd be happy to meet you halfway at $11000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to make a final concession. How about we settle on $10500? This price reflects the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for you.  Let's close this deal and make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, but I'm afraid $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000, which is the price I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you accept this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
