"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its value.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000.  It's a fair offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $14,500 is still too high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go above $13,000.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap.",13000.0,Bob,6,
