Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This price will give me a sense of Bob's seriousness and potential budget. 
* **Prepared to negotiate:** I'm prepared to lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'll aim to keep it above my minimum value.

**Remember:** 

* This is just the initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. 
* I'm also aware of John's offer as a safety net, ensuring I won't be forced to sell for less than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is below my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's rejection shows he's interested but values the product less than my initial asking price. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **Exploring potential:** I'm going to counteroffer to try to reach a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and maintain value:** I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000, which shows a willingness to compromise. However, this price is still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is closer to Bob's offer of $900,000, demonstrating that I'm willing to find a middle ground. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd ideally get closer to $1,200,000, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price is high.
* **Securing the deal:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale above my minimum and ensures I don't have to sell to John for a lower price.

**Reasoning:** 

This situation presents a calculated risk.  While I could attempt to negotiate further, there's a chance Bob could walk away, forcing me to sell to John for a lower amount. Accepting this offer secures a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of losing out entirely."
