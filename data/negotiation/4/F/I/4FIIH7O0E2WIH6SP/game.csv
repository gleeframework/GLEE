"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer but $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair value given my needs and the market.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $22,000 represents the high-end value this product brings, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $17,000? This reflects my effort in developing and bringing this unique product to market, while still offering you significant value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm  willing to go up to $14,000, which is a substantial compromise on my end. This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
