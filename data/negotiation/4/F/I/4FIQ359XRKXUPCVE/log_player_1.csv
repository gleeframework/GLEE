Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  This price ensures a profit of $1,500 over your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and is a significant portion of the potential profit from Bob ($2,000).

By offering a price that's attractive to Bob but also beneficial to you, you increase the chances of a successful sale at a higher profit margin than selling to John."
