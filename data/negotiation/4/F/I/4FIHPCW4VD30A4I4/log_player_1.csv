Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for potential bargaining.  It's a good starting point to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, but it's still below your ideal.  There's still room for negotiation to potentially get closer to $1,150,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and your previous offer. It shows you're willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer.  While it's still not ideal, it's very close to what you're willing to accept, and further negotiation might just lead to a stalemate.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best decision to ensure a sale and secure a price that's within your acceptable range."
