Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $100. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That way, we can both walk away happy with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're so close!  $98 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $94?  It's a fair price that's within our both of our budgets, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $94. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $97. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:  You've been negotiating for a while, and Alice is still holding out for a higher price than you're comfortable with. With only one round left, it's not likely you'll be able to get Alice to come down to your desired price point. It's more efficient to take the guaranteed $80 deal from John."
