"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $10,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum valuation. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:** 

Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's allows room for negotiation.  While $6,000 is a significant difference, it expresses strong interest while setting a firm lower boundary.  Alice is likely to counter, giving us more information to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, which is a good sign. However, $8,500 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $8,500 is closer, my budget for this is limited to $7,000.  If you're able to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to John's price, but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  By mentioning you're ""ready to close the deal"", you subtly introduce a sense of urgency.
* **Justification:** Giving a reason for your counter-offer (""budget is limited"") can make it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000 to close this deal quickly. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your maximum budget and matched John's offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation, as you are unlikely to secure a lower price.  Accepting now guarantees you the product at the best possible price."
