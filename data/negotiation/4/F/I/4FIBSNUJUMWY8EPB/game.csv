"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $10,000 is fair. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $8,500 is closer, my budget for this is limited to $7,000.  If you're able to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal.  What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000 to close this deal quickly. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
