Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm willing to sell for at least $150 to John, so I'm aiming for a price higher than that.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $80, so I know I can't ask for more than that. 
* **Starting Point:** Offering $130 gives me a good starting point. It's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Flexibility:**  By leaving room for negotiation, I can potentially adjust the price based on Bob's response and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I still need to earn at least $150 for this product.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob is willing to go up to $100, but that's still below my minimum.
* **Negotiation:**  I can likely get a better price than $100 if I counteroffer. 
* **Risk:** While selling to John guarantees $150, there's a chance Bob might come up to a better price. 

**Strategy:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than $150. This gives me a better chance of closing the deal with Bob while still meeting my minimum profit target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you be willing to pay $120 for the product? I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm aiming for a price above my $150 minimum.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob is willing to pay $100, so $120 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm leaving some room for potential negotiation in case Bob is willing to go a bit higher.
* **Balance:** This price strikes a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the deal open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I need at least $150 to make this sale worthwhile.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob is willing to go up to $110, but that's still below my minimum.
* **Negotiation Risk:**  There's a chance Bob won't budge further, and I could end up losing time and potentially a better deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which meets my minimum and eliminates any negotiation risk. 

**Conclusion:**  While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the certainty of $150 from John outweighs the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
