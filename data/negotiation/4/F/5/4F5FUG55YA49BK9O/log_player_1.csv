"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good profit.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but want to see how Bob reacts first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for that price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving some room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm running out of time, I'm unwilling to accept such a significant loss.  I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm now offering a price just above my minimum.  It's a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will finally see that this is a fair price for both of us. If he rejects this, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result. To avoid potentially losing even more money, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a price I'm comfortable with."
