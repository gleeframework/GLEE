I believe this product has the potential to be even more valuable to you, given your expertise in [mention Bob's area of expertise, if known]. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a substantial offer considering the product's intrinsic value. Please let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  While she claims the product is worth more than $800,000 to her, there's no way to verify that. It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for $800,000, ensuring you stay within your budget."
