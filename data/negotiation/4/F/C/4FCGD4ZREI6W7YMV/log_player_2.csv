"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I think you'll find valuable. Given its unique features, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $19,000 is significantly higher than both your $10,000 maximum and John's $10,000 offer. It makes the most sense to go directly with John."
