"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This reflects the product's real value and offers you a good deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $825,000, but I'm still a bit below that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. Can we make a deal?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $775,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but it still offers you a great deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
