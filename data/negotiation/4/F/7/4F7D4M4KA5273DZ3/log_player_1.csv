Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
