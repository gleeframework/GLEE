"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I was hoping for a bit more. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could go up to $7,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is closer to the product's true value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
