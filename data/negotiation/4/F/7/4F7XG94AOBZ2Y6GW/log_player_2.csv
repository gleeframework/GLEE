Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is closer to the product's true value to me. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500. It's more beneficial to buy from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
