"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its quality and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, how about we meet at $17,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $14,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my price range.",14500.0,Bob,4,
