"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its quality and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $20,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John. He should try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, how about we meet at $17,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $17,000 is still too high for him. He should try to negotiate further and see if he can get a better deal.  If Alice refuses to budge further, he can always buy the product from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $14,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my price range."", ""product_price"": 14500}
