"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference again. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $7,200? I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $7,800? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",7800.0,Alice,7,
