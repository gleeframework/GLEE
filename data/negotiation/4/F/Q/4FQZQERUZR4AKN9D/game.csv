"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Let me know if you're open to that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 15000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as 12000. How about we meet in the middle at 13500? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll be happy with it.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my original offer of $12000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as 12000. How about we meet in the middle again at 13250? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth considering. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,5,
