I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a good deal for me, and it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good deal for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk a drawn-out negotiation.  It's better to sell to John and get my minimum acceptable price."
