"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105.  This still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
