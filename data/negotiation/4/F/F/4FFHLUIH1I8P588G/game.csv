"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $1,300,000 is closer to our target, I'm still unable to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which I believe fairly reflects both our respective valuations. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
