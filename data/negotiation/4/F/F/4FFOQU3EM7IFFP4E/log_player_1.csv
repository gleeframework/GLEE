Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $925,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation gives you room to negotiate while still aiming for a significant profit. A price like $925,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still netting you a considerable gain. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as you can sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
