"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and also shows Bob that I believe the product is worth a lot. I'll see how he reacts and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price.  I still have 9 rounds to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $1,100,000, which is much closer to my desired price. With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing this deal and settling for the minimum with John. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
