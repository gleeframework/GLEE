,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm happy to pay $150 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $165, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $157.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",157.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not sure I can go quite that low. I can do $162.50, which is still a good deal for you, but also reflects the value I think the product brings to the table.",162.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $162.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $159.  That would be a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",159.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $161, which is just a dollar more than your last offer. Let's see if we can shake on it.",161.0,Alice,7,
