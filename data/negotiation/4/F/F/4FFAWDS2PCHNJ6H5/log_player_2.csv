"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $110. This is a great opportunity to get a deal on something you value highly. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget, Bob. I'm glad we're able to discuss this. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $107.50. I hope this works for you, and I look forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107.50 is within your budget and a reasonable compromise. It's only slightly higher than your counteroffer of $105, and you'd save $2.50 compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal if you keep negotiating, and it's worth accepting a price you're comfortable with."
