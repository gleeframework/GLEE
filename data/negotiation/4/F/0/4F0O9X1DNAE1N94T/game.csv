"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering your own value for it and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still beyond my ideal price point. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, which is $1,150,000. I'm confident that this price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the sale. Let's make it happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
