Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, let's say I'm willing to sell it for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
