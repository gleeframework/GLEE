Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's estimated value ($12,000). This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially get a good price.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** I'm leaving room for potential counteroffers from Bob and further negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale above his perceived value.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter with a new offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to his perceived value than my initial offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Leveraging John:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 allows me to hold out for a better price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. This will involve a counteroffer, potentially leading to a back-and-forth negotiation until I reach a satisfactory price or decide to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise given the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that I believe the product has value.
* **Moderate Adjustment:**  The $500 increase from Bob's offer is a relatively small adjustment, increasing the chances of Bob accepting while still allowing me to get closer to my target price.
* **Positioning for Success:** By moving towards the middle ground, I'm increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation without risking losing Bob completely.  I can still go lower if necessary, but this counteroffer aims to create momentum."
