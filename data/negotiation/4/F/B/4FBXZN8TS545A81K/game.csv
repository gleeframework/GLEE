"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your initial price, I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is already a competitive price considering the value this product offers. To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my ability to purchase from John. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,075,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to close this deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
