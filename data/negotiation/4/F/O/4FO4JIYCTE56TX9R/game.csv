,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a good price for you and gets me closer to my target.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I value our negotiation, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  This would give us both a fair deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
