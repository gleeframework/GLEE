"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000. Let's meet in the middle!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,000? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
