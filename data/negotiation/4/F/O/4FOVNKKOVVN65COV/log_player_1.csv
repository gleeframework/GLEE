"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive, reminding him that the price is still lower than his perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message signals that I am open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially enter a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** While Bob is clearly trying to get a lower price, he's still interested in the product. There's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is a backup option:**  While $10,000 from John is a safe option, I can potentially get a better deal from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by dropping from $13,000 to $11,000.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the significant value he'll receive, making the price seem more appealing.
* **Emphasis on Middle Ground:**  I suggest meeting in the middle, creating a sense of fairness and prompting Bob to consider a counteroffer closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,000? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob has now reached that point.
* **No significant room for further negotiation:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, the likelihood of success is low.  Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, but he's now at his limit.
* **Time is a factor:**  There are only 6 rounds remaining. Accepting the offer now ensures I get my minimum price, and I avoid the risk of further rejection and losing time. 
* **Selling to John is a safe alternative:**  While selling to John offers the same price, accepting Bob's offer demonstrates a successful negotiation and potentially opens the door for future business."
