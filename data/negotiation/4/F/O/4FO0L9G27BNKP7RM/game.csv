"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm definitely interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $9,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm still excited about the potential of this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $10,000. If you're interested in making this deal, let me know.  If not, I'll need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $10,800. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10800.0,Alice,5,
