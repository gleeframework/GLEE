Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's perceived value to Bob ($150).** This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers.**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below your desired profit margin. You can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. How about we meet at $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 away from your previous offer. This is a relatively small difference, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result.  Moreover, considering that John is only offering $80, accepting Bob's offer ensures a higher profit and a successful sale."
