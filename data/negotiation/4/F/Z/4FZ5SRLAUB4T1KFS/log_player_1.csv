Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000), but it's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and consider the risk of losing him as a buyer.  It's important to remember that John is always a backup option, guaranteeing a sale at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  John is always a viable option, so there's no pressure to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with.  Bob's offer shows he's not willing to budge much further, and I'm confident that John will purchase the product for $15,000. It's time to move on to a guaranteed sale."
