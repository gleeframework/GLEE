"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, given the value it holds for you. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, knowing I can potentially lower the price in later rounds.
* **Option to Walk Away:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any point, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** While $950,000 is a good deal, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have multiple rounds remaining and can still make a counteroffer.  
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup option with John for a higher price, so I'm not pressured to accept a significantly lower price this early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by making a counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm suggesting a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the price as fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Moving Forward:**  I'm emphasizing that accepting this offer would allow us to move forward with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still constrained by my budget. Could we possibly meet at $960,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still making a reasonable offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still relatively early in the negotiation and have several rounds left. I believe there's still room to increase the price.
* **Close to My Minimum:** While $960,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, I'm not willing to accept a price significantly below it yet.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale for $1,200,000 with John, which gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I can make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $965,000, which is closer to your offer and still a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by making a counter-offer close to his offer.
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This signals a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as fair considering the value the product brings to Bob.
* **Finalizing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the potential for closing the deal. 

**Strategy:**

* I am moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. 
* My counteroffer is a signal that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still not desperate to accept a lower price.
* I'm using a friendly and accommodating tone to build rapport and encourage a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again, and I believe we could reach an agreement at $960,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer hasn't budged from $960,000, and it's unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, the chances of reaching a significantly higher price with Bob are dwindling.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, which is considerably higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum desired price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob and ensures a higher profit.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, the remaining rounds with Bob are unlikely to yield a better outcome. Therefore, selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision."
