"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This ""anchors"" the negotiation higher, giving me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a great deal.
* **Justification:**  I frame the high price with a focus on the product's ""value and potential."" This avoids directly stating it's worth that much to *him* but emphasizes its inherent worth. 
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, which is crucial in multi-round bargaining. This prevents an immediate deadlock and encourages Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. It's still significantly higher than his perceived value, and I have plenty of rounds remaining. I'll counter with a price closer to my target, aiming to steer the negotiation in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, but $1,800,000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product.  To find a middle ground, I propose $2,100,000. This reflects its true potential while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and his perspective on the market. This shows I'm listening and taking his input into consideration.
* **Hold Firm (For Now):** While I'm moving closer to his price, I'm not drastically dropping my ask.  This signals that I'm serious about the higher value.
* **Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the product's ""unique aspects"" and ""true potential,"" reinforcing that my price is rooted in its value.
* **Compromise:** By proposing $2,100,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. The decrease shows flexibility, but the amount keeps me firmly above both his offer and my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I still think $1,800,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's clear that Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than my target. At this point, it's in my best interest to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
