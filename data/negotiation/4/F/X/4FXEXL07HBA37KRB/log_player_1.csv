Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,030,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds his initial offer by a significant margin and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds.  It's always possible to make more, but holding out for too long might backfire. This offer represents a good balance between profit and deal security."
