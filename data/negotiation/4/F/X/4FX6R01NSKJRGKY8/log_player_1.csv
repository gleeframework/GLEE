{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to him, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is lower than what I want, it's still close to my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, considering the value of this product to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum price of $800,000. It's a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a sale to John at the lower price."
