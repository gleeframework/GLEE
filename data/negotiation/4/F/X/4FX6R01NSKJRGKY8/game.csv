"Hi Alice, $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, considering the value of this product to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
