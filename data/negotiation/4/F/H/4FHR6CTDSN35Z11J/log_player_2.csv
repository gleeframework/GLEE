"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's significantly more than John's offer and above my budget.  I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to  $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer to give myself room for negotiation. It's important to leave space to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Polite and Clear:** My message is respectful of Alice's time and states my interest while being clear about my budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is your budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept that. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still slightly above what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation. I'll try countering with a price closer to John's to see if I can secure a better deal with Alice before going with my backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm getting closer to my limit, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm aiming for a price point closer to John's offer ($8,000) while still acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. $7,000 splits the difference between her current offer ($8,500) and my previous counteroffer ($6,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):**  By saying I'm getting ""closer to my limit,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without being too aggressive. This might encourage Alice to consider my offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my bottom line. It's the same price John is offering, and there's no guarantee I can negotiate further with Alice. Accepting now secures the product at my target price."
