"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to  $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is your budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept that. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm getting closer to my limit, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is the best I can do.",8000.0,Alice,5,
