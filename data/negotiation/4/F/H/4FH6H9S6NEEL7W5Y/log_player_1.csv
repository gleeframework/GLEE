Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still yields a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. This price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with selling to John at her desired minimum price."
