"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still a good price point for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it's a much fairer starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from John's price. Let's see if we can push her further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $725,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Would you consider $775,000? This would be a fair compromise, giving you a significant discount while ensuring I receive a reasonable price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and it's not worth the risk of pushing her away. Buying from John for $800,000 is the safer option at this point."
