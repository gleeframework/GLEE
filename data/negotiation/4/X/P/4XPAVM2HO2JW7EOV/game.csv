"I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $150. Is this something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I think $60 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still think $75 is a bit too low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
