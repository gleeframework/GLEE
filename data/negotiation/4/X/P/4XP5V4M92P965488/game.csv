"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need something closer to the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle at $750,000. This reflects both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $500,000 and $750,000, which would be $625,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $625,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit below the true value of the product.  Let's try $675,000. This offer is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs and allows us to finalize this deal.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $675,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this revised offer?",650000.0,Bob,6,
