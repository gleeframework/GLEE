"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which makes the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Value Statement:** I'm highlighting the product's value to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the price.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I aim to get Bob to make the first counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly. If the negotiations stall, I can always choose to sell to John for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit steep for me though. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product. I can still negotiate a more favorable price in the following rounds. 
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't improve.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed with the negotiation. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price.  I'll continue to assess Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $11,000 to $9,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting that my counteroffer is still fair. 
* **Negotiation Continuation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000 at this point. 

**Strategy:**

I'm strategically positioning myself to close the deal in the next few rounds. By offering a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm aiming to secure a profitable sale while still being open to negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $7,000. If you're able to meet me somewhere around there, I think we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. There's still room for a better offer.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation stalls.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'll aim to meet him somewhere in the middle, perhaps offering $8,000 or $8,500 in the next round.  I'll carefully assess Bob's responses to determine if he's serious about closing a deal at a price that's acceptable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers, and it brings us closer to an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $8,500, which is significantly closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my offer and make it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm showing that I'm serious about closing the deal and hoping that this counteroffer will lead to an agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price that is both profitable and acceptable to Bob. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250, and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still slightly below $10,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** We're on the brink of a deal. I can likely secure a better price with one more counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a Last Resort:** I'm nearing the end of the rounds, and selling to John for $10,000 is a viable option if this negotiation falls through.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price just below $10,000, such as $9,750, to try and close the deal without having to sell to John. If Bob rejects this final offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to a deal!  I'm willing to meet you at $9,750.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's finalize this and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my last counteroffer before potentially selling to John. I'm aiming to secure a price that's very close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make my offer seem more appealing.
* **Urgency and Finality:** I'm using language that emphasizes the closeness of a deal and the potential for it to fall apart if we don't reach an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to close the deal with this counteroffer. I'm demonstrating a commitment to finding a solution, but I'm also firm on my price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John and walk away from the deal."
