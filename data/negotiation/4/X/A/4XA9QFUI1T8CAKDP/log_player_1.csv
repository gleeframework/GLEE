Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,500, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price,  $9,000 is still a good deal and avoids the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
