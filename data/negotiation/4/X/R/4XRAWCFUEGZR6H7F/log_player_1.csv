"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a bold opening offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I want to see if I can secure a higher price right from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to settle for less than that.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's willingness to pay, but it still reflects the value of the product to me. I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to Bob, and we can finalize the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept his offer and finalize the deal. This ensures I get the minimum value I need for the product without risking further negotiation."
