"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good value for the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
