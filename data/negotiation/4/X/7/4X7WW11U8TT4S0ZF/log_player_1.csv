Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price point that is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation, emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I'm still aiming to keep the price at $10,000. This would allow me to fit the purchase into my current budget without straining it. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still holding firm at $10,000. While I'm not happy with this, I'm still determined to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can convince him to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer the product for $11,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going any lower.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
