"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110 is too high.
* **Alternative:**  John offers the product for $120, which is still within Bob's budget. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob opens the opportunity to negotiate a lower price. He can try to get closer to his desired price point, or at least get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, ideally getting closer to his $120 limit.
* **Alice's offer:** $110 is too high, but still within Bob's budget.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Start with a reasonable counteroffer that is below Alice's offer but not too far off.  $105 is a compromise, showing Bob is willing to negotiate but is still looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $115 is still too high, even though it's slightly lower than her previous offer.
* **Alternative:**  John still offers the product for $120. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation going, hoping to get a better price or at least get closer to his desired price point. He can also gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further before potentially deciding to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while securing the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $115 is still too high.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Since Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate (lowering her price from $110 to $115), Bob is willing to meet her halfway by offering $110. 
* **Alternative:** John's offer of $120 is still a possibility, but this counteroffer offers a chance to secure a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $112.5 is still above Bob's preferred price point but getting closer.
* **Alternative:**  John is still offering the product for $120, which is still within Bob's budget.

By rejecting the offer, Bob continues to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get an even better deal. It's possible to get closer to his $120 limit or potentially even a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $112.5 is still too high.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Alice seems to be willing to negotiate further. Bob is now offering $111, which is just a small step down from Alice's offer.  
* **Alternative:** John's offer is still a possibility but Bob is hopeful he can secure a lower price with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.8. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.8
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $112.8 is slightly lower than her previous offer but still within Bob's budget. 
* **Alternative:** John's offer is for $120, which is more expensive. 

Considering only three rounds left, the negotiation is reaching its end. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price slightly lower than John's, and  it's unlikely Alice will lower her offer significantly in the remaining rounds. This offer is a good compromise."
