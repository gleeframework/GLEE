# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to take a closer look at! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  This product sounds great. However,  I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?  I'm really interested in this item, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $11000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that she might reject my next counteroffer, and I'd end up buying from John at $12,000. It's better to secure the product for $11,000 rather than risk a higher price."
