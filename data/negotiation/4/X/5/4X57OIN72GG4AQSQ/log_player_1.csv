"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and I know you'll find it extremely valuable. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the benefit to Bob of getting the product at a lower price than what it's worth to him.
* **Positive tone:** I use positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

This is a strategic starting point that balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep the negotiation going."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to push for a higher price.  John's offer provides a safety net, giving me the flexibility to be more assertive with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Consider this: I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a significant discount for you, but it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's concerns:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations, showing that I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Highlight the discount:** I emphasize that my counteroffer is still a substantial discount compared to my own valuation and John's offer.
* **Collaborative approach:** I use language that suggests a willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution. 

This approach aims to maintain a positive and constructive dialogue while pushing for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1,300,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach an agreement. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** I reiterate that Bob's offer is still too low.
* **Compromise with a slight concession:**  I propose a price that's midway between our last offers, showcasing a willingness to compromise but not conceding too much.
* **Urgency and opportunity:** I add a sense of urgency by suggesting that we shouldn't miss this opportunity.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between being firm and flexible, encouraging Bob to come closer to my desired price without risking a complete stalemate."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get concerned that I might need to explore other options.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. If you're truly interested, this is our last chance to come to an agreement.  If not, I'll be moving on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:** I emphasize that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness:** I reiterate the fairness of the price, emphasizing that it benefits both parties.
* **Alternative options:** I subtly remind Bob that I have other options if he's unwilling to accept the offer.

This approach aims to put pressure on Bob, highlighting the potential for a deal to fall through if he doesn't accept this final offer.  This tactic helps push Bob to make a decision and potentially come closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at his initial offer of $1,200,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've made significant concessions during the negotiation, and it's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.  

Given John's offer of $1,500,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John.  It guarantees me the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower final price or a failed deal altogether."
