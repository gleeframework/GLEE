While $100 is a good deal, I can likely get it for less. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

$95 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to John's offer. I'm comfortable accepting this offer and closing the deal."
