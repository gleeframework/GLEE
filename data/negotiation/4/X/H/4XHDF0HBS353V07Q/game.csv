"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me. However,  $7,500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? I'm really interested in this product and believe we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $7,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,250 is still a bit more than I can afford at the moment.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,125?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",7125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $7,200. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll sell the product to you for $7,200. This is my final offer.",7200.0,Alice,5,
