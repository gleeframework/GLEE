"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $862,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $862,500 is still a little lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and settle on $868,750. This price reflects the value we both see in this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",868750.0,Alice,5,
