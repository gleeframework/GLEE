"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us -  you get a valuable asset at a price well below its worth to you, and I get a quick and efficient sale. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value our potential partnership, I can't go as low as $900,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This gives you a substantial savings and still allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price, $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to reach a more acceptable point. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. That's my final offer.",980000.0,Bob,6,
