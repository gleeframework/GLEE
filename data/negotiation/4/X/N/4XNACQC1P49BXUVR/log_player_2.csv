"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget:** You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $900,000.
* **John's offer is your fallback option:** While John's price is higher, it's still within your budget. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price with her or simply purchase from John."
