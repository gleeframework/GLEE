"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to pay $8200 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8800. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. I think we're close, and I'd like to see if we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
