"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to pay $8200 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,200, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. I think we're close, and I'd like to see if we can meet at a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement. I'm also starting to run out of rounds. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000. While it's not my ideal price, it guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
