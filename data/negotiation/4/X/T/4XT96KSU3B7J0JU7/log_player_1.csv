Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $700000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe the product is worth more than $700,000 and I'm willing to hold out for a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
