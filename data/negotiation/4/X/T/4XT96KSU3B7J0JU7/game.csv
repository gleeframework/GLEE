"Hi Alice,  $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $700000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit,  how about $850000?  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your constraints. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only go up to $800000.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,
