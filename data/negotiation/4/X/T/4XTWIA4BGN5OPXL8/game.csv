"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to come down to $120. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
