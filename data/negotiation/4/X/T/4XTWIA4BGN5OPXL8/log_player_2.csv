"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  You should definitely reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message expresses interest while clearly stating your price limit. This avoids wasting time with offers Alice is unlikely to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, you aim to move the negotiation closer to your desired price range. Remember, you always have the option of going to John for $100 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to come down to $120. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down on her price, $120 is still more than you want to spend and more than John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That seems fair for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  You're suggesting a price directly in between her current offer ($120) and your previous offer ($80). This is a common negotiation tactic and can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Reaching Your Limit:** This offer matches your maximum budget and John's offer. You're communicating that this is the highest you're willing to go. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** You're keeping the tone positive and appreciative of her willingness to negotiate. This helps maintain a good rapport even if she rejects this offer."
