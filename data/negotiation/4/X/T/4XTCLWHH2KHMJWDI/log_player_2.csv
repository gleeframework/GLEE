Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, however, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $750,000 is simply too low. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to accept $950,000.  This is a significant concession on my part and reflects the true value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, finding a middle ground is important. I'm glad we're moving closer to an agreement.  To be completely transparent, $900,000 is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this price reflects the product's value while still offering you a strong return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down significantly, but she's holding firm at $900,000.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
