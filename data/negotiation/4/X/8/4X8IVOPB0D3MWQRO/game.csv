"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I value this product highly, and while I'm open to negotiation, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  Let's try $1000000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
