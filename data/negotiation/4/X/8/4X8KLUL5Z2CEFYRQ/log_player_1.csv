Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible outcome.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident that the value of the product to Bob is greater than $800,000, so I believe there's a chance he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get more. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get him closer to my $1 million asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $950,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still value the product highly. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm ready to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly higher than John's offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and conclude the negotiation."
