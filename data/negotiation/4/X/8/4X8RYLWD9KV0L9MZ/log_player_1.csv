I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, $1,450,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can reach a deal in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than what John is offering.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm happy to move forward with the sale."
