"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to buy a fantastic product for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. He should reject and try to negotiate further.  While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is now higher than Bob's maximum budget. There's a good chance further negotiation won't bring the price down. It's better to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $8,000."
