"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point of $120. You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  It's always worth exploring your options and negotiating before resorting to the ""safe"" option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for getting back to me, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain my profit margin. How about $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, or you could run out of rounds before reaching an agreement.  It's a good deal for you, so accepting it is the best course of action."
