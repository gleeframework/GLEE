"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135.",135.0,Alice,3,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,6,

"I've already met you at $125 in the previous round, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $130, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that normally costs $20. So, the total value is now $150, but I'll sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $130. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the free accessory. Can you meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $130, Bob. I'm starting to think that we're at an impasse. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll throw in another free accessory that normally costs $30, making the total value $180. I'll sell it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional accessories you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $140. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the two free accessories. This is my final offer.",130.0,Bob,10,
