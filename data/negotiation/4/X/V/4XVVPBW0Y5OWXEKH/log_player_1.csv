"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the benefits for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, and allows me to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Not desperate:** While $1,500,000 from John is a guaranteed option, I'm not desperate to sell immediately.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a great opportunity. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price slightly from the initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to make my price seem more reasonable.
* **Collaborative Approach:**  I use phrases like ""work together"" and ""benefits us both"" to build rapport and create a sense of partnership.
* **Still above my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but $1,400,000 is still below my target.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's still a chance I can push for a higher price, especially with a few rounds left.
* **Not Taking Risks:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I'm not willing to settle for less if I can avoid it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While I value our ongoing discussion, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential return on investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  By suggesting a price in the middle, I show a strong desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I subtly remind Bob of the product's value, reinforcing why the price is justified.
* **Focusing on ROI:**  I appeal to Bob's business sense by mentioning ""return on investment,"" making the price seem more attractive. 
* **Last Chance:** This is likely my last counteroffer before considering John's offer, adding a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered our previous discussions, and I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,425,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still not high enough.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially getting a worse deal is too high.
* **Guaranteed Offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is a sure thing, guaranteeing me my minimum price and eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiations. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because it minimizes the risk and ensures I get a price that meets my minimum requirements."
