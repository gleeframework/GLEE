# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price.

It's getting risky to push further. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while you could likely negotiate a little lower, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her walking away. Accepting at $765,000 secures a good deal for you."
