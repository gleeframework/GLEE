"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $75?  I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the offer!  $75 is a little lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference at $82.50? I think that's fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
