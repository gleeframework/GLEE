"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair middle ground, but $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $975,000? I believe that's a reasonable compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this now. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
