"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle - I'll come down to $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,250,000.  Would you consider $1,400,000?  This feels like a fair offer considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that $1,400,000 is getting closer to a sweet spot, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle again, at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
