"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already compromised a lot on the price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

"I'm getting close to walking away from this deal, Bob. I've already given you a great deal with the bonus package, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional bonus, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, and I'll even throw in an additional $50 of my own as a gesture of good faith. Can we meet in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,10,
