"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. You are looking to pay no more than $8,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  Rejecting the offer will give you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000. Let's start with a price of $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500.  This still gives you a good deal, considering what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $8,000.  You should reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $9,250.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is still above your target price of $8,000. You have already rejected her previous offer and made a counteroffer. The negotiations are getting close, but it is unlikely that Alice will budge further.  It is best to move on to the other seller, John, who is willing to sell you the product for your desired price."
