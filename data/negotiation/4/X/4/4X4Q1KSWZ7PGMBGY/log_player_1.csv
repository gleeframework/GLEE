"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also framing it as a good deal for him, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000. Let's start with a price of $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that low, and I want to see if I can get closer to my goal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500.  This still gives you a good deal, considering what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my goal, it's still not ideal. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with continued negotiation. I will see if I can get Bob to move higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $9,250.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
