"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows he can get the product for $12,000 from John, so he starts by offering a price slightly higher than that. This shows good faith while still trying to get the best price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible. While $13,500 is better than $14,000, it's still more than his goal of $12,000.  He can get the product from John for that price, so rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price but still trying to get a better deal. He offers $13,000 as a compromise, hoping to meet halfway. It's higher than his target but lower than Alice's current offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still saving money."
