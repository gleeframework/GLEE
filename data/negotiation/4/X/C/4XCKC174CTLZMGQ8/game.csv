"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $600,000. Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept it at $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a great value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair price and hope we can make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
