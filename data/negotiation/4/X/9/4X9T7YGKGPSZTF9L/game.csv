"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting it for a significant discount from its true value, and I'll get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $12,000 to $10,500, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
