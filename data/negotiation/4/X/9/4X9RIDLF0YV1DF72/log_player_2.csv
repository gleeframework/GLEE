"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, it's truly one of a kind.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest,  the product's worth to me is closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob considering John's price of $12,000.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, it's risky, and accepting this offer ensures he gets the product for a decent price. There's always the chance that Alice might become stubborn and refuse to go lower, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
