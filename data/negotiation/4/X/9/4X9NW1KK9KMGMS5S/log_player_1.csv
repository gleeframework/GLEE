I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm getting a good price for the product. I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting my counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price expectations. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
