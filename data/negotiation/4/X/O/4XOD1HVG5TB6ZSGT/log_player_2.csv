``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good price, you can likely get it lower.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I respect your decision. In light of this, I am proposing a revised price of $725,000 for the product. I believe this still offers significant savings for you while ensuring a fair return for us. I hope we can find a solution that works for both parties.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a significant saving compared to John's price of $800,000. While there's always a chance you could get it lower, the risk of further negotiation may not be worth it.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option to secure the product at a good price."
