Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer sets a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to try and earn more than the minimum $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $90 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get $100 for the product, Bob's offer of $90 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
