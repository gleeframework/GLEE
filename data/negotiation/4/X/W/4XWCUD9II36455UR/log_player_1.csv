Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to potentially negotiate down if needed, while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product! While it looks great, $130 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher profit. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget, $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I'd be willing to go up to $105 if that works for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $105 is a better price than Bob's initial offer, I'm still not satisfied with the profit.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
