It's time to cut your losses. Alice is clearly very attached to that $920,000 mark, and you're running out of rounds to negotiate. Buying from John for $1,000,000 might be a little less ""ideal"", but it guarantees you the product and avoids the risk of Alice pushing the price even higher in the last round."
