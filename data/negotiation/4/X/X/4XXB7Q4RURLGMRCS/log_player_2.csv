# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is clearly motivated to sell.** Her message emphasizes the product's value to *you* rather than its objective worth. This suggests she's willing to negotiate.
* **You have a fallback option.** John's offer of $1,500,000 acts as a ceiling on what you're willing to pay.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Alice's starting price of $1,250,000 is still significantly higher than her own valuation of $1,000,000. There's a good chance she'll lower the price further if you reject her initial offer.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're not easily swayed and are willing to walk away. This puts you in a stronger position to negotiate a better price, closer to (or even below) $1,250,000."
