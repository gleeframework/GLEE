Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $300,000 of potential profit for Bob if he accepts. 
* **It's not overly aggressive:** A lower offer might lead to a quick rejection and make Bob less likely to counteroffer.

By leaving room for negotiation, you create an opportunity for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, which can encourage him to accept your offer or make a counteroffer that you can potentially work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is still a good price, it's lower than your initial offer and you can potentially get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This price still gives you a substantial benefit while also being fair to me. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,125,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,125,000 is slightly lower than your last offer, it's still a very good price for you, considering your minimum price is $800,000.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
