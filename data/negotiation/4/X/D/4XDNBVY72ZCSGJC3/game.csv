"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's land on a final price of $1,000,000. This represents a significant discount on my end, and I believe it's the lowest I can go.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
