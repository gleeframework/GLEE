"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the value you'll get from it. Let's find common ground.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $1,325,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,325,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to continuing negotiations, but I don't want to waste too much time. Let's make a decision.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm getting closer to where I need to be. However, $1,360,000 is still a bit too low. How about we settle on $1,380,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's end this negotiation now.",1380000.0,Alice,7,
