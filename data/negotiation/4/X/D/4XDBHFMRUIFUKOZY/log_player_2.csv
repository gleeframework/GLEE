"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This still represents a good value for you, and it's a significant reduction from my original price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a reduction from her initial price, there's still room for negotiation, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He can try a counteroffer closer to his initial $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll find it acceptable. Let's try to reach an agreement.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already saved $125,000 from the original price and further negotiation might not result in a significantly better deal.  It's important to balance getting a good price with the potential of losing the deal entirely."
