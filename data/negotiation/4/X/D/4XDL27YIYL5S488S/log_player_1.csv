Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking for a buyer who recognizes its value. I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to me (Alice), the message hints at its high value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in discussion.
* **Backup Plan:**  Since I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, I can afford to be a bit bolder with my initial offer to Bob."
