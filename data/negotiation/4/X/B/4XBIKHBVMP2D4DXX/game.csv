"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be useful, $22,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I see the value this brings you, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. Could we settle somewhere around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - how about $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working to find a compromise. However, $14,000 is still more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
