Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal, as it's well below the market value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000).** This gives Bob incentive to accept the offer and still make a profit.

By starting with this offer, you open the negotiation with a strong position, while still leaving room for compromise and potentially getting a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you have a better chance of getting a higher price by continuing the negotiation. Here's why:

* **You have more leverage:**  You know Bob is interested in the product and willing to pay a significant amount. 
* **You can use John as a bargaining chip:** If the negotiations with Bob fall through, you can always sell to John. This gives you a safety net and lets you be more assertive in your counteroffers. 
* **There's room for compromise:** Bob's offer is a good starting point for a counteroffer. You can offer a price slightly higher than his offer but still lower than your initial offer, increasing your chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise, but not willing to sell at a price that significantly undervalues the product.
* **Is lower than your initial offer:**  This keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows you're open to finding a middle ground. 
* **Offers a good deal for Bob:** He can still make a profit on the product, considering its worth to him.

This counteroffer keeps you in control of the negotiation while still offering Bob a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is only $50,000 higher than John's offer, it's still a better deal for me.  Here's why:

* **Time is money:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on, and there's no guarantee Bob will be willing to come up further. 
* **Potential for delays:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might walk away completely, leaving me with John's lower offer.
* **Limited upside:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price from Bob, the $50,000 gain isn't worth the risk of losing the deal.

It's important to be practical and recognize when a good deal is a good deal.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a sale above my minimum acceptable price and avoids further uncertainty."
