I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a price above my minimum of $1,500,000. I'm confident that if Bob rejects, I can still get a good deal with John as a backup.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'll counteroffer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a good compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product highly. Hopefully, Bob will find this offer reasonable and we can close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,850,000 is a good price, exceeding my minimum and getting me closer to my initial goal. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Bob walking away completely or further lowering his offer is real.  It's time to take the deal and secure the sale!"
