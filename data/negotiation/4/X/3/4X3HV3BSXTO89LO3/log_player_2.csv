"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $110 is too high for Bob, as he's willing to pay a maximum of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming to pay as little as possible, so he starts with a lower price than Alice's offer.
* **Balance:** $95 is a reasonable starting point, it's a significant discount from Alice's offer but also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and emphasizes Bob's interest in the product while still conveying his firm stance on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $102.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $102.50 is still more than Bob's ideal price. He's looking for a deal below $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Alice is showing flexibility, there's still room to push for a lower price. 
* **Avoiding John:** Bob should avoid buying from John unless absolutely necessary, as that would cost him the most."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $102.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to close the deal at $98.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to push:** Bob is persistent in getting a lower price, but he's also getting closer to Alice's last offer.
* **Small increment:** By offering $98, Bob is showing flexibility while keeping the pressure on Alice. 
* **Positive message:**  The message remains polite and focused on finding a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $99.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not there yet:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, $99.50 is still slightly higher than his ideal price.
* **Still room for negotiation:** Bob can likely get Alice to come down a bit more. 
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is still a less desirable option, as Bob can potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm almost there.  $99.50 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. Let's split the difference and go with $99.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 99} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** Bob is now very close to his target price and is making a final push to close the deal.
* **Compromise:**  Offering $99 shows willingness to compromise while still getting a good deal.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning closing the deal immediately adds a bit of pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to give up on a higher price, Bob. How about we meet at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable price:** $100 is within Bob's budget and only slightly above his ideal price. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Alice is likely to be firm on this price, and further negotiation could lead to more rounds and a higher final price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting this offer risks Alice changing her mind or losing the deal to another buyer. 
* **Time constraint:**  While Bob has a few rounds left, it's better to secure the deal now and avoid potential complications."
