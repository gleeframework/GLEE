"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still above my target.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, and I believe it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000 again, but this time I'm not budging any further. I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
