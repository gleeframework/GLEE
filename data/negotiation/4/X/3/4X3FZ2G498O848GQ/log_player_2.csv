"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. As Bob, I aim to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above my target price. I'm aiming to acquire the product for as low as possible, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $1,050,000 is still too high. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm still within my budget and have plenty of rounds left to make a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still above my target.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, and I believe it allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000 again, but this time I'm not budging any further. I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $1,050,000 is her final offer. While this is still higher than my ideal price, it's closer to my target and within my budget. Continuing negotiations could result in further deadlock and potentially lead me to buy from John at a significantly higher price. 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price within my budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
