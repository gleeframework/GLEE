Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.
