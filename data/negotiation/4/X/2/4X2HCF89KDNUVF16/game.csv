,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12000? That way, we both walk away happy.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back and forth. While I'm open to negotiation, $11500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm firm on $11800. If you're serious about buying, I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit further. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try to get a bit closer to my target price? Could you meet me at $11200? That would be a great deal for me.",11200.0,Bob,6,
