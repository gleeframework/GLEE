Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5

Round 7

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very attached to a price point above $1,075,000.  We've been going back and forth with small increments, and she's not budging significantly. At this point, we're only in round 9, but it's unlikely we'll see a substantial drop from Alice in the last round.  

While buying from John means we don't get a discount, it's better to secure the product for $1,500,000 than risk Alice remaining above our acceptable price range in the final round."
