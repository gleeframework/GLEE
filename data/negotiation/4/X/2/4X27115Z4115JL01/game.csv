"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $16,000 is a good starting point, but I need a bit more to make it work for me. How about $17,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,500 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16500.0,Bob,4,
