"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming to maximize profit and know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Starting high leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's ""potential value"" and ""significant benefits"" subtly reinforces its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room:** By offering a price $100,000 below Bob's perceived value, we create a sense that a deal is possible, encouraging him to counter instead of walking away.

This strategy sets a strong starting point while remaining within a reasonable range of Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below Bob's known valuation and our initial asking price. Bob's mention of ""market value"" might be a negotiation tactic. We have room to negotiate further and should aim higher. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving a potential $150,000 on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages that go beyond those comparisons.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of what you're gaining."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Countering:** We acknowledge Bob's point about market value but reiterate the product's unique strengths, subtly devaluing his comparison.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a $50,000 concession, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer. 
* **Framing:**  By stating we are ""willing to come down,"" we imply flexibility but maintain a strong position. The phrase ""true value"" reinforces the idea that our price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,025,000 is a significant profit margin, exceeding our minimum and representing a successful negotiation.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's framing of ""meeting halfway"" suggests a strong desire to close the deal, making it less likely he'll walk away easily.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield smaller gains while risking Bob's willingness to continue bargaining.  

While we could push for a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and settling for $800,000 with John is not worth the potential upside at this point."
