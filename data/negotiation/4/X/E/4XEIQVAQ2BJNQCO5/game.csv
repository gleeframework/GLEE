"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $950,000? This price still reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a reasonable sacrifice to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product and the fact that it's still well within my minimum acceptable price.  Let's close this deal.
