"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit of money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired range.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing Bob to potentially get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial offer of $10,500.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now at $11,000.** This is the same price as her initial offer in Round 1. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  While he'd prefer a lower price, he's already made several counteroffers and it's unlikely Alice will go lower. 
* **John is offering the product for $12,000.** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice for Bob in this round."
