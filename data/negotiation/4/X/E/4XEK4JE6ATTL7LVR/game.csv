"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] at a price that's significantly below its true value. While I'm confident I can secure a higher offer elsewhere, I'd like to give you a chance to own this valuable asset. My price is $1,750,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth to you. Please let me know your decision.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
