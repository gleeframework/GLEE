"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1200000. I would like to propose an alternative that better aligns with my financial situation. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, while also ensuring I get a decent profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Given my financial constraints, I am unable to agree to a price of $1100000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $950000. This price is closer to what I am comfortable with, while still reflecting the product's value to me. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Bob. I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me halfway. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
