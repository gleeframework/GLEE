"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  It's a good price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $88?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $90? It's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
