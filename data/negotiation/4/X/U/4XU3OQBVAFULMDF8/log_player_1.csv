Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by offering the product to Bob at a price slightly below his perceived value ($120) but significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This high starting point leaves space for potential counteroffers and negotiation while still aiming to secure a favorable deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware that I have the option to sell the product to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob are not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting immediately would leave potential profit on the table. I'll counter-offer in hopes of reaching a price point closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've reduced my asking price by $5, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This puts the offer roughly in the middle ground between our previous positions.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I place on the product and provides a good profit margin. 
* **Pressure Point:** By holding firm above $105, I'm signaling that I'm serious about the value and am prepared to walk away if necessary (especially since I have John as a backup buyer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $107.50 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by incrementally increasing his offer and suggesting a ""middle ground."" Accepting his offer of $107.50 is a strategic move for the following reasons:

* **Profitable Deal:** $107.50 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $100 and a reasonable compromise from my initial asking price.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation doesn't guarantee a better outcome and could delay the sale. Accepting now allows me to move forward."
