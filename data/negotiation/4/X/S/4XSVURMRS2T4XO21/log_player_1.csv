Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but still attractive to Bob, who values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $925,000 is my initial offer, the message implies I'm open to discussion, allowing Bob to feel he's getting a potentially better deal.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's value and justifies the high price.

This strategy balances securing the best possible price from Bob while acknowledging the risk of him rejecting the offer."
