Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm framing the offer in a way that emphasizes the benefit to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  The offer is not too aggressive, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation if Bob rejects it.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer and can always fall back to him if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There's still a gap between my minimum and Bob's offer, creating room for counteroffers.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so I can afford to be patient with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum but still appealing enough to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your business, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. The $9,500 price is a halfway point between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Maintaining a Margin:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but the offer is enticing enough to keep Bob interested.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefit for Bob, emphasizing the deal he's getting and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,500 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $3,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I might not get a better offer. There's always the chance that he might come back with a higher offer, but there's also the risk that he might not.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** I have the option of selling to John for $12,000, which gives me a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall through. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would ideally like to get closer to my target price, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most reasonable choice. It's a good deal for me, considering his initial value for the product, and it minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
