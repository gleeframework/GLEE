Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him room to negotiate, but still leaves me with a decent profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product offers Bob, making it more likely he'll accept. 

**Important Notes:**

* **John's Offer:**  Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any time. This gives me a safety net and a point of reference for my negotiations with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I will adjust my offers based on Bob's responses. If he rejects, I'll likely lower my price a bit, but never below my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that high right now. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is too low, it's a starting point for further negotiation.  I believe I can get a better price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I have the fallback option of selling to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose out.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I will likely start with a counteroffer slightly below my desired price of $12,000 to leave room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $9,500 is a compromise.  It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price, showing flexibility.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By starting slightly lower than my desired price, I leave room for further negotiation if necessary. 

**Important Notes:**

* **John's Offer:** I still have the option of selling to John for $12,000, so there's no risk of losing out entirely.
* **Bob's Response:** I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I may lower my price further, but I won't go below my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but it's not guaranteed.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort. 
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  There's a risk that Bob might walk away or find another seller. Accepting the offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current circumstances, accepting Bob's offer of $9,000 is the best option. It balances the potential for a higher price with the risks of further negotiation and the potential for losing the sale altogether."
