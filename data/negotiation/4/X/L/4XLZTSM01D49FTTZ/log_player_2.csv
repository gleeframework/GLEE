"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation to bring the price down further.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $950,000 but is still above her minimum value of $1,000,000. It signals my intention to negotiate seriously while leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $975,000 is a good compromise. It's still below my maximum value of $1,200,000, and accepting it saves me $25,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of getting a lower price, the risk of further negotiation might lead to Alice rejecting my offer, potentially resulting in a higher price or even losing the deal."
