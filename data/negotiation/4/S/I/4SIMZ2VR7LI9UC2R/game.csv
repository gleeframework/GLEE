"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this one. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to work with you.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $90 is close, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $80? That's the absolute most I can do.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $100. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $100? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,7,
