"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her valuation, it's still higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, Bob can try to push the price closer to John's $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A strong counteroffer helps understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.
* **Anchor the negotiation:**  By starting lower, Bob tries to shift the negotiation's midpoint closer to his desired price. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  While $900,000 is ideal, there's space for Bob to increase his offer if needed while staying below John's $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still more expensive than buying from John. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, I think."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is continuing to negotiate while staying below his maximum price from John. 

* **Compromise:** Offering $975,000 shows a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  While not explicitly stated, the presence of John's offer creates a natural time pressure. Alice might be more inclined to accept a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely. 
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:**  Continuously countering with small increments might stall the negotiation. A more significant jump towards Alice's price could encourage a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is reducing her price in smaller increments now. It's unlikely she will go much lower than $1,012,500. Since Bob has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point. The potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are likely to be minimal and not worth the risk of her withdrawing from the deal altogether."
