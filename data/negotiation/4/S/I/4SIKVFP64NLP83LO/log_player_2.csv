"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still quite high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  I'm starting with an offer closer to Alice's perceived value ($8,000) than my own ($10,000), but not so low that it's insulting. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** I've provided a friendly reason for my counteroffer (""meet in the middle"").
* **Goal:**  My goal is to secure a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to her perceived value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my last offer. How about $9,125?  That's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but we still have room to go down. Her offer of $9,125 is closer to her initial price than it is to our counter-offer. We can afford to push a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we settle at $8,900? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal."",
""product_price"": 8900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a more substantial concession this time, moving closer to Alice's price point.
* **Urgency:**  I've introduced a sense of urgency to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Target Price:**  My new offer keeps us below $9,000, which is a good compromise considering John's $10,000 alternative."
