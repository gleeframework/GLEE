"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as close to Bob's value of $15,000 as possible. This offer leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I get a good profit.  It's important to note that if Bob rejects this offer, I have the option to go with John's offer for $8,000, which guarantees me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round. I have 8 rounds left before I have to make the decision to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous round, but still staying above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away too much value. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, but it also allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer. While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's now within my acceptable range. I have several rounds left, and I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher. There's also a risk that I could continue negotiating and end up with John's offer of $8,000. I believe that accepting Bob's offer now is the best option, as it guarantees me a profit of $2,000."
