"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $850000 was too low, so I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900000 is too high, so I'll meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $862500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",862500.0,Alice,7,
