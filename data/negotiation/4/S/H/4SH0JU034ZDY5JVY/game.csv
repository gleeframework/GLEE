"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $115 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets me closer to my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $112. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",112.0,Alice,5,
