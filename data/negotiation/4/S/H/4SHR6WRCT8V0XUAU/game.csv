"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider something closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I could be flexible. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $90 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $70 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $80?",80.0,Alice,5,
