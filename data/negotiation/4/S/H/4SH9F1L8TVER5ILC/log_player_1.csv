Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11,500 is a fair price considering the market value. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $12,000 mark. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
