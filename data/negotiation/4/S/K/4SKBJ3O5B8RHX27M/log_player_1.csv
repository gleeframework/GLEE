{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my guaranteed value of $800,000 from John. 

By offering this price, I'm hoping to:

* **Maximize my profits:** If Bob accepts, I make an extra $100,000.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob rejects, it gives me valuable information about the product's potential value to him. I can then adjust my strategy accordingly."
