"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit. While Bob might find it a bit steep, it's a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that it's a great deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts, which encourages dialogue and potentially leads to a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me, and hopefully, it's a starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for better outcome:** I'm confident I can push for a higher price with further negotiation. 
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would secure my minimum, but I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Strategic counter-offer:** I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired outcome, aiming for a deal closer to $1,000,000 or above."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I'm looking for. Considering the unique value this product brings, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counter-offer:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still showing flexibility. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique value to justify the price, reminding Bob of its potential benefits. 
* **Concession and hope:** I'm framing my counter-offer as a significant concession, making it seem more appealing to Bob while also expressing optimism about a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a good middle ground between our numbers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Possibility of a better deal:**  I'm confident I can still push for a higher price with further negotiation. There's a good chance Bob is willing to go up a bit more, especially if he's genuinely interested in the product.
* **Potential for a counteroffer:** I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired outcome, aiming for a deal closer to $1,000,000 or above.
* **John as a backup:** While selling to John would secure my minimum, I'm committed to exploring all options before making a final decision.  

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate, I aim to maximize my profit while keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic compromise:** I'm making a significant concession by lowering my price to $1,050,000, showing flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, highlighting the value of the product and my willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Urgency and collaboration:**  I'm suggesting that we work together to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to take action. 
* **Last chance before John:** This offer is a clear signal that I'm close to my minimum acceptable price and will likely move forward with John if Bob doesn't accept.

This counteroffer aims to incentivize Bob to accept, making him aware of the potential for losing out on the deal while still remaining financially viable for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to get the product for $950,000. It's a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob has repeatedly rejected offers above his desired price of $950,000. This indicates that he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Risk of further rounds:** Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering my price and potentially reaching a deal below my minimum acceptable value.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price,  the risk of further negotiation and a potentially lower outcome outweighs the benefits.  Selling to John is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
