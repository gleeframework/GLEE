"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, after all!",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and I pay $110? ",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $125. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",125.0,Alice,5,
