"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it will bring to your business.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $15,500 is close, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $14,000? That's the highest I can go.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $15,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value and the benefits it will bring to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though - I'll offer it to you for $14,750. This is the best I can do.",14750.0,Alice,7,
