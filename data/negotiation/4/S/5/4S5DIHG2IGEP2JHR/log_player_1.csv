Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding our minimum price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above our $1,200,000 safety net with John.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning another offer creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
