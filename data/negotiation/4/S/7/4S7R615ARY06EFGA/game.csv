"Thanks for the offer Alice!  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. That's still a good profit for you, and it fits within my budget. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you considering your estimated value, and it gives me a fair profit. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,
