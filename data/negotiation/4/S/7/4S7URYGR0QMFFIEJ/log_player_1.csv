Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a reasonable starting offer. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I want to try to get closer to my desired price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will push Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my previous counteroffer and is closer to Bob's latest offer. It's a final attempt to reach an agreement before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear that Bob and I are unlikely to reach an agreement. While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to accept John's offer and secure a sale that meets my minimum requirement."
