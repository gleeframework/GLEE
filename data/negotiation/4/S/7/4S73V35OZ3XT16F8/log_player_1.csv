Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $170 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $170, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to keep Bob engaged.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm willing to discuss the price, which could lead to a deal.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the potential of getting a better price from John. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider lowering my price slightly but not going below my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While John is offering $150, I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $150. I'll need to assess how strongly Bob wants the product and how likely he is to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $140.  I think this price is fair considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Justify the Price:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  While I've lowered my price, I'm still above my minimum of $150, giving me some negotiating room if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully assess Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to:
    * Lower my price further (but not below $150)
    * Accept John's offer of $150
    * End the negotiation with Bob and try to find another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $140. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer and counter again, he might walk away or continue to push for a lower price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $150 guarantees me a profit and a quick sale.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get $140 or $150 from Bob, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoid any potential delays or losses."
