"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we start the conversation at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000.  This gives you a significant saving while still ensuring I get a fair price. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $900,000. Would you consider $940,000?",940000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. While $940,000 is tempting, it's still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - $970,000. This gives you a good price, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",970000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm happy to bump my offer up a bit to meet you.  How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
