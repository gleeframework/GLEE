"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is significantly higher than I had budgeted. I'd be willing to consider a purchase price closer to  $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your specific use case. To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate your willingness to come down on price, but that's still a bit rich for me.  To be frank, I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can go as high as $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible, but I also have a responsibility to ensure a fair deal. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe you're the ideal fit for this product. If you're willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000, we have a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That other offer certainly makes things interesting, but I need to hold firm on my budget.  If you're willing to accept $1,000,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
