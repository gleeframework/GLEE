Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $820,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
