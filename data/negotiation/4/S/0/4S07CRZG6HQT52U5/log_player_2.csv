"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so she's already asking for more than it's worth to her. $15,000 is way too high, so it's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is still slightly above your maximum, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. It shows that you're serious about buying the product but also that you're not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is a better offer than the initial $15,000, it's still above your maximum of $10,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and potentially pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your maximum price and Alice's last offer.  It shows you're willing to move a bit, but still firmly within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your maximum, but $13,500 is still too high. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This final counteroffer is a bit higher than your previous one but still within your budget and could potentially be acceptable to Alice, especially since she's already lowered her price several times. It's a last-ditch effort to secure a deal without going over your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still holding out for a price higher than your budget.  While $13,000 is closer to your maximum, it's not worth risking a potential stalemate.  It's better to secure the product at your desired price from John."
