Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a sense that we're both trying to find common ground.  Let's split the difference between our last offers - I'll accept $837,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business."", ""product_price"": 837500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find common ground, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $825,000, but I need to get closer to that. How about $830,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer of $830,000. While it's not ideal, it's close to my minimum and we're running out of rounds. There's a risk of getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers and losing the deal altogether."
