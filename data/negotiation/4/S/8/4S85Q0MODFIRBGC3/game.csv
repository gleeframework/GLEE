"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a higher price.  $800,000 is a bit low for the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $825,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting a sense that we're both trying to find common ground.  Let's split the difference between our last offers - I'll accept $837,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",837500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to find common ground, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $825,000, but I need to get closer to that. How about $830,000?",830000.0,Bob,6,
