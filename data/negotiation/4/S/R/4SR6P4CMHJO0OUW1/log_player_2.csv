**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, and I'm willing to pay $12,000.  I'm offering a price that's closer to her desired price, but still leaves room for her to make some profit. This should be a good starting point for negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is getting dangerously close to my maximum price of $12,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might keep pushing for a higher price, leaving me with a less favorable deal.  To ensure I secure the product within my budget and avoid further negotiation rounds, I'll buy from John for $12,000."
