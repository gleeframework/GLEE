It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 17.6% reduction.  This should give us some room to negotiate while still keeping the offer reasonable."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to raise my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal but still leaves room for further negotiation."

We're getting closer, but I still believe we can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer one more time and see if Alice is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 760000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $760,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but it's still lower than her latest offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is very close to my last counteroffer. We're at a point where further negotiation might not be fruitful, and I'm  risk of losing a good deal if I keep rejecting offers.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a decent price."
