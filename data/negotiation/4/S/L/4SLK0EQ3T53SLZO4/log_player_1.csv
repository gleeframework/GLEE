Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers incredible value, but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it just below this price maximizes potential profit from Bob.
* **Urgency and Value:**  The message implies there's another buyer (John) without explicitly saying so. This creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the value Bob would get by securing the deal quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer allows for some flexibility without going below the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
