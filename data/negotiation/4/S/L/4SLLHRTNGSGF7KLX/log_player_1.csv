Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm framing the message as an open invitation to discuss,  making Bob feel like he's part of the process. 

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob accepts, great! I've earned $120.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth negotiating further, or if I should just sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $95 is still higher than his perceived value of $80 but below my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe I can get closer to my minimum value by counteroffering.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a slight risk to potentially earn more. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $95 and $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm using an open-ended message to encourage further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to weigh my options:
    * Accept his offer of $95, as it's closer to my minimum. 
    * Sell to John for $100, if I'm not willing to go any lower."
