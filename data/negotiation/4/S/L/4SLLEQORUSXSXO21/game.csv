"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,375,000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I will need to consider selling to another buyer.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but no higher. I really like the product and would like to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
