"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $95? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference at $92.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $92.50, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we try $97.50? I think it's a fair compromise",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $95?  That way we both make a small compromise and get this deal done.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my desired price. How about we try $98? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I appreciate you meeting me at $95 earlier.  Let's try to finalize this.  How about $96?  It's just a small step away from our last agreement, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",96.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $98, Bob. I think this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to meet you at $98. Let's make a deal!",98.0,Alice,9,
