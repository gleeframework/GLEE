"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer for the product is $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this moment. I'm interested in the product, and I'm prepared to offer $12500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value I bring to the table. How about we meet at $13500? It's a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value it will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still hesitant to go above $13000.  Perhaps we can split the difference and settle on $13250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",13250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13250. I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price, but I need to think about the value I bring to the table. How about we meet at $14000? It's a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value it will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,7,
