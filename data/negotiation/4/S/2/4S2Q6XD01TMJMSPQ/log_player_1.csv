Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this matter considerable thought, and I believe a fair price for the product should be $15700. I hope this proposal aligns with your valuation.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum target of $12,000.  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price.  Rather than continue to haggle and potentially risk losing even more time, I will take the guaranteed offer from John for $12,000. It's not ideal, but it's a better outcome than risking a lower offer from Bob or running out of rounds without a deal."
