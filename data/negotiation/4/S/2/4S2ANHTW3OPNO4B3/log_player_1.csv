Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
