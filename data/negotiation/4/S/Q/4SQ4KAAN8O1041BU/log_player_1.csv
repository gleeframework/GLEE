Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum of $8,000, but still leaves room for Bob to get a good deal ($3,000 in savings). 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Maximizing profit:** This offer aims to maximize your profit while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Negotiation room:** By offering $12,000, you leave room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **John as a safety net:** You can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000 if Bob rejects your offer."
