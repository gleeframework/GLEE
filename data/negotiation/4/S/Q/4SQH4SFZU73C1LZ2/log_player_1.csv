"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. While it's tempting to take the $750,000, it's still below my minimum value. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's low offer and my minimum value. It also shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, hopefully encouraging Bob to come closer to my desired price point."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm not ready to sell for that price yet.  I think I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a further drop from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering Bob's increasing offers. I think this shows good faith and willingness to compromise, potentially encouraging Bob to make a final offer that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not ready to settle. I believe there's still potential for a better price. I'm confident I can get a better offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's steady increase in offers.  I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal and that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final offer that is closer to my desired price."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum value. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful sale and meets my minimum financial goal."
