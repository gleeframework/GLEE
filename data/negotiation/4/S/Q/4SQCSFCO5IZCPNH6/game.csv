"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not convinced that $10000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I can do better. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good compromise. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
