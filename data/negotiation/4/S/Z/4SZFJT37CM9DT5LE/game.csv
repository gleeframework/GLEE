"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I could do $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a steal for a product this good!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $9,500?  That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and the friendly negotiation. To be honest, $9,500 is quite a bit below what I was hoping for. How about we split the difference again and call it $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about $10,500? That's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,6,
