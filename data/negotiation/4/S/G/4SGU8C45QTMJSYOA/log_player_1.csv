Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this item which I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price slightly lower than your guaranteed amount ($149) allows room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle but ensures you don't go below your minimum. 
* **Encouraging a Quick Decision:** By presenting a ""take it or leave it"" price, you encourage Bob to act fast, knowing he might miss out if he hesitates."
