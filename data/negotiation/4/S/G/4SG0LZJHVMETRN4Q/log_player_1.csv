Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but lower than the value of the product for Bob ($120). This gives Bob a potential profit margin, making him more likely to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer for $90 is still a good deal for me. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and offers a reasonable profit. Proceeding to another round risks losing the sale altogether, so accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option in this scenario."
