"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which still leaves a healthy margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and allows both of us to benefit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
