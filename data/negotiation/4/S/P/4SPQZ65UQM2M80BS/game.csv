,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've suggested. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better price for the product. Would you be willing to consider $1200000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the $1200000 proposal. I am still committed to finding a price that works for both of us within my budget. I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $900000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at $1200000, or at least consider $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. Given the current market value and my budget constraints, I believe $1100000 might not be feasible. I am willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This proposal aims to respect the value you place on the item while also fitting within my financial limits.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to my minimum. Would you be willing to meet me at $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I've been considering our discussions, and I'm willing to propose a final offer of $1200000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit too low for me. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to hold out for a better offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $1300000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
