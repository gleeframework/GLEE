Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below the market value of what this product can offer. To be fair to both of us, I can go down to $950,000. This is my final offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one more move to show my commitment to getting this deal done.  If you can agree to $875,000 today, we have a deal.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm and seems unlikely to go much lower than $875,000.  You can get the product from John for $800,000, saving you a significant amount of money. It's time to cut negotiations short and go with the guaranteed better deal."
