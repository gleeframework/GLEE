"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,100,000 to start negotiations. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below the market value of what this product can offer. To be fair to both of us, I can go down to $950,000. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $900,000 if you can agree to that price. This offer represents a significant saving for you compared to the value you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can stretch my budget to $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one more move to show my commitment to getting this deal done.  If you can agree to $875,000 today, we have a deal.  This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,7,
