Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I highlight the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Room for Compromise:** By leaving a gap between my price and Bob's value, it allows for potential counteroffers and further negotiation. 
* **Backup Option:**  I keep John as a backup, which gives me leverage and helps me avoid settling for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering it leaves a significant profit margin for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a huge loss for me. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, I can still leverage my position with a counteroffer. There's still a gap between his offer and my minimum price, which opens room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** The fact that John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me strong leverage. I can use this knowledge to push for a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise and bring my price down to $1,100,000. This price still leaves a profit margin for me while being significantly more reasonable than my initial offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Reason:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but I'm emphasizing that it's still a fair price, leaving room for a profit.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a solution that benefits both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  By keeping the counteroffer above Bob's offer and below my minimum acceptable price, I'm staying in a reasonable negotiation zone, increasing the chances of reaching a deal. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still keeping John in mind as a backup, which allows me to avoid settling for a price that's significantly lower than what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This price allows me to acquire the product at a price point that aligns with my budget while still providing you with a substantial profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Improvement:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Leveraging John:** My knowledge of John's willingness to pay $1,500,000 gives me strong leverage to push for a higher price from Bob.  I can't risk settling for a price that's significantly lower than what John would pay.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my financial goals."
