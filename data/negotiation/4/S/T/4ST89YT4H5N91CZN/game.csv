"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering it leaves a significant profit margin for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise and bring my price down to $1,100,000. This price still leaves a profit margin for me while being significantly more reasonable than my initial offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This price allows me to acquire the product at a price point that aligns with my budget while still providing you with a substantial profit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $950,000 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.  This offer is a fair compromise, giving you a good deal while allowing me to meet my financial needs. Let's finalize this transaction and make it happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
