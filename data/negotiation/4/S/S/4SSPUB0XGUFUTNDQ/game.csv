"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a strong offer, the true value of this product is far greater. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the unique nature and potential of what I'm offering.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Can we discuss further?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work.  How about we settle at $1,500,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,300,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
