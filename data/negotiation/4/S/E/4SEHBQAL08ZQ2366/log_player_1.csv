Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you're ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he counters lower, it's likely to be closer to your desired price than if you started at $80.
* **Confidence:** Offering a firm price with a message suggesting value shows confidence in your product.

It's important to remember that Bob doesn't know your minimum price or John's offer. This strategy is designed to maximize your potential profit while leaving you room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but  I'm only willing to pay $70 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is below your minimum acceptable price of $80. While his counteroffer indicates interest, accepting it would mean a loss. It's more strategic to counteroffer and see if you can negotiate a better deal. You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum price if negotiations with Bob don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:** By not drastically dropping your price, you're reinforcing the idea that the product has inherent value.
* **Leaving Room:**  While closer to your minimum, this counteroffer still leaves space for Bob to negotiate further if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about $85? I'm really close to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is above your minimum acceptable price of $80. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might lose interest or that you might not be able to reach a significantly better agreement. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
