"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's unlikely that Alice would be willing to sell for $800,000, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $880,000? This reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $880,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from her original asking price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without risking a further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a stalemate."
