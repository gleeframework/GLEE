"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower than Alice's Offer:**  Bob is offering $15 less than Alice's initial price, showing he's serious about getting a better deal.
* **Not Too Low:**  Offering $85 keeps the negotiation moving while still leaving some room for Alice to make a counteroffer.
* **Message:** The message expresses interest while also making it clear Bob isn't willing to accept the initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal for Bob:**  $95 is significantly lower than the $120 Bob would pay from John. It's also a good price for him, considering his maximum value is $120.
* **Limited Rounds:**  While further negotiation could potentially get a lower price, there are only 7 rounds remaining. The risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. 
* **Reasonable Counteroffer:**  Alice has already lowered her price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
