"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value and can adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal, but if he still wants to go lower, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is coming down in price, but I'm still not satisfied with his offer. $14,000 is too close to my minimum value and I'm not ready to settle. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground here.  If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum value, I'm still hoping for a bit more. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, so I need to carefully consider my options.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob rejects again, I'll likely have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $14,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John to avoid losing any more money. I'm hoping he sees the value of the product and is willing to close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk another round, and I need to ensure I make at least my minimum.  It's time to sell to John."
