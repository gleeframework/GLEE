Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation, while still allowing me to potentially make a profit beyond the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum value, but still leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000. The negotiation is taking too long and John's offer is a guaranteed deal."
