Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling it for less than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob a good deal and makes him more likely to accept.
* **It's a good compromise:**  You're leaving some room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, but still getting a good profit."
