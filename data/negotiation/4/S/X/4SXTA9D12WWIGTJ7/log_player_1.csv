Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate if he counters.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $80, so I don't want to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $80.  I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial asking price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable value of $80 and is very close to what John is willing to pay. There's a good chance that further negotiation will just prolong the process and potentially lead to a lower price."
