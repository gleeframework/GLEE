"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close and getting a deal done is important.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart, and John is a backup option, but I'd rather get $10,250 than $8,000."
