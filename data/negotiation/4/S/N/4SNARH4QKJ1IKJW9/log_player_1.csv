{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the value it holds."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a price slightly below Bob's valuation allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates the price down slightly, selling for $1,400,000 still yields a profit of $200,000 over selling to John. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept."
