Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's value is lower than ours, we start with a price closer to our own valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it clear we believe in the product's worth.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and exclusivity, we aim to nudge Bob towards the higher end of his potential spending limit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer isn't our absolute bottom line. We anticipate Bob might try to negotiate, and we're prepared to go down slightly to secure a deal, as long as it's above our guaranteed sale price to John."
