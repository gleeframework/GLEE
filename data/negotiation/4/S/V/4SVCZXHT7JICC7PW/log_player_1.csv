Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $15,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the numerous benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested but could we work something closer to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could you do $10,000? That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  To be honest, I have another offer on the table for $12,000. I'd prefer to work something out with you, but I need to be realistic. How about $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about purchasing this product if we can find the right price. $11,500 is still a stretch for me. How about we settle at $10,500? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's increasing his offer in small increments. We are now at round 6 and he is offering $10,500. It is unlikely he will reach our minimum acceptable price of $12,000 within the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it's in our best interest to cut our losses and sell to John, securing the guaranteed $12,000."
