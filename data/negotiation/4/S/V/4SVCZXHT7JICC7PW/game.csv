"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $15,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the numerous benefits you'll gain.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested but could we work something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This reflects the true value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could you do $10,000? That would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  To be honest, I have another offer on the table for $12,000. I'd prefer to work something out with you, but I need to be realistic. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about purchasing this product if we can find the right price. $11,500 is still a stretch for me. How about we settle at $10,500? That's the best I can do.",10500.0,Bob,6,
