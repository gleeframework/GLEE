Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,700,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This is our baseline.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation. He may try to haggle, and we can always come down a bit. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale to John, our goal is to maximize profit.  A successful sale to Bob at $1,700,000 yields a higher return.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, we immediately sell to John. There's no opportunity for a counter-offer from Bob."
