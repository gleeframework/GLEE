"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth $8,000 to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above your maximum valuation. You should reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your product is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to offer you $6,500 for it."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price but one that still allows room for negotiation. This approach aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much lower price.  If Alice completely rejects this offer, I can then decide if it's worth negotiating further or going with John's offer of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $7,250? It's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, but $7,250 is still a significant markup from her valuation. I'll reject and counteroffer again, pushing closer to my limit and seeing if there's room for a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000 even? That's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer, signaling to Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but not be pushed to my maximum. This offer is a good middle ground and might be acceptable to her while still saving me a considerable amount."
