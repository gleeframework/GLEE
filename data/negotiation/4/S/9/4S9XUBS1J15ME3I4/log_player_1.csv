Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer ($15,000) if Bob rejects your initial proposal.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some leverage and that Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product. It's crucial to assess your specific situation and adjust your approach accordingly."
