"Alice, thanks for the offer but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product but I can only offer $130 right now. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $130. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $140? I really want this product, and I think this is a fair compromise.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $152. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",152.0,Alice,5,
