"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in. I've priced it fairly at $925,000.  I believe this is a win-win scenario considering its potential worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's lower price and potentially negotiate an even better deal with Alice."
