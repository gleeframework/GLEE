{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below the value to you. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $790,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose an offer of $810,000. This allows us to meet somewhere in between our prices. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000

Bob's offer of $810,000 is close to my desired price and a good compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
