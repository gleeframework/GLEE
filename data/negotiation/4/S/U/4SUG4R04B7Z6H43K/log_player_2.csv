{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  A $1,100,000 offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for potential compromise. 
* **Balancing your goal with Alice's needs:** You're trying to get as close to your goal as possible, but still leaving space for Alice to potentially make a profit.

**Important Note:** This is a strategy, not a guarantee. Alice may reject this offer, and further negotiation will be needed."

* **Preparing for compromise:**  Alice may counter with a price closer to $1,300,000, leaving room for a final agreement.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer and your ideal price. 
* **Showing flexibility:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** It's still within your budget but risks pushing Alice to reject and further delay the negotiation.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target.** Although it's lower than her previous offer, it's still too high for you to comfortably accept.
* **Time is running out.** You're approaching the end of your negotiation rounds, and the risk of not reaching a deal is increasing.
* **John is a reliable backup option.** Buying from John guarantees you get the product, even if it's at a slightly higher price.

**Strategy:**  It's becoming increasingly likely that you won't be able to reach an agreement with Alice that meets your financial goals. Buying from John secures the product and avoids further negotiation rounds that might lead to a failed deal."
