Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $150 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the potential profit. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $80, so he's unlikely to immediately accept. However, the ""limited time"" and ""special price"" framing might make him reconsider.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
