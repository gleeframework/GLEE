"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a bit high for my budget though. Would you consider $65?"",
 ""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation tactic - start with a much lower offer than you're willing to pay. This gives us room to negotiate upwards and hopefully meet somewhere close to the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to what we want to pay, it's still above our budget. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're moving closer to a deal! This counteroffer shows Alice we're serious but also keeps us comfortably below our $80 maximum.  By stating we're ""ready to buy right now"", we're adding a bit of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $85. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting close, but we're still over our budget. We're getting into risky territory, but there's still a chance to negotiate a slightly better deal before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, $85 is very tempting, and I appreciate you coming down in price.  To be honest with you, $80 is the absolute most I can spend.  Is there any way you can meet me there?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is our last stand. We've been clear about our budget and indicated this is our final offer. This gives Alice the chance to make the deal or potentially lose the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $92. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to walk away. Alice is clearly not willing to budge below $90, and we've hit our absolute maximum budget.  John's offer of $80 is looking much better now!  We gave it a good try with Alice, but sometimes you have to know when to walk away from a negotiation."
