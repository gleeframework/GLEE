"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me and still allows you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $925,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $937,500? This is a fair price that considers both our needs and positions. I believe it's a reasonable compromise, and it would be a great step towards finalizing the deal. What do you think?",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $920,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the product, and I'm willing to make a final concession to get the deal done.",920000.0,Bob,6,
