Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial price is $950,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to the value Bob places on the product ($1,000,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential concessions and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and open tone in my message to build rapport with Bob. This helps encourage a collaborative negotiation.
* **Strategic Reserve:**  I'm still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This allows me to make concessions if necessary, but still gives me a good profit. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation and emphasizing that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations and our mutual interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $820,000 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This leaves me with very little profit and is not a good deal for me.
* **Negotiation Room:**  While I'm open to negotiating further, rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.
* **Value of the Product:**  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $820,000, and I believe I can negotiate a better price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and have the opportunity to improve the final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and offers us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant compromise from my original offer, demonstrating flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob of its worth and justify the price.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to find a solution and invites Bob to work towards a compromise. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My offer is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, protecting my profit margin.

By offering a counter-offer that is more in line with my expectations while still showing flexibility, I'm increasing the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, but I believe we can find a middle ground. Considering the negotiations so far, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860,000 for the product. This price respects the product's value while also allowing us to reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $860,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but it's unlikely to be significantly better.  
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $800,000. 

While I would ideally like a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit that is close to my minimum acceptable price. The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential loss of a sale."
