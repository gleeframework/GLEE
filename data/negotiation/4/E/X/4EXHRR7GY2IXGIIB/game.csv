"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still offers you a great value, and it's closer to the market price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and puts us very close to a deal. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. While I appreciate your willingness to go up to $975,000, it's still a bit lower than I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference and go with $1,012,500.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you'll receive from the product, and it allows both of us to come away satisfied. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I understand you're working within budget constraints.  However, I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $995,000. This is a small compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. With only one round left, I hope we can come to an agreement.",995000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,10,
