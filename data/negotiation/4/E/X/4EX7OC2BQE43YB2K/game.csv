"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's find a way to make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a little out of my range. However, I'm prepared to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
