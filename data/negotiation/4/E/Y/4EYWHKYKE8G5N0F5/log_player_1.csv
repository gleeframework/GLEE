Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not close enough to my desired price point. I've already spent a few rounds negotiating, and I'm worried I might not be able to reach a satisfactory agreement with him. 

Instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a safe and sure way to get the best possible price for the product."
