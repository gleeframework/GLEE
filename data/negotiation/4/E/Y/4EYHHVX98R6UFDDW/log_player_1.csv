{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $80 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm highlighting that the product is worth more than $80 to Bob, subtly emphasizing the potential for him to get a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.
* **Safety Net:**  I'm keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $150, so I'm not going to go too low too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I can only pay up to $80 for it. Would you consider accepting this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Bob acknowledges the product's value to me, suggesting he might be willing to pay more. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also highlights the value of the product.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the potential value he'd gain.
* **Keep the Door Open:** I'm using a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.
* **Maintain a Reasonable Margin:** $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150,  giving me a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $80 is still a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to my original offer of $80 if possible. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence of Low Offer:** Bob remains firm at $80, refusing to budge. This indicates a strong unwillingness to pay a fair price. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob is wasting valuable time. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $150, exceeding my minimum acceptable price and ensuring a positive outcome.
* **Limited Potential with Bob:**  Bob's insistence on $80 suggests that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. 

It's more efficient and profitable to accept John's offer and move on."
