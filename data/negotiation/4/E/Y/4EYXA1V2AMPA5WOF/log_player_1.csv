Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $149 seems slightly more ""affordable"" than a round $150, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or reject it entirely. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your potential profit."
