{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is slowly increasing his offer price.  We're still significantly above John's offer and have room to negotiate.  Rejecting at this stage maintains a slight pressure on Bob to keep moving closer to our desired price."

Round 7

Round 8

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we're close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and could potentially push Bob a little further, his offer is now at $950,000. This is a significant profit above John's offer of $800,000. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk Bob walking away in the final rounds."
