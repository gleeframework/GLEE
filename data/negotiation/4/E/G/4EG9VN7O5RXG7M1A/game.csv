"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do  $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and quality.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,800, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,200 for the product. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8200.0,Alice,5,
