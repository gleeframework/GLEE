"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has a lot of potential. However, I have a strict budget in mind for this purchase.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $900,000, I'm willing to counter with a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still gives you a good deal, but also acknowledges the product's true value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I'm prepared to walk away if I can't get this product for under $1,000,000. My final offer is $950,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your final offer of $950,000 is a tough one, but I'm still not willing to give up on this deal. Considering your willingness to walk away if you can't get the product for under $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
