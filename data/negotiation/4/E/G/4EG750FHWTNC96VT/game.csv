"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product that can generate a substantial return on investment. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
