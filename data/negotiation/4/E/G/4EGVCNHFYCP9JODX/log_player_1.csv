{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving a good profit margin for you.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This creates incentive for Bob to negotiate and potentially reach a price you're happy with.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response.  If he counter-offers, analyze his offer and decide if it's worth pursuing further, or if you should just sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to: 

* **Counteroffer:**  You can propose a price closer to your desired amount, potentially getting closer to a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, you show you're not desperate for a sale and that you value your product. 
* **Assess your options:**  If Bob's counteroffers are consistently low, you can confidently move to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's find a middle ground. How about $8,800? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **It's a compromise:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer but still maintain a profit.
* **It's reasonable:** $8,800 is a reasonable middle ground, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's encouraging:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of you.

This counteroffer shows Bob you're serious about selling to him but not willing to sacrifice your value.  It gives him another chance to negotiate while putting pressure on him to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I really like the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,400 is closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal. You have a few reasons to reject:

* **John's offer:**  You have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John, making Bob's offer less appealing. 
* **Potential to negotiate higher:** You've already demonstrated flexibility by lowering your price. Rejecting gives you a chance to counter again and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting, you show Bob you're not desperate and are willing to walk away if he doesn't meet you closer to your desired price.

It's a calculated risk, but you have a solid backup with John.  By rejecting and counteroffering again, you might be able to push Bob closer to your target price or, if he's firm, you can confidently move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,400 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $8,700. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal â€“ what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```

This counteroffer has several advantages:

* **Finality:** The message suggests this is your final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
* **Compromise:** You've lowered your price again, showing continued flexibility. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message highlights the benefits for both parties, emphasizing the ""fair compromise."" 

This counteroffer aims to secure a deal close to your minimum while making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.  If he still refuses, you can confidently move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still considering your proposal, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to lower the price to $8,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut your losses and move on to John. Here's why:

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  You've made several concessions, and Bob is consistently offering below your minimum. It's clear he's not willing to meet your desired price.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay your minimum price, providing a safe and profitable outcome. 
* **Time and Energy:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further delays and potentially a lower price in the end. 

Selling to John secures a better deal, saves you time and energy, and avoids potentially losing out on a profitable deal with John."
