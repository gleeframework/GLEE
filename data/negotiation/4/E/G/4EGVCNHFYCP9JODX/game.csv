"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's find a middle ground. How about $8,800? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I really like the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",8400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,400 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $8,700. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal â€“ what do you say?",8700.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still considering your proposal, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to lower the price to $8,600?",8600.0,Bob,6,
