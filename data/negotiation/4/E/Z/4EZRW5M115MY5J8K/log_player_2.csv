This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.

You can get the product from John for $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $900,000. While $900,000 is a better deal than $1,200,000, you are still able to get it for cheaper from John. You should reject Alice's offer."
