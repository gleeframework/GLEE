Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price - how about $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks again for the offer. $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, so how about we split the difference and I pay $112.50? Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $112.5 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price.  I'm hoping that by continuing the negotiation, I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $112.5 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - how about $118.75?  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 118.75}
