"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it.  How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on this. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the highest I can go at this point.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  However,  $700,000 is still a significant gap from what I consider fair. Let's settle at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
