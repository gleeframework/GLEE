# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're still quite far apart on this. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the highest I can go at this point."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  However,  $700,000 is still a significant gap from what I consider fair. Let's settle at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Alice has stated that $1,200,000 is her final offer. 
* **Your Limit:**  Your absolute limit is $800,000. 
* **John is reliable:** You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at your target price.

It's unlikely Alice will go below her stated limit.  Continuing the negotiation risks losing the opportunity to buy from John at your ideal price point."
