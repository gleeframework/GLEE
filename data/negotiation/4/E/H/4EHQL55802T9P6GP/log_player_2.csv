"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its worth while leaving room for discussion. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product. I could consider coming down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial. I'm willing to make a final offer of $890,000. This is my bottom line, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand at $890,000.  While continuing to negotiate with Alice *might* yield a slightly lower price, it's risky. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, guaranteeing you save money. It's strategically better to buy from John and secure your savings."
