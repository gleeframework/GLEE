"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to me is capped at $1500000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1500000 and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to walk away. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best compromise we can reach.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
