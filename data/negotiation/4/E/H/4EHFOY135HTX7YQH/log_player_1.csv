Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better offer from Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000?

Bob is getting very close to my minimum price, and I think this is a fair deal. Better to take a small profit now than risk him walking away and getting only $1,000,000 from John."
