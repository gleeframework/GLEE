"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $700,000? I think that's a fair price that considers its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I've reevaluated the product's value and I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $750,000? I'm very interested in the product and believe this would be a mutually beneficial deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
