{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm starting with an offer price of $20,000. Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make at least $5,000 more than your minimum.
* **It's not too high:** You want to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to counter-offer. 
* **It sets a positive tone:** You emphasize the value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to see it as a good deal. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer depending on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can lower the price slightly, but not too much. You want to leave room for bargaining while still maximizing your profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but that's my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum:**  You're not willing to sell for less than $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, you know he's interested in the product and might be willing to pay more.
* **John is a backup:** You have a guaranteed sale with John, so you're not in a rush to accept a low offer.

**Next Step:**

You will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to your desired value. You can start by offering a price slightly below your minimum, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This will demonstrate your willingness to negotiate while keeping the deal profitable for you."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $10,000. Let's split the difference. How about $17,500? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Value:** You're proposing a price that's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate, but still emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Leaves Room for Further Negotiation:**  $17,500 is still above your minimum, allowing for more negotiation if Bob counters again. 
* **Positive Tone:** Your message is friendly and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution.

By offering $17,500, you're keeping the door open for a potential deal while remaining firm on your minimum.  You're ready to adapt based on Bob's response, but also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $17500, which would be $13750. Can we discuss this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to your desired price, $13,750 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is a safe alternative:**  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum, and you have no reason to rush a deal with Bob. 
* **Negotiation room:**  You have more room to negotiate with Bob, as his offer is closer to your minimum. 

**Next Step:**

You'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to your minimum, aiming for a compromise.  You want to show you're still willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of your own financial goals."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low. Let's try $14,500. This is a good compromise that's fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value for this amazing product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closer to minimum:**  This offer is closer to your minimum of $15,000 than Bob's previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $12000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?

* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating there's little chance of him increasing his offer further.
