{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price ($200), leaving room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to establish a rapport with Bob.  Since I have a guaranteed sale for $150 with John, I can afford to be flexible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe $180 would be a fair price for me considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $180 is better than my minimum of $150, I think I can get closer to my initial asking price of $200.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $190? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 190} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $175 for the product. This price aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $190, $175 is still a good price and avoids any further negotiation.  I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with only the $150 offer from John."
