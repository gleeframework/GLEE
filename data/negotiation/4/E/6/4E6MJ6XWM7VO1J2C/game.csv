"Hello Bob, I believe this product could be of great value to your business. I'm initially offering it to you at a premium price of $1,300,000. Given its potential for growth, I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price is way beyond my budget.  I could consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To be fair to both of us, I can't go below $1,100,000. I'm confident that at this price, you'll see an excellent return on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. To be realistic, I can't go higher than $700,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the potential risks involved.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're not making much progress here, and I have other interested buyers.  To be frank, I have a standing offer for $1,000,000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a serious offer that reflects the true value of this product.  If we can't agree on a price close to that, I'll have to go with the other offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
