Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price is way beyond my budget.  I could consider a price closer to $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To be fair to both of us, I can't go below $1,100,000. I'm confident that at this price, you'll see an excellent return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. To be realistic, I can't go higher than $700,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the potential risks involved."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're not making much progress here, and I have other interested buyers.  To be frank, I have a standing offer for $1,000,000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a serious offer that reflects the true value of this product.  If we can't agree on a price close to that, I'll have to go with the other offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing strong resistance to lowering her price significantly.  She's revealed she has another offer at $1,000,000, which is likely close to her actual bottom line. Even if you continue negotiating, it's improbable you'll get her below $900,000, and you might end up empty-handed if she accepts the other offer. John's offer of $800,000 is your maximum and ensures you get the product."
