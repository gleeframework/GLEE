"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it could really benefit you.  Given its value, I'm initially offering it for $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired $15,000 limit. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,500 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant price reduction while still being reasonable.  It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to negotiate a better deal.  This approach can encourage further negotiations and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $14,500 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is within Bob's budget of $15,000. While it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $13,000, accepting this offer saves Bob $1,250 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise and allows Bob to secure the product without exceeding his budget."
