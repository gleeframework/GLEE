,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, which is a bit above your latest offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11000, considering the product's value to me?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I've already offered you a price of $11250 in the previous round, and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go below $11250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go up to $11500, but I don't think I can go any lower than that. Let's meet at $11500.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11200. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",11200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you a price of $11500 in the previous round, and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go below $11500. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the limit of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll meet you at $11750. If you're not willing to go above $11200, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11750.0,Alice,9,

"I understand your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $11200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11200 and $11750, which would be $11475. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options.",11475.0,Bob,10,
