Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your BATNA:** You have a strong alternative (BATNA) with John willing to pay $15,000. This gives you leverage.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but potentially within reach allows room for negotiation.
* **Justifying the price:**  Mentioning ""value and demand"" creates the perception that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the message implies you're open to discussion.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You might get a better outcome with a different approach depending on Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
