"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is significantly below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 might be a big jump.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close this deal!",15500.0,Alice,5,
