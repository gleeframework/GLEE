"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is significantly below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 might be a big jump.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still want to push for a slightly higher price.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you coming down.  Would you be willing to settle at $14,750?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure I want to risk getting a lower price by continuing.  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum.  It's time to move on."
