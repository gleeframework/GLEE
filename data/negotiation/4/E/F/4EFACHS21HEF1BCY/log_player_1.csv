Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob. Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A high initial offer gives Bob the impression the product is highly valued, but leaves space for him to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can make Bob more inclined to consider a higher price."
