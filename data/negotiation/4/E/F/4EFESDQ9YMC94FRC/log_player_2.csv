"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm thinking $175 would be a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $175 is well above your maximum budget of $100.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Alice is open to negotiation, so there's an opportunity to get a better price.
* **John is a backup option:** You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $100, giving you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:**  Offer your maximum price of $100 to see if Alice is willing to budge significantly. 
* **Justify the price:**  Mention the product's value to you, showing you've considered its worth. 
* **Be polite:** Keep the tone friendly to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130?  It's a fair compromise that still lets me make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $130 is still over your $100 limit.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and  there's still a gap between her offer and your budget. 
* **John is a secure backup:** You have a guaranteed alternative with John, so you can afford to be patient and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $130 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. This allows for a decent profit for you, and it's a price I can comfortably afford. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Offer a compromise:** Propose a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest one.
* **Emphasize the benefits:**  Highlight that this price is beneficial for both of you.
* **Be persistent:**  Show that you are still interested in the product but want a price that works for you."
