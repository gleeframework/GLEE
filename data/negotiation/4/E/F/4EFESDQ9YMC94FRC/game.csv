"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130?  It's a fair compromise that still lets me make a reasonable profit.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $130 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. This allows for a decent profit for you, and it's a price I can comfortably afford. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
