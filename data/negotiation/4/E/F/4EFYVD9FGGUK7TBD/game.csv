"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $900,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can feel it!  How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm still making a significant profit. What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
