"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I would like to counter with a price of $105 for the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $100. I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
