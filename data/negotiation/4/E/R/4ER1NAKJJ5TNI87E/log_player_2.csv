"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $13,000.  Since Alice values the product at $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $11,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  Alice is offering $12,800, which is significantly less than the $15,000 John is asking.
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:** While Bob can make another counteroffer, it's possible Alice will not budge further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice withdrawing her offer or Bob losing the product to another buyer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $12,800 is the most prudent decision, as it secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the product."
