Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my own valuation ($1,200,000), but I'm also aware of Bob's valuation and the risk of losing him.
* The initial offer leaves room for negotiation without being too aggressive. 
* I have a safety net with John, so I'm not pressured to sell to Bob at a low price.

I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push for a better deal.  Here's why:

* **My valuation:** The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I'm confident I can find another buyer willing to pay that.
* **Negotiation room:** Bob's offer is still $50,000 below my ideal price. There's still room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,100,000, aiming to meet him halfway while still maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've countered with $1,075,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a better price.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's concerns and make it clear that I'm willing to be flexible, but not at the cost of significantly lowering my profit margin. I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to encourage a positive response. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good price and avoiding a stalemate.
* I'm using a firm but friendly tone to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* I'm keeping in mind that I can always fall back on selling to John if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've reviewed the situation again and decided to lower my counteroffer to $1,060,000. This price still respects my budget constraints while offering a fair deal for both parties. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is only $40,000 below my ideal price of $1,100,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to accept his offer and close the deal rather than risk further negotiation. Here's why:

* **Limited room for negotiation:**  There's not much more wiggle room in the price. Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate and a possible loss of the deal altogether.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation would require more time and effort, which I might be able to spend elsewhere, potentially earning more.
* **Potential for delay:**  Negotiating further might delay the sale, potentially impacting future plans or opportunities. 

**Overall, accepting Bob's offer provides a good return and minimizes risk.** I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future if I need to, but for now, this is a satisfactory outcome."
