Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  While $1,025,000 is a step in the right direction, it still falls short of my minimum expectation.

Let's close this deal.
