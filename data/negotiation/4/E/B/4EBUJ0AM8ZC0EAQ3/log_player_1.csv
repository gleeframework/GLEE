Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is appreciated, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $1,025,000. This price is fair, allows you a decent profit, and keeps me within my budget.  Let's work together to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

While $1,025,000 is getting closer to my desired range, it's still not enough.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  While $1,025,000 is a step in the right direction, it still falls short of my minimum expectation.
