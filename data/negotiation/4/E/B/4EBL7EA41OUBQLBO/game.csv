"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which reflects the value of the product to me while staying within my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good opportunity for us both to make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
