# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and hopefully get a better price."
