Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:** This will hopefully encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, leading to a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, you can potentially get more.  Bob is clearly interested, so there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer that's still appealing to him while being more advantageous for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is tempting, I need a bit more to make this work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still represent a great value for you, and would allow me to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point,  $9,750 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will result in a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of potentially lower offers in future rounds."
