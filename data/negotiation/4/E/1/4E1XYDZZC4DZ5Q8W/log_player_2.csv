"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm asking for $11,500 for, but I'm sure you'd agree it's worth more than that. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss it further. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to move on to John, who is willing to sell at a price that fits Bob's budget."
