"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially capture more of the surplus value.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the potential benefit for Bob by highlighting the value he gets for the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have rounds left to negotiate with Bob. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still represents a good value for you, as it's below the product's worth to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob still gets at the proposed price, making it more appealing.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not going below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm demonstrating flexibility to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to my budget, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **More negotiation rounds:** I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. There's still a chance I can get a better price.
* **Guaranteed sale to John:** I have a backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,000, which still reflects the value of the product to you. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else.  What's your decision?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm communicating that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Compromise:** I'm further reducing my offer to show I'm still trying to reach an agreement. 
* **Reminding of value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making the offer more attractive.
* **Pressure to decide:** By mentioning selling to someone else, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
