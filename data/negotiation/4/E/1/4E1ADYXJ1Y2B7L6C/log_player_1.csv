Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and the product's worth to me. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit high on that price. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $10,500 is my absolute lowest I can go.  This still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $10,250 is a good price, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer.  It's also a good compromise that allows for a smooth negotiation."
