"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($80) but not so high that it would immediately turn Bob off. I'm hoping this encourages him to negotiate, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not unhappy with $80, I think I can do better. Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'd like to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is higher than what John is offering, and is within a reasonable range of my desired price.  I'll accept this offer and move on."
