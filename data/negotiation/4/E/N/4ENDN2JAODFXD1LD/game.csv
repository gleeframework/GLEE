,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10250? I believe this price is fair for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I do too.  $10250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9875? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both.",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9875 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet halfway again and settle on $10062? I believe this price is fair, and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment.",10062.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10062 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to split the difference again and meet at $9968.  Let's close this deal and both get what we want.",9968.0,Bob,6,
