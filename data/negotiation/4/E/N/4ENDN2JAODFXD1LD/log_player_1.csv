"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $9,500 is still below my minimum of $8,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I do too.  $10250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9875? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,875 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get even closer to $10,000. I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,875 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet halfway again and settle on $10,062? I believe this price is fair, and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 10062}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10062 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to split the difference again and meet at $9968.  Let's close this deal and both get what we want. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,968. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,968
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,968 is very close to my desired price of $10,000, and it's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. It's time to close the deal."
