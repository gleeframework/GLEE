{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not aiming for a quick sale, so leaving room for negotiation allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially secure a better price.
* **Having a backup:** I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my minimum value, knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation room:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. This means there's potential to reach a more favorable price in subsequent rounds. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my minimum value while still being reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own value.
* **Reasonable compromise:** $9,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still keeps me above my minimum value. It also positions me to potentially close the deal while maintaining a good margin.
* **Maintaining communication:**  My message reiterates the value of the product and emphasizes a spirit of compromise, keeping the negotiation open and positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting would mean losing money on the sale. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  I believe there's still room to push for a price closer to my minimum.
* **John is a safety net:**  As before, knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured.

**Next steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price slightly higher than his current offer. This will show I'm open to reaching a compromise but also highlight that $8,750 is still unacceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. While I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,250. This would give us both a good deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:** I highlight the value of the product and emphasize the fairness of the price for both parties.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategic consideration:** This counteroffer keeps me above my minimum value while demonstrating flexibility. It also puts pressure on Bob to either accept or come up with a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $8,900 is still too far below my minimum value of $10,000.  While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, I'm not convinced we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time is money:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk further delays.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum value and avoids any potential for further losses.

**Conclusion:**  While I'm slightly disappointed to not close the deal with Bob, it's important to prioritize my own financial well-being. John offers a reliable sale that meets my minimum requirements, so I'm choosing to sell to him."
