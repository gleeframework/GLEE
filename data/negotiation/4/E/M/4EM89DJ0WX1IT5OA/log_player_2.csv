"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, which I believe to be at least $1,500,000. You'll be able to acquire a valuable asset for a price that offers a substantial return on investment.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for as little as possible. Even though Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's budget of $800,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000, saving $500,000."
