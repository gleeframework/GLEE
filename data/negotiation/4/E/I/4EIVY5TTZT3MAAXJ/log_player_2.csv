"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product for a price of $11,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you're trying to save as much as possible,  $11,000 is still a better price than $12,000. 
* **The goal is to buy the product.**  You don't want to miss out on the product altogether just to save a little more."
