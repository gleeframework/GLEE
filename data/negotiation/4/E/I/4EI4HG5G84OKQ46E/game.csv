,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for this product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $90, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",95.0,Alice,5,
