"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go to $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident that this price is fair, considering the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
