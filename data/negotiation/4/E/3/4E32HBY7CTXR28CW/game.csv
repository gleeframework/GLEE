"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
