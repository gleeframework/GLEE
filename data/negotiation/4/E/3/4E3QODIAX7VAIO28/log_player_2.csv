Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Given the value you place on the product and your willingness to pay $130, I propose a price of $135 for it. This still allows us to reach a fair agreement while considering the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is now within my budget of $150. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's a reasonable offer considering the product's worth to Alice. Accepting this offer allows me to get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation rounds and potentially being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
