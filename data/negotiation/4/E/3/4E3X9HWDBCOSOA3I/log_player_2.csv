"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject the offer. While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer."
