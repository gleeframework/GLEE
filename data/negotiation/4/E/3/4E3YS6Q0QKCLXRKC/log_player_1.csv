Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price, as I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to hold out for a better deal. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $9,500. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still closer to my desired price.  I believe it's a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would have liked to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is a good compromise. Selling to John would be a safer option, but I'm willing to take a slight loss to close the deal."
