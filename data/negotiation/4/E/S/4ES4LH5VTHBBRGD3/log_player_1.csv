This allows for a reasonable negotiation point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet at $1100000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price.

Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1100000, which would be $1125000. Can we agree on that price?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,125,000 is a good compromise and a fair price.  It's important to remember that John is a fallback option, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely."
