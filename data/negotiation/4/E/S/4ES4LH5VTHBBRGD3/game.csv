"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable asset that holds significant potential. I believe its worth is no less than $1000000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  My initial offer is $1500000.  Let's discuss this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can we meet in the middle?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position,  $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure a fair return. How about we split the difference at $1250000? This allows for a reasonable negotiation point for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet at $1100000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is still below what I consider a fair price for this product. To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and a good midpoint for us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1100000, which would be $1125000. Can we agree on that price?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
