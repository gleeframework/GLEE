**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's advantageous to reject and make a counteroffer to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is lower than her previous offer but still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  However, it's getting closer to Bob's target price and it's not worth risking further negotiation, as there's a chance Alice might reject again and the price might go up. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is still within Bob's budget."
