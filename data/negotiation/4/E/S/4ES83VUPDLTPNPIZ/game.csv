"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, considering your interest in the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,200. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down further, Alice. However, $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,6,
