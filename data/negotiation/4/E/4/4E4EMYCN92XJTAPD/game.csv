"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. I know I can get it for that price elsewhere, but I'd prefer to deal with you if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
