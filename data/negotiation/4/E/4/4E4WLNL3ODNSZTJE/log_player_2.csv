Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,200 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  Considering the value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $9,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied.
