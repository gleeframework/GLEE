Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and considering its value to you, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know the product's value to both Bob and John, I want to start with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob aims to make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  Hinting at other buyers might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product. If he rejects the offer, I have the security of John's offer at my minimum acceptable price."
