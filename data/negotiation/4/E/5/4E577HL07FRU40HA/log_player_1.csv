Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's higher than your minimum price ($80) but lower than Bob's estimated value ($120). This gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to, but it's still a good deal for you. 
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** By not immediately asking for the full $120, you're demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer, or you can always choose to sell to John for $80 if you feel you're not getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
