Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I believe it's a strong starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $900,000 is a good price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially considering Bob's initial rejection of my offer. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I believe this offer is attractive to Bob, while also allowing for potential further negotiation if needed."
