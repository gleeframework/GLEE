Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (Your value from selling to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (If he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that $200,000 potential profit for yourself as possible.  Offering the product for anything less than $1,000,000 is leaving money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by emphasizing the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 profit, a strong incentive for him to accept.  
* **No Justification:** You don't need to justify the price immediately. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob pushes back.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. Bob may counter-offer.  Be prepared to negotiate, but always keep your bottom line ($1,000,000) in mind."
