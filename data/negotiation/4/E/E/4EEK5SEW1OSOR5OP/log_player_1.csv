Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy**

The key here is understanding your backup offer. Since John will buy the product for $1,500,000 (your minimum acceptable price), you have leverage with Bob.  You should aim for a price that's appealing to Bob but also nets you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's made available elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's potential gain. The mention of making it ""available elsewhere"" subtly hints at your other options without revealing your guaranteed sale.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. 
    * It's significantly less than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
    * It's $150,000 more than Bob's perceived value, potentially leaving room for negotiation while ensuring you make a substantial profit.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down to $1,200,000 if needed, still making a profit.
* **Confidence:**  Project confidence in your offer. You know the product's worth, and you have a strong alternative if Bob declines."
