"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $9,000. I think this is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the offer is within Bob's budget, he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $8,800 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John for $8,000 is not worth it.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $800 compared to buying from John."
