"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher figure. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $925,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
