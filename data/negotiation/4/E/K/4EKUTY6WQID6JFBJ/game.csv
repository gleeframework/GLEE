"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to secure the product without exceeding my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
