"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and much higher than my minimum price. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $810,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
