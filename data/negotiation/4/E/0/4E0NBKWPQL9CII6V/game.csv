"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
