"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I believe the product is valuable, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
