I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to earn more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. It's also closer to my desired price. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
