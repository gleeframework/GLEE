"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,500 is above Bob's ideal price point of $12,000.
* **John's offer:** Provides a safety net at $12,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer to try and negotiate a better price. He can use John's offer as leverage in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point of $12,000.
* **John's offer:** Provides a safety net at $12,000.

Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price. He has leverage because John's offer provides a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's meet halfway, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,875? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,875 is getting close to Bob's ideal price point of $12,000 and within his budget. 
* **John's offer:** While it's still an option, Bob is now closer to getting a better deal with Alice.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already saved $1,125 compared to John's offer, and further negotiation may not yield a significant enough price reduction to justify the risk of losing the deal."
