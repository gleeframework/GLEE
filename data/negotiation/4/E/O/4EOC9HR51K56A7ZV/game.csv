"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob. $11,000 is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $13,500? It's a compromise that works for me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
