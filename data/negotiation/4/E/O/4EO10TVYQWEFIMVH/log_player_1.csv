Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $95. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $100 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so the offer needs to be enticing enough to bridge that gap.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides a strong fallback position.

Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a potential ""gain"" of $15 ($95 value - $80 cost) while securing you a profit close to your maximum."
