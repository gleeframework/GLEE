"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000.  This is a bold move, but it gives me the best chance of securing a high price quickly. If Bob rejects, I can always lower my price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a more reasonable price point, especially considering Bob rejected my initial offer.  I believe it's a fair compromise and will hopefully encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already rejected a lower offer from him, and I don't want to risk losing him completely. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $15,000. It's not the ideal price, but it ensures a sale and avoids any further negotiation."
