"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the thought, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're trying to stay within a budget, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not able to meet you at $120, I would like to propose $95 as my maximum offer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hesitant to accept Bob's offer of $95, as it's below my minimum price of $150. However, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm flexible. Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground, Alice. Considering your flexibility, I'd like to counter with $105. I believe this offers a fair compromise while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  It's risky to continue negotiating as I could end up with less.  Selling to John is still an option, but I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob."
