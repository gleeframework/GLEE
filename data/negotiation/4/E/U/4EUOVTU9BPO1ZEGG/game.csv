"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of this product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know if this price works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while being more in line with your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you be open to considering that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900,000. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value while being more in line with your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
