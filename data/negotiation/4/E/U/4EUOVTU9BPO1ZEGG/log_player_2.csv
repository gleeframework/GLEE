"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you be open to considering that?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900,000. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value while being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than $1,050,000 in the remaining rounds.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the product at the best possible price now rather than risk Alice not budging enough."
