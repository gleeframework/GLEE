"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a great price for a product worth much more, and it would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows him I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring a good deal for myself.  Let's see if he's more receptive this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Could we perhaps aim for $90? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's a good deal for both of us, so I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $90."
