"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said,  $950,000 is a significant step from my initial offer considering the value this product brings.  Could we agree on a price of $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
