"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,5,
