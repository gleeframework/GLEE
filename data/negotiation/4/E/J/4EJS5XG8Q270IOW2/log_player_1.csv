I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 from John, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **High offer:** By starting high, I create a sense of value and leave space for negotiation.  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay a premium.
* **Guaranteed backup:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so I'm not taking a huge risk.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
