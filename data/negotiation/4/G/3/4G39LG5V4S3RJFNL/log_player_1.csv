Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** We start high to maximize potential profit, aiming closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Justification:**  Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning ""its potential worth to you"" subtly highlight the value to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially still landing within a range very profitable for Alice.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price."
