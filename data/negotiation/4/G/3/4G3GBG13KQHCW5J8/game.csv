,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd only be willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm firm on $120. This is what I'm comfortable paying, and I'm happy to walk away if we can't reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $145. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I hope you can meet me in the middle.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $145 is a step closer, I'm still only able to offer $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $130, which is $137.50. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",137.5,Alice,7,
