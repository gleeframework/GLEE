"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm going to start high, aiming for a good profit.  This price is 20% higher than the product's value to Bob. It's likely he'll counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me and closer to Bob's value, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer again and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $980,000 is getting close, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm going to counteroffer one last time to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering $1,020,000, which is a significant compromise, but still a good deal for me.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If not, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob, and I'm running out of rounds.  While $990,000 is a good price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's less than my ideal price, but it's still a good deal, and I'm not willing to risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
