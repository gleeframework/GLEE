"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer, giving you some room to bargain. You can adjust the price based on how confident you are in negotiating with Alice and how likely you think she is to accept a price lower than $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to me, but it's getting closer. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice that you're willing to pay more than your initial offer but still less than her last offer. This approach allows you to keep negotiating while maintaining a positive dialogue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to me.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. Buying from John at $8,000 ensures I get the product at my maximum price limit."
