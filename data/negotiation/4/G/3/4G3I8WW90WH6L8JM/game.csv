"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $775000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $790000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",790000.0,Alice,5,
