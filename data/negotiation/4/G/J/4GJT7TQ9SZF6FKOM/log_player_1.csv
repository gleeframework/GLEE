"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm going to start high, aiming for a good profit.  This price is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see where we can negotiate."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering a price lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal. While John is a safe option, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, but still maintains my minimum value for the product. I believe that at this price, Bob will see the value and be willing to close the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are taking a long time, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum value. It's getting close to the end of our rounds, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum value, and it's time to secure the deal."
