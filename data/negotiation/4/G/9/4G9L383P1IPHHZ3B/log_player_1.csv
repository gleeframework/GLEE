{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your guaranteed minimum:**  $1,150,000 is more than the $1,000,000 you'd get from John, so it's already a win for you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more than $1,150,000 to secure the deal. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** A $50,000 increase from your minimum price is significant but not overly aggressive, making it more likely for Bob to consider the offer. 

By offering this price, you maximize your potential earnings while still remaining competitive."
