{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if he counteroffers, but also ensures I make a profit. I'm also using a friendly tone to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell for $100, but I'm also not ready to give up on this negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115.  This still gives me a good price and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $115. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to pay that price for the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still below my initial asking price, it's closer to my minimum price of $120.  It's also in the middle ground between our offers.  This seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather sell to Bob for $110 than risk a further negotiation or sell to John for only $120."
