"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110.  I believe it's worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $110, while John is selling for $120.
* **The offer is within your budget:**  The $110 offer is less than your $120 maximum.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money while still acquiring the product."
