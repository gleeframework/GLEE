"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the description of the product. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $9500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can agree on it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $9500 to make it worth my while. How about $10000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
