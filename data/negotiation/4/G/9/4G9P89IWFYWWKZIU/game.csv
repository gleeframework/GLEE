"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  I'm still not quite there at $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? That way we can both save a bit.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $102? It's still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $99.  I think that's a good middle ground that allows us both to save a bit.",99.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, Bob. However, I still think I can get a bit more. How about we try $104? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",104.0,Alice,7,
