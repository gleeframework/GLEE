I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,500,000 from John, but it gives Bob room to negotiate if he's interested. 

I'm hoping that Bob values the product higher than $1,500,000, and that he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John and guarantee my minimum profit."
