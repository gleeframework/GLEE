Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message indicates that I'm open to discussing the price further, which could lead to a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Next steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response, whether it's an acceptance, a counteroffer, or a rejection. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and my willingness to negotiate further based on how close it is to my minimum acceptable price.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll either counter with a higher price or simply sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.  
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to Bob guarantees me a sale, while selling to John introduces the risk that John might back out later.

**By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a potential profit.**"
