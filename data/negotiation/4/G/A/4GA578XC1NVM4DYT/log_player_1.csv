"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $80. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a friendly tone, signaling that I'm open to discussing the price further. 
* **Avoiding John:** I want to try and close the deal with Bob first to potentially get a higher price than John's $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential:** There are 8 rounds remaining, providing opportunity for a better offer.  
* **John's offer:**  While $120 is a good backup, I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? This gives you a great deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($90) and my previous offer ($100). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm again highlighting the value Bob receives at this price, making it seem like a good deal for him. 
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving.
* **John's Offer:** While $120 is still in the back of my mind, I want to see if I can get closer to that number with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $92 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $120.
* **Small Increase:** Bob's offer is only a $2 increase from his previous one, which isn't enough to justify accepting it.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There are 6 rounds left, giving me more time to try and get a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** Although $120 is attractive, I want to explore the potential of a better deal with Bob before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway with your last offer.  I'm still a bit too far from my target price, though. How about we go with $94?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing the price by $2, showing a willingness to compromise but not giving in too quickly.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the $94 price as ""fair"" for both parties, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  I'm suggesting finalizing the deal to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **John's Offer:**  While $120 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to that with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your reasoning, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $93 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My minimum acceptable price is $120, and $93 is still significantly below that. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have 4 rounds remaining to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  Although $120 is a guaranteed profit, I want to exhaust all options with Bob first.
* **Small Increase:** Bob's offer is only $1 higher than his previous offer, indicating he may be reaching his limit. This makes it even more important to see if I can get a higher offer in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again â€“ $93.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  It's getting late in the negotiations, so let's make a final decision. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($94) and Bob's last offer ($93). This shows a willingness to be flexible and encourages Bob to meet halfway.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the time constraint by saying ""it's getting late in the negotiations,"" subtly pressuring Bob to make a decision. 
* **Finality:** I'm framing this offer as a final one, hoping to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further haggling.
* **John's Offer:** While $120 is still tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob before resorting to John."
