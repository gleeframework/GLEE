"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I am very interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me at the moment. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your feedback, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a bit of a bigger discount. Would you be willing to settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a bigger discount, Bob, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I make a fair profit. How about we meet at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's also the price John is willing to pay if we don't reach an agreement?",800000.0,Alice,5,
