Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your feedback, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $825,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a bigger discount, Bob, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I make a fair profit. How about we meet at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's also the price John is willing to pay if we don't reach an agreement? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is now at her lowest price, matching John's offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John at this point as we won't get a better deal."
