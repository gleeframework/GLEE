"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $750000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $750000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. This reflects its potential value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1200000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This price is fair considering its potential value, and it allows us both to walk away happy. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1075000. This is still a discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
