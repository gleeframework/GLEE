"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $13,000, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
