"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his limit of $10,000. He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his limit of $10,000.  He should continue negotiating and try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $13,000, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $15,000, which is $14,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's limit, and with only 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely they'll reach a mutually agreeable price. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
