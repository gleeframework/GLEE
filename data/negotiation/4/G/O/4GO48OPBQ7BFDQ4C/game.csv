"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12250? This price still gives you a good value, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $11800? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",11800.0,Bob,4,
