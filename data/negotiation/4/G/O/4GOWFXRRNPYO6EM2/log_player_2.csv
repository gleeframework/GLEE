Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made several concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're serious about the product, this is my final offer.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  He has made multiple counteroffers, and Alice is unwilling to go lower than $12,000.  While he could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice will not budge, and he's already in the final round. It's in his best interest to purchase the product from John and save himself the hassle and expense of continuing negotiations."
