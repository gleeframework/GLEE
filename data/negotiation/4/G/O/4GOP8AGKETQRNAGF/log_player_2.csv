"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Your value:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's value:** The product is worth $120 to Alice.
* **Alice's offer:** $140.

It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can still get the product for $150 from John, which is your maximum value. This means you're paying your maximum, but not overpaying."
