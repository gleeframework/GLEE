"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $90 is above Bob's maximum price of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $82 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his ideal price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get it closer to his $80 target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice.  I appreciate it.  I'm still a little too high. How about $78? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 78} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I can do $80.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $80.50 is very close to Bob's target price of $80, Bob is still in a position to try to get a better deal. There are only a few rounds left and it's worth trying to see if Alice will go lower.  If not, Bob can always buy from John for $80."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $80.50.  I'm really close to my budget, and  I'm wondering if we can settle on $80?  It's fair for both of us and we can close this deal right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
