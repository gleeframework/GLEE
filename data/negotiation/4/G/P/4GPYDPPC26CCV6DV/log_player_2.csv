"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm definitely interested, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to your own valuation of the product.  Would you consider $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's also closer to her valuation of the product, making it more likely she'll consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the product's value to you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above her own valuation of the product. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a new counteroffer is the best option. Bob can try to push for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also willing to meet Alice halfway. It's a reasonable price that could potentially lead to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's concession:** Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer of $900,000, showing she's motivated to reach a deal.
* **Close to Bob's target:** The price of $975,000 is just $75,000 above Bob's desired price, making it a good deal considering the value of the product to him.
* **Risk of going to John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, he risks having to buy from John for a significantly higher price ($1,200,000). 

It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's still well within his budget."
