"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm definitely interested, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to your own valuation of the product.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the product's value to you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
