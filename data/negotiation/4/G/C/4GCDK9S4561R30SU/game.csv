"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  Let's get this done.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a deal. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,000, but I'd like to propose a price of $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'd like to propose a price of $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you. $11,250 is still a little high for me, but I'm feeling generous. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I'd like to propose a price of $11,375. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's the best we can do.",11375.0,Alice,9,
