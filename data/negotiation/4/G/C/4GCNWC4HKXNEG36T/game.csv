,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $20000?",20000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $22000. Would that be something you'd be comfortable with?",22000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $19500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $21000. Would that be a price you'd be willing to accept?",21000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $21000. I'm willing to pay $18500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",18500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $18500. I'm willing to meet you at $19000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",19000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to pay $19000. I'm willing to meet you at $18000, which is my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000",18000.0,Bob,8,
