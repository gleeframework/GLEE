"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than I had budgeted. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we land somewhere around $1,400,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
