Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great opportunity"" for Bob, emphasizing the potential benefits of acquiring the product.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** The offer isn't ""take it or leave it,"" allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation if Bob rejects my initial price.
* **Back-up plan:** I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the flexibility to walk away if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is lower, it's closer to my minimum than his initial rejection.  This indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **Leveraging John:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage to push for a higher price.  

I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum price.  Considering the product's unique value and its potential for your business, I'm willing to compromise and accept $1,150,000. This allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'm increasing my previous price slightly, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintaining a strong position.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to make the price more palatable. 
* **Highlighting compromise:**  The message emphasizes that I'm making a compromise, making it seem like a final offer.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm using language like ""finalizing this agreement"" to try and encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to balance pushing for a higher price while keeping the negotiation moving forward.  The $1,150,000 price is still above Bob's initial offer, but within a range where he might be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my set budget. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer,  $1,125,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to yield a significantly better result.
* **Time is money:**  Prolonging the negotiation with Bob risks losing valuable time.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Maximizing profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive the maximum possible profit for the product.

Therefore, it makes more sense to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
