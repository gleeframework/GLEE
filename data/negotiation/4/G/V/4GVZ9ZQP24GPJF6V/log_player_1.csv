I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm hoping to get as close to my target price as possible. 

It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through.  I'll be monitoring Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my original offer, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $12,000 and my initial offer of $15,000. I believe this shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's more profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is a good compromise and significantly better than John's offer.  It's important to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a failed negotiation altogether."
