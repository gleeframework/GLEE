(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
