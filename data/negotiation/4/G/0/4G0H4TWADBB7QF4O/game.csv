"Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for a quick sale.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and our time. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to move forward quickly.",900000.0,Bob,4,
