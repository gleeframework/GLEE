"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other potential buyers. I'm confident in its value, so I'm setting the price at $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is below her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the guaranteed price from John. You stand to save a considerable amount ($250,000) by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
