"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe the price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob's budget of $800,000.
* It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. 
* Buying from John immediately would be the safest option, but it limits the potential for a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal limit. 
* It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will go lower. 
* Buying from John right now is an option, but there's a chance of getting a better price from Alice with a counteroffer."
