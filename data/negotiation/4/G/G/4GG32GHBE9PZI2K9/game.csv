"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. Can you consider it?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $14000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $16000?  This is a fair price for a product of this quality.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider it?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. But $13500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",15000.0,Alice,5,
