"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable about the price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,600,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $1,550,000? I think that's a fair price for the product and allows for a good profit margin for you as well.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
