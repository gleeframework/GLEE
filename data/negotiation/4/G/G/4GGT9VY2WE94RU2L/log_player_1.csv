"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable about the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price and I believe I can get closer to my target price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,600,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $1,550,000? I think that's a fair price for the product and allows for a good profit margin for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,550,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to remember that John is a guaranteed sale, but a little more negotiation with Bob could get me closer to my initial asking price."
