"Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth and still allows you a considerable return on investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so my counteroffer is $900,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
