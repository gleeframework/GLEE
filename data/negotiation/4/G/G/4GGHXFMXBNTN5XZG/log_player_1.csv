Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. 
* This price is significantly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* It also sets the tone that I'm confident in the value of my product. 
* My goal is to see how far Bob is willing to go, and gauge whether further negotiation is worth my time before potentially selling to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.
* Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* This counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* However, it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* By dropping the price, I'm showing willingness to negotiate, but I'm not giving away too much.
* This gives Bob room to increase his offer while still staying within his perceived value of the product."

**Explanation:**

* Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems Bob is unlikely to meet my price.

* This decision ensures I get the best possible outcome for myself, even if it means missing out on potentially negotiating a higher price with Bob."
