Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has signaled that $975,000 is his final offer. It's unlikely he will significantly increase his bid in future rounds.  Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000 which is a better outcome than potentially accepting a lower offer from Bob or dragging out the negotiation further."
