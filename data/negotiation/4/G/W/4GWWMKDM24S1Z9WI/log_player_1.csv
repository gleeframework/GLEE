I will reject Bob's offer, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, as selling to John for $150 is my fallback option if I can't get a better price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's only $10 below my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale to John, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher price."
