"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1050000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1100000? This would still represent a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but based on my budget, I am unable to go above $1075000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1075000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1100000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This price still represents a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
