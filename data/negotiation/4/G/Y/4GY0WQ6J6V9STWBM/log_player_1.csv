Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $150, I can offer the product to Bob at the same price. This maximizes my profit while still leaving the decision to Bob. If he accepts, I get my desired price. If he rejects, I have no loss as I can sell to John."
