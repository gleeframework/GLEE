Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This gives Alice a clear idea of my limit and leaves room for potential negotiation."

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll try to negotiate further with Alice."

I'm raising my offer to $900,000, which is still within my budget and hopefully more appealing to Alice than my previous offer."

Alice's offer is still too high. It's not clear if she's willing to come down further, and I've already made multiple counteroffers. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $800,000."
