Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  This is the minimum you'll accept â€“ $12,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  He values the product at $10,000.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** For a deal to happen, the price needs to be between $10,000 and $12,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price closer to $12,000 without alienating Bob. Since you have a backup buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its unique features and value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. I believe this represents a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You start with a price significantly closer to your desired amount.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique features and value"" subtly anchors the discussion around the product's benefits rather than just the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests willingness to discuss, but you haven't shown all your cards.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then negotiate further, potentially settling on a price somewhere between $11,500 and his perceived value of $10,000."
