``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the likelihood that Bob will counter-offer, giving me the opportunity to potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price by making a counter-offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I look forward to your consideration.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price with another counter-offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I understand the value of the product and your position. Based on our negotiation thus far, I would like to propose a final offer of $11000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests and financial constraints. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm confident that John will purchase the product for $15,000. This is a significantly better outcome for me, and I'm willing to accept the certainty of that sale."
