,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $1,200,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $1,300,000. This product is worth a lot more than $1,250,000, and it would be a loss for me at that price. I'm willing to compromise and stay firm at $1,300,000. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not comfortable going lower, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'll offer $1,220,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
