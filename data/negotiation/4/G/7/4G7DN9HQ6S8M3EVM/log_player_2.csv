{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $95 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $85?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $85 is still a bit high. Let's continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about $75? That seems like a fair compromise."",

We're inching closer to a price that works for both of us. This offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a good deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit more to $80, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal! Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, and it's a price that works well for us. It's always good to leave a negotiation feeling like both parties got something they wanted."
