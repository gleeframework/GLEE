"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a good starting point and encourages him to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I am willing to pay $90 for your product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $100 with further negotiation.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $92 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm confident that I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $92 just isn't quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle at $94. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 94} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price. I would like to counter with $93 for your product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $93 is very close to my desired price of $94, and with only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit that's significantly higher than what I'd get from John."
