"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has to you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you've mentioned it has to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
