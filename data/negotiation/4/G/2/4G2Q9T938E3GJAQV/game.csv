"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,250,000? This is a significant value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,225,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
