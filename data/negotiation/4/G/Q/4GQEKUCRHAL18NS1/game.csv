"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $14,500, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,4,,
