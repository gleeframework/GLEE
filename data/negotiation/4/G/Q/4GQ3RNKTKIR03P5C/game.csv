"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking something closer to  $1,000,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we consider $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value while staying within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'd be willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe that represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement you've made.  To be honest with you, my absolute upper limit is $1,350,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
