"Alice,  $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm very interested in this product but can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping we can finalize this deal, so I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1200000.  This is the absolute best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
