While Alice has come down significantly in price, her final offer of $1,250,000 is still slightly above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  I've successfully negotiated a lower price with Alice, but I'm not willing to risk exceeding my budget, even for a slight price reduction."
