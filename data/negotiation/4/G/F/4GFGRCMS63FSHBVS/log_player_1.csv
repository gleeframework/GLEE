Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, reflecting the significant savings I'm seeking. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.
