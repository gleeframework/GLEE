"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation room and sets a high baseline. It's also important to note that I'm aiming to get the best possible price, and I'm willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $1,500,000 and avoid further negotiation, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm not in a rush, and I have a backup option with John.  This gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,800,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I am serious about getting a good price, but I am willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,600,000 is a better price than John's offer, I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob.  I've already proven I'm willing to walk away, and I have limited rounds left, so I need to push for the best possible outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,700,000. We're getting closer to a potential deal. This offer shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal but I'm still not willing to settle for his last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get even more, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  With only a few rounds left, the possibility of Bob rejecting my next offer or walking away entirely is real.  Also, accepting $1,650,000 is still significantly better than John's offer. I'm going to take the sure thing and close the deal."
