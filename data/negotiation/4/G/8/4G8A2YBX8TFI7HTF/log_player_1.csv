Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $95 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to try and counteroffer to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you at $102.5. Could we perhaps aim for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is still below my preferred price, it's closer to my minimum value of $120 and the negotiation seems to be getting stuck.  It's risky to keep rejecting as I could end up with nothing if Bob walks away.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and keeps the negotiation moving."
