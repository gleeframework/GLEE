"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price and shows some flexibility.  I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that might persuade Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as I don't want to risk going too much lower and potentially losing out on a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal with John. I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
