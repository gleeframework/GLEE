"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable asset that's worth at least $1500000 to me.  My initial offer is $2000000. I'm confident this represents a strong value proposition for you.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the opportunity to consider this valuable asset. While I understand its significance to you, my valuation for the product is significantly lower. I would like to propose a price of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1500000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm confident it's still a strong value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my perspective. I appreciate the reduction, but I still believe that $1500000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to propose a final offer of $1600000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1650000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's important to both of us to reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate further. I appreciate the reduction, but I still feel that $1600000 is a reasonable price for the product. To reach a compromise, I would like to propose a final offer of $1625000. I hope this brings us closer to closing the deal.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
