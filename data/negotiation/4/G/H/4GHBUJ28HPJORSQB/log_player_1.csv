# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,750,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a commitment to move forward with the deal.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tricky decision point.  Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Offer:** $1,750,000
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Upside:**  There's still potential to get more from Bob, but it's getting riskier.

Bob is clearly anchored at a price point below $1,800,000. We are now at a point where each round carries significant risk.

```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for more, accepting $1,750,000 guarantees a significant profit over John's offer. It's better to secure a strong deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and having to settle for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
