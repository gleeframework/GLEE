"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($90) is higher than your maximum price ($80).** 
* **You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80.**  

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and secure the product at your desired price from John."
