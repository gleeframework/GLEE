"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $175?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $125 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $150. This way, we both get a good deal. ",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. $150 is still a bit too high. How about we split the difference again and I pay $137.50? This way, we're both getting closer to our desired price.",137.5,Bob,6,
