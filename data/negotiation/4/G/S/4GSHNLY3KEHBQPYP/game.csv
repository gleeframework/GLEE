"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14500? This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $12000 was a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $14500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $14500, which would be $13250. Can you consider this offer?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my previous offer.  How about $14000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your previous offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm willing to pay $13500, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,6,
