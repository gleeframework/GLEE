"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  I understand you have a budget to adhere to, but this product is truly special and offers incredible potential.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
