"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the compromise. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $11000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $10500. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your willingness to negotiate.",10500.0,Bob,4,
