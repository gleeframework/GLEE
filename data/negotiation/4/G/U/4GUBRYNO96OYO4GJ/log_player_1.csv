Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will be telling. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially asked for more. If he negotiates, you can gauge his level of interest and adjust accordingly.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
