{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $8,500. It's in great condition and worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a fair price that is slightly higher than the product's value to him. This gives me some room to negotiate while also showing that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $8,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  $8,000 is my absolute bottom line for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,250?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
