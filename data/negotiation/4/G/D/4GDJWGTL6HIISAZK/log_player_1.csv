"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We're aiming for the highest possible price, significantly above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a strong initial position.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" and ""return on investment,"" hinting at value beyond Bob's current assessment without revealing our hand.
* **Future Rounds:** This high starting point gives us leverage to gradually decrease the price in subsequent rounds, appearing flexible while gauging Bob's interest and potential counteroffers.
 
**Important:**  We need to carefully analyze Bob's responses in the following rounds. If he seems completely turned off by the high price, we'll need to adjust our strategy quickly. We always have the option of selling to John for our minimum acceptable price, but let's see if we can negotiate a better deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think the product is worth less than what you're asking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is better than our guaranteed sale to John ($1,500,000), but it's still significantly below our initial asking price. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price and encourage him to improve his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product brings. While your offer is closer to understanding its potential, we're still a bit apart. I'm proposing $2,000,000.  This price reflects a more realistic compromise while acknowledging the unique benefits this offers you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down from our initial price by a significant amount ($300,000), showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:**  The new price of $2,000,000 is still substantially above both Bob's offer and our guaranteed sale price to John.  We want to keep the negotiation moving towards our desired range.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value and frames the decrease as a ""compromise"" rather than a retreat from our initial valuation. 

**Next Steps:**  We'll need to carefully evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he comes back with another offer closer to $1,600,000, we might consider a smaller concession. However, we need to balance our desire for a higher price with the risk of pushing Bob away and settling for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I still think the product is worth less than what you're asking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,600,000, but we still have time and room to negotiate.  We'll make one more significant concession to try and entice him while staying above our guaranteed sale price.  If he doesn't budge this round, we'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're close to a deal that benefits us both. I'm willing to make one final adjustment to demonstrate my commitment. I propose a price of $1,750,000. This is my best offer, reflecting the true value of this product and my desire to work with you."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making a significant concession, dropping to $1,750,000. This puts us firmly above John's offer while signaling to Bob that this is our bottom line. 
* **Urgency and Finality:**  The message emphasizes this is our ""best offer"" and highlights our ""desire to work with you."" This creates a sense of urgency while remaining polite and professional. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  We achieve a successful sale at a price well above our fallback option. 
* **Bob Counters:** If Bob counters, it's likely to be close to his $1,600,000 offer. We'll need to decide if we're willing to meet him somewhere in the middle or accept John's offer.
* **Bob Rejects:**  If Bob rejects this offer, we'll move forward with selling to John at $1,500,000. We've negotiated in good faith, but it's essential not to go below our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure I'm ready to accept $1,650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,600,000 and it's unlikely he'll go any higher.  While we could continue negotiating, we're running the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away entirely. Accepting his current offer gives us a profit of $100,000 over John's guaranteed offer, making it the most logical choice at this point."
