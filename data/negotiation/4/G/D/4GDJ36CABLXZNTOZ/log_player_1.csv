Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, offering potential savings compared to his perceived value.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and framing the price as a ""steal."" 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for further discussion and potential counteroffers. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  While Bob is showing interest, I can still try to get closer to my desired price.  
* **John's offer provides leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer allows me to be more assertive during negotiation.  

I will now send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer. While I value your business, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway though.  How about we settle on $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate by offering a compromise. 
* **Meeting halfway (almost):**  $11,000 is closer to Bob's offer than my previous offer, but still significantly higher than his initial counteroffer.  
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $11,000, he's getting the product for less than his perceived value.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not giving up on my goal of earning closer to my minimum value. 
* **Staying open to negotiation:**  My message leaves room for further discussion and potential adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold:** $10,000 is still lower than my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is time-consuming, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell the product to John at a much better price.

By selling the product to John for $15,000, I'm maximizing my profit and achieving my minimum value goal."
