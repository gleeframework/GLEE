"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer. While I value your business, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway though.  How about we settle on $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
