"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe has significant value. I'm asking for $1800000 for it. This price reflects the potential it holds. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is significantly lower. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is far below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which still reflects the true value of the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1500000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects my genuine interest in the product and is the highest I can go at this point. Let's see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is still not enough to cover the value I've placed on this product. To demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair compromise considering your budget.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer.  While I'm willing to work with you,  $1100000 is still below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
