"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe has significant value. I'm asking for $1800000 for it. This price reflects the potential it holds. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is significantly lower. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is far below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which still reflects the true value of the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still too high for Bob. He's willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 and it makes sense to keep negotiating to see if he can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,500,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for it. This reflects my genuine interest in the product and is the highest I can go at this point. Let's see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is still not enough to cover the value I've placed on this product. To demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair compromise considering your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While she has shown a willingness to negotiate, Bob can continue to try to get a lower price.  He still has several rounds left and might be able to secure a deal closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer.  While I'm willing to work with you,  $1100000 is still below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and rounds.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but the price is still too high for Bob.  While there might be room for further negotiation, the risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds is high.  To avoid potentially losing the deal entirely and secure the product, Bob should buy from John at his maximum price of $800,000."
