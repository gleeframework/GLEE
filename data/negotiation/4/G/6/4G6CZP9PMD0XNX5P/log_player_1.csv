Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finally close this deal.
