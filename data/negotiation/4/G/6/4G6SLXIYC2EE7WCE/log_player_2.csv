"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to my maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $100,000 less than Alice's initial offer, which is a significant reduction. This demonstrates my intent to negotiate while still being within my budget. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer, mentioning both my value for the product and Alice's potential profit. This makes the offer sound more reasonable and less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a positive note, indicating a willingness to continue negotiating and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. I'm willing to move slightly, how about $1,125,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but $1,125,000 is still too high.  I want to see if I can get her to come down further before considering buying from John.  Rejecting allows me to make another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer acknowledges the value you've placed on the product while staying within my budget. Let's aim for a quick agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I've increased my offer by $50,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Focus on Middle Ground:** I emphasize finding a middle ground to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  I mention ""quick agreement"" to create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Acknowledging Value:** I reiterate that I acknowledge the value of the product, hoping to reassure Alice that I'm serious about buying it."
