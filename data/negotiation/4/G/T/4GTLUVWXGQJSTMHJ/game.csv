"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my limits. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $8,900. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still feeling comfortable with the deal. It's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that gives you a great value.  Let's make this happen. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
