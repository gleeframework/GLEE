Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's worth trying to sell to Bob at a higher price. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering it at $1,350,000 gives Bob a significant discount compared to John's offer, making it appealing. At the same time, it secures a substantial profit for me, exceeding the $1,000,000 value Bob places on it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is structured to encourage negotiation while still clearly stating my initial asking price."
