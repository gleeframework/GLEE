"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,100,000? This would still be a great deal for you, given the value you place on the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
