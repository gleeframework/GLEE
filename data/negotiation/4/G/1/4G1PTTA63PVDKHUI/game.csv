"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
