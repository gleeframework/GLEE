Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique and valuable product I'd like to offer you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,500,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price with some negotiation.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This seems like a fair price, considering the value I've placed on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,150,000?  That's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting very close.  $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1125000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,125,000 is a good deal considering it's only $25,000 less than my last counteroffer.  It's also better than the $1,000,000 I would get from John, and with only 4 rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
