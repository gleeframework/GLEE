"Bob, I have a very unique and valuable product I'd like to offer you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This seems like a fair price, considering the value I've placed on this product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1100000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1150000?  That's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close.  $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1125000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
