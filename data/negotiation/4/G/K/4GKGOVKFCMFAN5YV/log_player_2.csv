{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 1275000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still slightly above my ideal price, but it's a good compromise and within my budget.  I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
