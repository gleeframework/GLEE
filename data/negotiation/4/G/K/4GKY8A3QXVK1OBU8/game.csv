"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $105. I'm willing to pay that much for it. Can you consider it?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $105, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $115, which would be $111.5. I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",111.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $108. I'm willing to make a slightly better offer of $109. Can you consider it?",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that $110 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you at that price. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
