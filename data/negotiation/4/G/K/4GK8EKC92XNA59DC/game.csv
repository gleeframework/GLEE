"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $800000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $900000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. This is the maximum amount I am willing to pay, considering the product's worth to me is $800000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a revised price of $925000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I still feel that $925000 is slightly beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900000 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a revised price of $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to increase my offer to $910000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",910000.0,Bob,6,
