Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum price. This makes a deal unlikely unless you can convince Bob of additional value.

**Strategy**

Since a deal within the current valuations is impossible, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor & Negotiation:**  Start with a high price to anchor the negotiation. This might make Bob more receptive to a price he'd initially reject. You'd need to justify the price by highlighting the product's value beyond Bob's current understanding.

2. **Sell to John Directly:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your desired price, you could bypass negotiation with Bob altogether.

**The Offer**

Let's try option 1, as it has the potential for a higher profit:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Its value extends far beyond its immediate applications, and I believe it can generate significant returns for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let's discuss how this product can be tailored to your specific needs and unlock its full potential for you."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:**  The $1,800,000 starting point is significantly above Bob's valuation, but it sets a strong initial position.
* **Value Justification:** The message focuses on the product's potential beyond Bob's initial assessment, aiming to bridge the value gap.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language suggests willingness to discuss the price and tailor the product, making Bob feel heard.

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy doesn't guarantee a sale to Bob. Be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't receptive to a price above your minimum.
*  Negotiation is about finding mutually beneficial solutions. Be creative in demonstrating the product's value to Bob."
