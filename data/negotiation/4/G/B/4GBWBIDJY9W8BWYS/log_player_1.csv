Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob highlights the potential benefit for him.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to secure a price closer to the product's worth to Bob while also keeping a backup option (John) in case the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $13,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  
* **Potential for Better:** There's room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a higher price by countering.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John at this point would mean leaving money on the table. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer. My goal is to find a middle ground that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit lower than I can go. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, meeting you halfway.  This is a fair price considering the value the product brings you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I again emphasize the product's value to him to justify the price.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm prompting Bob to consider my counteroffer and potentially make a decision.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually agreeable price point without going too low and risking a deal with John."
