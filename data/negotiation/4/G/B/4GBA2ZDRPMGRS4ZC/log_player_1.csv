"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great value for you.  I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $135, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him see the worth in a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, showing I'm open to discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $150. While Bob's offer is better than his initial $120, it's still below my minimum.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is showing interest and is willing to negotiate. I believe there's room to get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, but there's a chance I could get closer to that with further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $125 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly counter-proposing with my own price.
* **Justification:**  I'm giving a reason for my counter-offer by highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving halfway from my previous offer of $135.
* **Encouragement:**  The question at the end (""Let's meet in the middle?"")  is a subtle way to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Quite:** Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob is clearly still interested in the product, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to take a risk to try and get a better deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** If I reject his offer, Bob may be more willing to compromise in the next round, especially if he wants the product.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his current offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's closer to your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a slight decrease from my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Reiteration of Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Encouragement:**  I'm again asking for Bob's opinion,  keeping the conversation open.
* **Close to Agreement:** At $135, I'm only $15 away from my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good opportunity to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to go down to $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We're already six rounds in, and there's a chance that continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price than I'm comfortable with.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees me my minimum, there's still a chance that Bob might increase his offer further if I reject his current offer.

**Next Round:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $138, hoping to get a deal closer to my minimum.  However, I'm prepared to accept a lower price if Bob is firm on his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $132.50 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $138, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for a slight compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's see if we can close this deal!"" adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Prepared for Acceptance:**  I'm ready to accept a price closer to $135 if Bob is firm, but hoping for a deal closer to $138."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $138. Would you be willing to go down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $135 is only $15 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've already gone through eight rounds, and continued negotiation is unlikely to get me much closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that we'll reach a stalemate, and I might end up selling to John for $150 anyway.
* **Secure a Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, secures a decent profit, and avoids further risk."
