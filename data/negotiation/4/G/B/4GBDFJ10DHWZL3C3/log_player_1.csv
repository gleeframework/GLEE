Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is closer to my minimum value of $120. This gives me more room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting that it's a ""great deal"" to emphasize the potential benefit to Bob.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer. I'll likely come down a bit, but I won't go below $120 unless I'm really desperate.
* If Bob doesn't counter, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $80. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. It's not worth it to me to sell at that price.
* **Negotiation:**  I still have room to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **John:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to close the gap but still staying above my minimum value. I will be careful to avoid going too low and risking a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95?  I think this is still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a ""great deal"" for him, highlighting the value he'd be getting.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $95 is still above my minimum value of $120. This ensures I'm not losing money on the deal.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I'll have successfully negotiated a price that's closer to my desired value.
* If he rejects it, I'll need to carefully assess his next counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing to negotiate or accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** While $90 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a bit low. 
* **Negotiation room:** I still have some room to negotiate with Bob. He's already shown a willingness to compromise, and there's a chance I can get him to go up to $95. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, which is a much better outcome than selling to Bob for $90.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for $95.  If he rejects that, I'll sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to meet you almost halfway. However, $95 is really my bottom line. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't think I can go any lower. Let me know if you're willing to take it."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. This puts pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the benefits of accepting.
* **No room for further negotiation:**  I'm stating that I can't go any lower, making it clear that there's no point in continuing to haggle.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I'll have successfully negotiated a good price.
* If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $120, as I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob."
