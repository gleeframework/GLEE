"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $80. Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95?  I think this is still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90. This would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to meet you almost halfway. However, $95 is really my bottom line. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't think I can go any lower. Let me know if you're willing to take it.",95.0,Alice,5,
