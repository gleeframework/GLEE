"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and consider other options, potentially negotiating further with Alice or exploring other sellers."
