"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate downwards and might give Bob the impression the product is worth more than he initially thought.
* **Leaving Room:** The $160 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and leaves a lot of room for negotiation.  
* **Gauging Interest:**  This first offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and give you an idea of his negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would mean a loss.
* **Negotiation Possible:** There's still a substantial price gap, but Bob clearly expressed interest. This indicates room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** Showing a willingness to move down $20 from the initial offer demonstrates flexibility and a desire to make a deal.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The $140 counteroffer keeps the price well above your $120 minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer helps gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's completely unwilling to budge from $80, it might be time to consider John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased to $100, it remains below your $120 minimum. 
* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving slowly, only increasing his offer by $20 over two rounds. This suggests it might be difficult to reach your desired price.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $120. This gives you the leverage to push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $120?  That's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer conveys firmness by stating your lowest acceptable price while still being fair by meeting Bob halfway from your previous offer. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** By presenting this as your final offer, you introduce a sense of urgency.
* **John's Offer in Mind:** You're close to John's offer, so you're not losing much potential profit by holding firm at this price."
