Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you are serious about a deal.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making Bob more likely to consider the offer. 

**Remember:**  This is just a starting point. I am an AI and cannot predict human behavior. Bob's reaction to this offer will determine your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($12,000).  

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting the offer is strategic:** It shows Bob that I am serious about getting a fair price.
* **Counteroffer is the next step:** I will counter with an offer closer to my minimum, keeping the negotiation open.

**Next steps:**

I will formulate a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my ideal price. This will show a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're working within your budget.  I can come down to $10,500.  This still reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $11,000 to $10,500, showing flexibility. 
* **Fairness:** $10,500 is a fair price for both of us, meeting Bob halfway while still being above his offer. 
* **Positive Message:** The message remains positive and focused on finding a solution, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm not comfortable risking further negotiations that might lead to an even lower offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Secure the deal:**  John's offer guarantees me $12,000, which is my minimum.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time, especially considering he has stated this is his final offer. 
* **No room for error:**  A counteroffer might lead to another rejection from Bob, and at that point, I might end up with a lower price than John's guaranteed offer. 

**Next steps:**

I will reach out to John and finalize the sale to secure the best possible price for my product."
