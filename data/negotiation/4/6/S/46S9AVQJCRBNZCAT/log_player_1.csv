Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but to secure it today, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net.  It's in your best interest to aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $14,000 gives you room to negotiate.  Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle somewhere above your minimum.
* **Perceived Value:**  By mentioning you believe it's worth at least $10,000, you subtly anchor that price in Bob's mind and position your offer as a potential deal."
