This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below my maximum price and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can meet closer to the middle."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While there's still some room below my maximum, it's getting close and the difference is no longer significant enough to risk losing the deal altogether."
