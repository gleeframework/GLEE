"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $10,000 to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective, I believe the product's value is closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will provide significant value that outweighs the price difference. I can't go as low as $11,500, but I'm willing to accept $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $12,500. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting caught up on the price.  To be frank, I have another buyer who's ready to pay $10,000. I'm offering you a chance to acquire it for a bit more, reflecting the added value I believe you'll gain.  My final offer is $11,750. This is your last chance to secure the product before I move forward with the other buyer.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not convinced that the product is worth $11,750, and I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. My final offer is $10,000. I'm willing to accept it as is.",10000.0,Bob,8,
