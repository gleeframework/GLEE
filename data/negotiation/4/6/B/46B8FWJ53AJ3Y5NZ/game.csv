"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $8,000. Let's try to find a middle ground. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and do $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. ",8500.0,Alice,5,
