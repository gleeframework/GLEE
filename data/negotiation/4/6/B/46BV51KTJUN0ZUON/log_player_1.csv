Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($120). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me room for profit. 
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm framing the offer positively, highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message doesn't close the door to further negotiation, which is crucial if Bob counters.

**Next steps:**

I will observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider whether to counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value:** Even though Bob's offer is higher than his initial perception, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. There's a chance he might increase his offer, or I might be able to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing that I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives me a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always switch to John.

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target while still being realistic about his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this time."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing value and negotiation:**  I'm raising the price from $90 to $95, demonstrating my willingness to compromise but also pushing for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reiterating that the product is a ""great deal"" for Bob, reinforcing the positive aspects and emphasizing that this price is a good deal for him.
* **Setting a clear boundary:**  I'm stating that this is ""the best I can offer at this time,"" subtly suggesting that further negotiation might be difficult. 

**Next steps:**

I will observe Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll finalize the sale. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to counteroffer again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $95 is still slightly above my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value:**  Even though Bob is willing to negotiate, his latest offer of $85 is still significantly below my minimum threshold of $120. Accepting it would result in a substantial financial loss for me.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Bob has already rejected my counteroffer of $95. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that meets my minimum requirements, especially considering his insistence on a price below $90.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John at $120 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the uncertainty and risk associated with further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale to secure a profitable outcome."
