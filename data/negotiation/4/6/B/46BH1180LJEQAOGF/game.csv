"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500?  I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product. How about we make it a deal at that price?",12000.0,Alice,5,
