"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both her value and John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer slightly above Alice's perceived value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant discount. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:**  The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere and signal that I'm genuinely interested in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down a bit, the price is still closer to my maximum budget than her value. There's likely room for further negotiation.
* **John's Price as Leverage:** I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I can't get a price closer to $9,000, as John's offer provides a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price directly in between our last two offers, signaling willingness to compromise and move the negotiation forward.
* **Stronger Language:**  The phrasing ""fair deal for both of us"" emphasizes the mutually beneficial aspect of this price point.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):**  I'm not explicitly mentioning John's offer, but pushing for a decision as I have a viable alternative if this negotiation stalls."
