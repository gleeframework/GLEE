"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our perspectives. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you and my own profit margin. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
