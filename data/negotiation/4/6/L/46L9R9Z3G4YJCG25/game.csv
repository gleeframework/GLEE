"Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is high-quality, $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,750. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Let me know if you're interested.",7750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,125. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $7,500. This is still a good price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",7500.0,Alice,5,
