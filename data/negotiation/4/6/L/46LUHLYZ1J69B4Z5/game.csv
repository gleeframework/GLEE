"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000?  This gives us both some room to be happy with the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
