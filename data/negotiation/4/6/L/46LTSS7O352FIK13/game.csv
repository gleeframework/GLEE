"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15000. It's a steal, considering its true value!  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to make it work.  How about $12000?  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price for the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to split the difference. How about $12750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
