"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us, given the potential returns you'll see.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
