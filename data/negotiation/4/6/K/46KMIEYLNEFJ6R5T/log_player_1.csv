Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
