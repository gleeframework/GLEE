Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob without losing him to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,150,000) creates a strong incentive for him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $1,150,000, there might be a small margin for negotiation if Bob counters. However, Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John."
