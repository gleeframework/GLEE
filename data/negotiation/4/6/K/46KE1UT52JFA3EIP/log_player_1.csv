Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm clear that I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer is a high starting point. If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to negotiate downwards.  
* However, I'm also aware that I have John as a backup buyer for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my desired price of $1,000,000 and even lower than my initial offer.  Accepting it would mean a considerable loss.
* **John's offer is a better backup:** I know John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is closer to my desired price.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product, and I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $950,000, perhaps $900,000.
* If he rejects my counteroffer again, I will likely accept John's offer to secure the $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $900,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I reiterate that this is a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product to him.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I use positive language to maintain a friendly and cooperative atmosphere.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, as it's still significantly higher than his initial offer but also lower than my starting point.
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will seriously consider John's offer of $1,000,000, as I'm getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my desired price, $875,000 is still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for the product.
* **John's offer is very close:**  John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is significantly closer to my desired price and much more appealing than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further price reductions, and I don't want to risk getting stuck at a low price.

**Strategy:**

* By selling to John, I secure a price that is much closer to my goal and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price.
* I'm confident that I can secure a more favorable outcome with John."
