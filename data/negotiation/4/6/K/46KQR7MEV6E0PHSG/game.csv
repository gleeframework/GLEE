"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? I feel that's a fair offer, considering my constraints.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
