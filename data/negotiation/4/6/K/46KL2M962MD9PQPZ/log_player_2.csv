"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  You can likely get a better price than $900,000, especially since Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and still leaves some room for negotiation, while also ensuring I get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

Alice has come down in price, and $875,000 is a good deal.  There's always a risk that further negotiation could get me an even better price, but it's not worth the potential for Alice to walk away, or for me to waste time."
