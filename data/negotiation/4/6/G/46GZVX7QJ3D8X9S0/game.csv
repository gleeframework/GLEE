"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1300000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1300000 doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.  Let's aim for a win-win. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit significantly. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
