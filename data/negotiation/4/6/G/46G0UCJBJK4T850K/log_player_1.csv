"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  By starting at $150, we can see how flexible Bob might be. If he outright rejects this price, we know we need to come down significantly. 

It's important to note that this is just the opening move. We are prepared to adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 matches our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. We started high, and it's unlikely Bob went straight to his maximum price. By rejecting his offer, we signal that we're looking for something closer to our initial offer. We'll use the next round to try and meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135?"", ""product_price"": 135}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're aiming for a compromise. We came down by $15 from our initial offer, signaling flexibility. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps us comfortably above our $120 minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $125, which is a reasonable compromise and provides a profit over our guaranteed sale to John.  Continuing to push for a higher price might irritate Bob, and we risk him walking away entirely. It's better to secure the deal now at a price we're happy with."
