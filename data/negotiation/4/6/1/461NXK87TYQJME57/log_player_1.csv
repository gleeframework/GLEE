Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me. 
* **The message:** This message is friendly and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. It also highlights the potential value Bob can get from the product. 

**Why this is a good starting point:**

* **It's reasonable:**  It's not too far off from Bob's perceived value, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It gives Bob some space to counter-offer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **It sets a positive tone:**  It establishes a friendly and collaborative atmosphere, which is important for successful negotiations.

I'm willing to potentially negotiate lower if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'll always keep in mind my minimum threshold of $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $12000. Would you be able to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to that number before I accept his offer.  

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I'm aiming for at least $15,000 to ensure I don't lose money compared to selling to John.
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he expressed interest in the product.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. This would still give me a good price for the product while allowing you to stay within your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $14,000 to $13,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Appealing to Bob's budget:**  I'm highlighting that $13,000 still allows him to stay within his budget. 
* **Positive and open tone:** The message remains friendly and suggests a collaborative approach to reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint:** $13,000 is a midpoint between my desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary.

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a successful deal."
