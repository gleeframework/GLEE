"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $18,000, but that's still a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $13,500.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to acquire the product.  Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,500 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm still willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you at $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's worth to me.",15000.0,Alice,5,
