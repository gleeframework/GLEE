"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and allows for potential concessions later. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value of $12,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that Bob might reject this offer. We'll see what his counteroffer looks like and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $16,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $15,200. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe we can reach a more favorable price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000. This is a further concession, but still above Bob's last offer. With only 5 rounds remaining, I want to show I'm serious about closing the deal, but I also don't want to sell too low. This counteroffer might be enough to reach an agreement, but I'm prepared to make another concession if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $15,250. While it's getting close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is on, but I'm willing to take the risk and try to get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering $15,500. This is a small concession from my previous offer but still higher than Bob's last offer. With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm also trying to see if we can find a middle ground before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm not confident we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
