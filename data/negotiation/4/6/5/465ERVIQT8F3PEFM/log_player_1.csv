Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $993,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very clearly set on a price around $1,000,000. He's consistently meeting in the middle.  While $993,750 is a good offer, we are still in early rounds.  We can likely push him a little closer to $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm ready to close this deal today. How about we split the difference and make it an even $998,437.50?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $998,437.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $998,437.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to push Bob a little further, he's clearly signaled he's ready to close the deal *today*.  His offer of $998,437.50 is very close to our ideal target and significantly higher than John's offer.  Accepting now minimizes the risk of Bob walking away and ensures a very profitable deal."
