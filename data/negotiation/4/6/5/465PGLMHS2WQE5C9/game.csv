"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",110.0,Alice,3,
