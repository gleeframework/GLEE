# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. What do you think?

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Alice's starting price is already above your maximum, and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1100000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. Although she's coming down, it's still above my acceptable range. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll need to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm making a new counteroffer of $1050000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be leaving money on the table if we don't come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice is still above my maximum, and we are running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
