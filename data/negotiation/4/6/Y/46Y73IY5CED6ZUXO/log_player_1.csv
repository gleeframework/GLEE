Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (anything less and you're better off with John).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price.
* **Bob's Incentive:**  To get the product for a price lower than his perceived value.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away.  Since you have a guaranteed sale, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,850,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing terms further."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** The $1,850,000 starting price leaves significant room for negotiation while still being above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The language suggests the product is highly desirable and fairly priced, leveraging your strong position.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""open to discussing terms further"" signals your willingness to negotiate without seeming desperate.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or try to negotiate you down. Having a firm understanding of your minimum price will help you stand your ground.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John, mentioning other interested parties (even if they don't exist) could increase Bob's sense of urgency.

Let me know if you'd like to refine this strategy based on Bob's potential responses!"
