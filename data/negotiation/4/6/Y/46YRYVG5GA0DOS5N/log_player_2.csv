"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $10,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a price closer to my budget and well below Alice's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying within my budget. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to maximize savings. By starting low, I'm signaling that I'm a serious buyer but also looking for a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation where we can hopefully meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $8,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my ideal price point. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of getting a lower price, and I risk losing the deal. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk paying the same amount to John."
