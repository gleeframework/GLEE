Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give me insight into how badly he wants the product and his potential price ceiling. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
