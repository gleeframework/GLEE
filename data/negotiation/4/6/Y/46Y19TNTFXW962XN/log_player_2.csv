Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like where we're heading, Bob! $105 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for that low. How about we try $108? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you.

Alice is clearly very intent on getting at least $108.  While I could try to push for $105, there's a risk she'll get frustrated and I'll end up paying John's $150 price.  $108 is a good deal, so it's best to accept now."
