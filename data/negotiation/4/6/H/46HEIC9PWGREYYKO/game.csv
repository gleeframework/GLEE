"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a good price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me.  How about $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get the product while ensuring I receive a decent value.  Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
