"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone can help keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking Bob what he thinks allows him to express his interest and potentially make a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible. I'll be willing to lower my price a bit in the next rounds, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $12,000. I'll be prepared to lower my price further if necessary, but I won't accept anything below $11,000. If Bob continues to be unwilling to budge, I'll consider selling to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a great deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintains my target price.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages further negotiations. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize that the price is a ""great deal"" for both parties.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get Bob closer to my desired price while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. I'll be prepared to lower my price a bit more in the next round, but I'm not willing to accept anything below $10,500.  I'll keep a close eye on the number of rounds remaining to assess when it might be more advantageous to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us. Could we possibly agree on $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is only $4,500 less than my desired price, and with only 6 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:** There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might become less willing to negotiate further, and I might end up having to sell to John for a lower profit.
* **Time Constraint:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is still an option, but with only 6 rounds left, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and secures a decent profit.

**Strategy:**

I've accepted Bob's offer because it's a good compromise that balances my desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
