Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than my minimum asking price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This still leaves plenty of profit for you while getting me a great deal.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $1,200,000. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good price and much better than selling to John.  It's time to close this deal."
