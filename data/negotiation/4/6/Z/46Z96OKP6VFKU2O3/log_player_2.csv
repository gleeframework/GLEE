"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but I'm looking to get closer to $140. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still potentially get it for less.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $132.50?  That way we're both closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
