Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** While still significantly higher than Bob's valuation, $1,400,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving potential for compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  I've secured a good price and can close the deal.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further negotiations.  If it's too low, I'll either make a counteroffer or move on to John.
* **John as a Safety Net:** The knowledge of John's offer provides a safety net and helps me remain firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. I am willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  Accepting it would mean leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates his willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can still secure a better price. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is ready to pay $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and push for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000.  I'll likely start with $1,375,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to offer the product for $1,375,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not fully meeting it. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" again to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Strong Closing:**  I'm encouraging a swift agreement with the phrase ""Let's make this happen!"".

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  I've secured a good price while also making progress in the negotiation.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll have to assess his next offer carefully and potentially adjust my strategy, considering the possibility of going with John's offer if Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to propose a price of $1,360,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is only $15,000 lower than my last counteroffer.  It's a small difference that might not be worth further negotiation.
* **Potential for Further Delays:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further delays and potentially cause Bob to lose interest completely.
* **Good Price:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,360,000 is still a good price considering my minimum value and the potential risk of Bob backing out.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer to finalize the deal and secure a good profit. While I could potentially squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of the sale is too high at this point."
