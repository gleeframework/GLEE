{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to make even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying above our minimum. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** Offering it at or above $1,000,000 ensures Bob sees potential value in the deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning other buyers subtly reminds Bob that this is a time-sensitive opportunity."
