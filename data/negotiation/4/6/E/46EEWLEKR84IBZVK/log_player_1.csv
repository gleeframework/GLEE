"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, which could make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my desired range. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be less profitable than potentially reaching an agreement with Bob closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still reflects the significant value the product offers you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm responding to Bob's offer with a counter-offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain. 
* **Open-Ended:** I'm keeping the communication open, inviting Bob to respond and potentially reach a deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000.  I'm still a little high, but I'm willing to go to $975000. Let's split the difference and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $975,000 is only $25,000 higher than his previous offer and still below my desired range.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counter-offer.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  Selling to John would be a significant drop in earnings compared to what I could potentially get from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap just a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $990,000, showing a continued willingness to compromise. This signals my desire to reach a deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that the price is fair considering the benefits he'll receive.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting really close. I'm confident we can make this deal work. I'm willing to go to $980000.  This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do. Let's seal the deal and move on to the next stage!
