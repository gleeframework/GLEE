"Alice, thanks for the offer but $12000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 might be a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but my budget is firm at $8000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to make the purchase. ",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8000. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
