"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but he should be prepared to walk away and buy from John if the price doesn't come down significantly."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 might be a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above Bob's budget. He should reject this offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for Alice to come down closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but my budget is firm at $8,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to make the purchase. "", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8000. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $9,500 is still above Bob's budget. It's clear that Alice is unlikely to budge further. Therefore, Bob should stick to his budget and buy the product from John for $8,000, securing the best deal."
