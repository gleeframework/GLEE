Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** My message emphasizes finding a price that works for both of us, making it more likely Bob will consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm giving Bob the space to counteroffer if he feels the price is too high, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, knowing I can get $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.  This gives me leverage during the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value. This will give me the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than I'd hoped to get.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This shows that I'm willing to compromise and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I reiterate that the price is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm showing flexibility to encourage a deal.
* **Open-ended Message:** My message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I've already made a significant concession.  It seems Bob isn't willing to budge much further, and further negotiations might be time-consuming and lead to a lower price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum value, I'm choosing to sell to him to ensure I get the best possible price. This allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could result in a price lower than my minimum acceptable value."
