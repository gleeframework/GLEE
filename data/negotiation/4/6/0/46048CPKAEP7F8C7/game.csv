"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than I'd hoped to get.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
