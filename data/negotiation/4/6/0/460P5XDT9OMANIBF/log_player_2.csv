"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it offers you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is tempting, you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John if you reject it. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, saving you even more money."
