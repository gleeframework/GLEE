"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155? It's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $155. I'm willing to go up to $145.  That's a fair price considering my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,
