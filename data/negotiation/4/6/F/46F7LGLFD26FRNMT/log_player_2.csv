"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to you. I'm looking to sell it to you today at a special introductory price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I would like to counter with an offer of $95 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to our target, $95 is still a bit high. Let's see if we can push Alice a little further down in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $92? That's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 92
}
```

We are inching closer to a price we both find acceptable. By framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" and ""meeting in the middle"", we hope to persuade Alice while still maintaining our position for a good price."
