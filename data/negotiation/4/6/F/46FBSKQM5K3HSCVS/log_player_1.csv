"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it will be a great asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a high opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm setting the initial price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) to have room to negotiate. Since Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm hoping he'll counter with an offer closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I can always fall back on my backup option, John, who will pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to be a bit patient and try to close the deal closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I can't go above $1,050,000. I hope this helps us move closer to a mutual agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing is not worth it.  I'm confident I can make a good profit with this deal, and it's better to close now than risk losing the sale altogether."
