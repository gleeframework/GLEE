Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to try and push for closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer for $95.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, this is a decent deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer of $80."
