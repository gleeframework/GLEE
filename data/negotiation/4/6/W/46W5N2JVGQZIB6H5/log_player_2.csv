"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $100.

You have three options:

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with. Let's try a counteroffer a little closer to her price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $90 even?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're getting closer. This offer attempts to meet Alice in the middle while still leaving a small buffer for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $95, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It seems Alice is firm on her price. While it's not the $90 I hoped for, $95 is still a reasonable deal compared to John's $120 offer."
