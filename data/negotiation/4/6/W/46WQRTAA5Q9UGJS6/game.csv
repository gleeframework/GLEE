"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,000? That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit low.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,250?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",14250.0,Alice,5,
