"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my profit.  It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so I'm taking a calculated risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, Bob's initial offer is the absolute lowest.  I still have 8 rounds left to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want.  I've only got 6 rounds left, so accepting his offer is the safest choice.  I can earn a decent profit and avoid the risk of a lower offer or running out of time."
