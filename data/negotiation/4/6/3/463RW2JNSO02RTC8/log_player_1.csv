Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to the point where I might be better off selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $1,400,000 to make this deal work. This price is still fair considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good outcome.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

We've been negotiating for a while, and we're getting close to a deal, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer in the next round. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's not the best price I could have hoped for, but it's a solid deal."
