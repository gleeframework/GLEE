"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1,500,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to gain from this deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $1,400,000 to make this deal work. This price is still fair considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good outcome.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this offer, as we're running out of rounds.  If this doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
