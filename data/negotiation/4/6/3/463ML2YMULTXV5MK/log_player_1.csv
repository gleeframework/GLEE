"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing my minimum.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still securing a deal with Bob. I'll use the remaining rounds to adjust my offer based on Bob's responses and counteroffers. I'll also keep the option of selling to John in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was wondering if you could lower the price a bit. I'm looking to spend no more than $80 on the product. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum price of $100.  It's not a viable option for me.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it provides an opportunity for further negotiation.  I can use this to try to bridge the gap and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product. 

**Strategy:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'll also consider Bob's stated budget of $80 as a factor in my counteroffer. I'll continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $95?  That gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's.
* **Fair Profit:** I'm emphasizing that I need to make a profit while still providing a good price for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. I've reduced my offer to $95, which is closer to Bob's budget and still allows me to make a profit. By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to negotiation and willing to find a solution. I'll continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm still looking for a price closer to my limit of $80. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between $80 and $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum price of $100.  While it's closer, it's not a price I can accept. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Bob's message suggests he's willing to negotiate further.  This gives me an opportunity to try and push for a higher price. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows that I'm serious about getting a fair price.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to $95, potentially $90.  I'll emphasize that I'm willing to work with Bob to reach a mutually acceptable price, but I'm also aware of John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit away from $85, but let's see if we can find common ground. How about $90? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's latest offer ($85). This shows a willingness to meet him in the middle.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Finality:** I'm hinting at the need to close the deal and suggesting that $90 could be the final price.

**Strategy:**

My goal in this round is to secure a price that's closer to my minimum while still being acceptable to Bob. I've chosen $90 as a compromise, but I'm also ready to accept $88 if needed.  If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John, as we are approaching the middle of the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to stick closer to my budget of $80. Could we possibly agree on $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum price of $100, and I'm unwilling to compromise that much.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of selling to John is increasing.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price from Bob, selling to John is becoming a more attractive option.
* **Final Negotiation:** This is likely the final round of negotiation before selling to John.  I need to make a counteroffer that's firm.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer of $90, which is a compromise closer to my minimum and reflects the potential risk of selling to John.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm very close to selling to someone else for $100.  This is truly my last offer, and I hope we can agree.  $90 is the absolute lowest I can go.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the urgency of the situation and the fact that I'm close to selling to another buyer. This adds pressure for Bob to accept the offer.
* **Finality:**  I'm clearly stating that this is my final offer, leaving no room for further negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm reminding Bob that $90 is a fair price, ensuring both parties benefit.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to convince Bob to accept the offer. By highlighting the urgency and finality of this offer, I'm hoping to push him towards agreement. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to sell to John in the next round, as I am now more than halfway through the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget of $80. I believe we might be able to reach an agreement if you could lower your price slightly. Could you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are now at Round 8, with only 2 rounds left.  The risk of not closing a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **Bob's Insistence:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to his budget of $80, and is unlikely to budge much further.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is significantly better than Bob's highest offer of $85.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit. While I would have preferred to negotiate further with Bob, the risk of not closing a deal with him is too high, and John's offer provides a safe and profitable alternative. I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
