"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is far below what I'm willing to accept for this product. How about we split the difference and settle for $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal as well."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so I don't need to settle for anything significantly less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is my absolute bottom line. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
