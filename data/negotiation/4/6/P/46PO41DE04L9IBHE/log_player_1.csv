Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's also within a reasonable range that Bob might be willing to accept given the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for less than $80. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $85. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $78 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. John is offering a guaranteed $80, which is more than Bob is offering, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
