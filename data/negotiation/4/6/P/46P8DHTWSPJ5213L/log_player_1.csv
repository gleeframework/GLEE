{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, increasing his incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget, but $11500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that considers your budget while still allowing me to get a reasonable price for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer of $11,500, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's also $500 higher than Bob's offer, allowing me to potentially secure a better price while remaining within a range that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to offer $10750.  This is a fair compromise that allows me to get a good deal while still leaving you with a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price that's closer to my desired $12,000. I believe I can get a slightly better price from Bob by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This offer is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've stuck with $11,000 as my counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price. I believe this offer is fair and will encourage Bob to reconsider his last offer."
