"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget, but $11500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair compromise that considers your budget while still allowing me to get a reasonable price for my product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to offer $10750.  This is a fair compromise that allows me to get a good deal while still leaving you with a reasonable profit.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This offer is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
