"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds for any buyer.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
