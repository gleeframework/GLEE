"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at that price? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10,200. That's the highest I can go. Can you consider my revised counteroffer?",10200.0,Bob,4,
