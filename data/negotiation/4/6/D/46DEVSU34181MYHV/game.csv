"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value to us, I propose a price of $100 for it. I understand its value to you might be around $80, but I hope this offer will be acceptable. Looking forward to your response.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay more than its perceived value to you. I am willing to consider a price of $90 for our product. This is higher than my initial offer, but still lower than the original asking price. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're looking for.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $90 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $87 for it.  I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $88 for the product? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but still below the original price. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm still committed to buying the product, but I can't go above $85.  If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to buy it now. ",85.0,Bob,6,
