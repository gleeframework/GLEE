Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but not by much. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a 2-year warranty on the product. That's a $20,000 value, absolutely free. So, the total value you'll get is $1,070,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is trying to sweeten the deal with the warranty, but the price is going back up to her previous offer.  We're getting close to our limit, and Alice seems pretty firm on staying above $1,000,000.  It's worth one more try to see if she'll come down slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate the warranty offer, Alice, but the price is creeping back up.  To be fair,  $1,010,000 is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 1010000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to throw in another sweetener - I'll include a free setup and installation service, valued at $15,000. So, the total value you'll get is $1,065,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck on her price, and even with the added services, she's not budging below $1,050,000. We're now at round 9, and it's unlikely she'll drop her price significantly in the last round. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is starting to look like the safer bet, even if it means spending a bit more than we hoped. It's better to secure the product now than risk getting stuck with no deal and potentially losing out on the product entirely."
