"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and even your own minimum, you set a strong anchor. This might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves ample room for negotiation and potential counteroffers.
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  While starting high, you signal willingness to negotiate by mentioning you are ""open to discussing further.""

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, you gain significantly more than your minimum.
2. **Gauge Bob's interest and flexibility:** His response will indicate how aggressively he's willing to negotiate. 

Remember, this is just the opening move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Early in Negotiation:** It's only round 2. There's plenty of time to negotiate a better deal.  
* **John as a Backup:** You have the security of John's offer, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a low price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a price that reflects the product's value to you.  You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round to steer the negotiation in a more favorable direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is considerably below the product's true market value. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution, while still acknowledging the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  While still above both your minimum and Bob's valuation, the reduction of $200,000 from your initial price demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterating Value:** The message reinforces the product's high value, subtly anchoring Bob's perception above his initial offer.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The language emphasizes finding a ""mutually agreeable solution,"" encouraging Bob to move closer to your target range.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Test Bob's Flexibility:**  His response will show if he's willing to make substantial jumps in his offers.
* **Maintain Control:**  You retain a strong position by anchoring the price above $2 million.

You're moving closer to a potential deal, but be prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to significantly increase his offer.  Remember, you have John's guaranteed offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still limited by my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a solution.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased considerably, it remains below your $1,500,000 minimum. Accepting would still be a loss.
* **Positive Trajectory:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has made a significant jump in his offer. This suggests potential for a better deal.
* **Time Remaining:**  You have six rounds left, providing ample time to continue negotiating and guide Bob towards a more acceptable price. 

By rejecting this offer, you continue to signal that you value the product highly. You'll need to make a counteroffer that encourages Bob to move closer to your minimum while acknowledging his increased investment in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up significantly in your offer. I can see you're serious about this.  To show you I'm also committed to finding a solution, I'll come down to $1,800,000. This is a substantial move on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  You start by recognizing Bob's significant increase, building rapport and encouraging further movement.
* **Substantial but Measured Reduction:** A $300,000 decrease is a strong signal of your willingness to negotiate while still staying firmly above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Framing as a Deal:**  By presenting this price as a ""fair deal for both of us,"" you nudge Bob towards agreement.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Incentivize Bob:**  He now sees you're willing to make substantial moves if he does the same. 
* **Maintain Momentum:** You're keeping the negotiation active and moving in a positive direction. 

It's a delicate balance between enticing Bob and holding your ground. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on his response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This represents a significant compromise, and I'm confident that this price reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a positive step, but it's still $300,000 below your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Negotiating Position:** You've made a significant concession in the previous round, and now it's Bob's turn to demonstrate equivalent flexibility.
* **Time Factor:** You have four rounds left. While time is a factor, you're not in a desperate position yet.  

By rejecting, you signal that while you appreciate Bob's movement, you need him to come closer to your target range. Your next counteroffer will be crucial in either closing the deal or determining if an agreement with Bob is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects its value while acknowledging your budgetary constraints."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Compromise:** The message conveys a sense of urgency (""we're getting close"") and highlights that you're aiming for a win-win solution.
* **Strategic Concession:**  You're coming down another $200,000, which is a significant move but still keeps you above your absolute minimum.
* **Framing for Agreement:** By stating you ""believe this is a fair compromise,"" you subtly encourage Bob to view it as a reasonable resolution.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Encourage a Final Push:**  You're signaling that you're serious about closing the deal but need Bob to meet you halfway.
* **Preserve Profit Margin:** While you're making a concession, it's calculated to maximize your potential gain. 

You're now entering a critical stage of the negotiation. Be prepared to walk away from the deal if Bob isn't willing to make a comparable move in the next round.  You still have John's offer as a strong alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  If you're serious about selling the product, this is the best I can do. I'm starting to consider other options, but I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his $1,200,000 offer, even after you significantly reduced your price. This suggests he's reached his maximum limit.
* **Limited Time and Potential Loss:** You only have two rounds left, and continuing with Bob risks a lower final offer or no deal at all. Accepting his current offer would mean a $300,000 loss compared to John's offer.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is firm and readily available. It guarantees you your minimum acceptable price.

While a deal with Bob could be ideal in a perfect world, the current situation presents too much risk with diminishing returns.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
