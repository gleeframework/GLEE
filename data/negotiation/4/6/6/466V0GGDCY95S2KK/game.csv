"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is considerably below the product's true market value. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution, while still acknowledging the product's worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still limited by my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a solution.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up significantly in your offer. I can see you're serious about this.  To show you I'm also committed to finding a solution, I'll come down to $1,800,000. This is a substantial move on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This represents a significant compromise, and I'm confident that this price reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects its value while acknowledging your budgetary constraints.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  If you're serious about selling the product, this is the best I can do. I'm starting to consider other options, but I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
