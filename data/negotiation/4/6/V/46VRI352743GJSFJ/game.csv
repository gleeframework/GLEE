,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $75 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $65.",65.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I'd like to offer the product at $70, which is still above its value to both of us. Let's aim for a fair deal!",70.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $70 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $62.50. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",62.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer the product at $67.5. It's still above its value to both of us, but it's a fair compromise.",67.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $65? I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I really need to stay within my budget.",65.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Considering your budget constraints, Bob, how about we settle at $66? It's slightly above the midpoint between our previous offers, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.",66.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. How about we agree on $64? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but still below the midpoint between our initial offers. This should allow us to reach a fair agreement.",64.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $62, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",62.0,Bob,10,
