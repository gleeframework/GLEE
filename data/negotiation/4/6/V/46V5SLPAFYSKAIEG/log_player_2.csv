"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's always worth trying to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better price from Alice.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer, but it's worth the risk to try and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000  gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling pressured.  It's a bold move, but if Bob is lucky, it could lead to a successful deal that saves him a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still determined to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer gives him another chance to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $1,000,000.  It's a calculated risk, but the potential savings are worth the effort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's already rejected Alice's offer of $1,100,000 and  wants to meet her halfway. Offering $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise and could be a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $1,050,000. It's getting close to his target price, and continuing to negotiate might not yield much more savings. At this point, it's a good deal considering the alternative of buying from John for $1,500,000. It's wise for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a significantly lower price."
