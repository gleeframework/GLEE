``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me.  If he rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8000 for it. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still offers you a great value, and it's closer to my bottom line. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to meet at that price point. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I believe there's still room for further negotiation.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
