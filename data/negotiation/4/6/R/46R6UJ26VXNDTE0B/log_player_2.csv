"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than what John is offering. You can save a significant $200,000 by going with John.  Alice's mention of another buyer is likely a negotiation tactic."
