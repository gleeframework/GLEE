"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is cheaper than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering $110 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate. This counteroffer is also within Bob's budget, as he's willing to spend up to $150.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point.  While $130 is still more than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's a better deal than buying from John for $150.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, but the risk of losing the product to another seller is not worth the potential for a few more dollars saved."
