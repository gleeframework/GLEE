"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while also giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the product's true value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us considering the substantial return you stand to gain.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe we're nearing the point where further negotiation might not be fruitful. To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer interested at a lower price point.  However, I value our conversation and believe in the synergy we've built. My final offer is $1,125,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
