"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $1,250,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and generate significant value for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
