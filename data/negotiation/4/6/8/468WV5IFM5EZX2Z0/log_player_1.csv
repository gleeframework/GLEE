Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I highlight the value of the product to him, making it clear that this is a good deal for him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting high, I have room to negotiate downwards while still earning a decent profit. 
* **Keep Bob interested:** Offering a discount makes the deal more attractive to Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Avoid rushing to John:** By starting the negotiation with Bob, I can potentially reach a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,200,000 I initially offered. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's more in line with my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,150,000?  I believe this is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering $1,150,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and  makes the offer seem fair to both parties. 
* **Reaffirming value:** I reiterate that the price is still a good value for Bob, making it clear that I'm not just trying to maximize my profit.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I end with a question to keep the dialogue open and encourage further negotiation. 

This approach aims to:

* **Move towards my target:** $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's a step closer to my ideal price.
* **Show flexibility:** By meeting Bob halfway, I demonstrate that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit below my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even though I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations.  

Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially wasting time, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures that I meet my minimum price requirement and maximize my profits."
