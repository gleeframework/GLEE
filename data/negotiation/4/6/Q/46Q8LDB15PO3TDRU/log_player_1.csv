Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, giving Bob room to counteroffer. It's also a good starting point for negotiation since I still have the option to sell to John if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to accept anything less than $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  It's still a good deal for you considering its value, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $9,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my target price of $10,000. It's a good compromise and a win for me considering I could have sold to John for $10,000."
