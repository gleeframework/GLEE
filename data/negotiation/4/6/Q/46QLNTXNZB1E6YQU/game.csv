"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $1,075,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to find some common ground. I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,162,500. It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1162500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,162,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm getting close to selling to John, but I'd prefer to make a deal with you. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll be forced to move forward with John.  What's your final decision?",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need you to throw in some extras or concessions to sweeten the deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
