Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
