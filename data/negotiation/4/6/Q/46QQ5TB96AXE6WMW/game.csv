"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Based on its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1200000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's capabilities. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1000000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
