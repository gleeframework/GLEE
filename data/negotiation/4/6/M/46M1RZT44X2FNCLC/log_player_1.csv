Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and encouraging, while also highlighting the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a high price and see if I can get Bob to agree. If he rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your value for the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $90.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $95? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $95, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a decent price.
* **Message:** I'm reaffirming my appreciation for Bob's interest and emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and agree to buy the product at this price. If he rejects again, I might consider lowering my offer slightly, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could continue to negotiate,  it's clear that Bob is not willing to go much higher. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $100, it's in my best interest to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
