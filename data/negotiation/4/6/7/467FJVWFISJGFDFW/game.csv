,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, acknowledging your interest in the product.  This price still gives me a reasonable profit while remaining fair to you. Let's work together to find a solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 as a final compromise. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",850000.0,Alice,5,
