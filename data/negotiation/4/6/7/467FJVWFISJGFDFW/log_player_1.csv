"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This sets a high bar for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and focuses on the value proposition for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates I'm open to discussion, leaving room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This opening offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If he rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds while still keeping my profit margin.  If he accepts, I maximize my profit. I also have the option to sell to John if Bob is not willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While Bob's offer is far too low, the fact that he's counter-offering shows he's interested in the product.  I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Time is on My Side:**  I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me time to gradually lower my price while still aiming for a profit. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair price.  I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that balances my profit goals with Bob's perceived value. I am also keeping in mind the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, acknowledging your interest in the product.  This price still gives me a reasonable profit while remaining fair to you. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Profit:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Show Flexibility:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $900,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlight Fair Value:** I'm framing $900,000 as a fair price for both of us, emphasizing the product's value and my willingness to find common ground.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer, I'm pushing Bob to increase his offer while remaining firm on my desired profit margin.  The $900,000 price point leaves room for further negotiation and allows me to assess Bob's commitment. I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary but hoping to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown some willingness to increase his offer. It's likely that with further negotiation, I can reach a price closer to my target.
* **Limited Rounds:** I have 6 rounds remaining, which is a significant number, allowing for more back-and-forth.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer again, I demonstrate that I'm committed to getting a fair price.  I will counteroffer again in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me. If Bob continues to reject offers that are too low, I have the option of selling to John as a backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 as a final compromise. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Final Compromise:** I'm framing this offer as a final compromise, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept. 
* **Positive and Forward-Looking:** The message ends with a positive and forward-looking tone, encouraging Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards accepting a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping that with this offer, which is still more favorable to me than selling to John, Bob will realize the value of the product and agree to the deal.  However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John if necessary in the remaining rounds."
