"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I see the potential in this product,  $2,300,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, recognizing the value it holds for you.  This is the highest I can go.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too far below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's say $1,900,000. This accounts for the value it offers both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, recognizing the potential of the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and should be a good compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still out of my range.  I can go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and shows my commitment to finding common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm determined to make this deal work, but  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000,  which is a significant increase from my last offer and reflects my genuine interest in this product.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
