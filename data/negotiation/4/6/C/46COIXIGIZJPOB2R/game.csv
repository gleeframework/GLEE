"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that is both fair and advantageous. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
