Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows me to potentially earn a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,999 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" while still prioritizing my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While not explicitly stated, there might be a slim chance Bob would counter-offer slightly higher, getting me closer to my $15,000 goal.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limitations beyond his product valuation."
