"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our flagship product, which I believe will significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value to you, we understand it's worth $15,000. Considering our commitment to fair transactions and the exceptional quality of our product, I propose a price of $12,000 for this opportunity. This offer reflects a strategic balance between maximizing my earnings and ensuring you receive a valuable asset at a competitive rate. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and John's offer. While her message is persuasive, it's important to stay focused on your financial goals. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with buying from John."
