"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm proposing a price of $13,500 for the product. I think this is a fair middle ground that still reflects its value to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth the investment.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects its value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",13000.0,Alice,5,
