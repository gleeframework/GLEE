"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can do $1200000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
