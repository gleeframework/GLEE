"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9000. This is a great price for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a great deal for you as well.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8750 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to reduce the price to $9000, which is the original offer I made, minus a small concession. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're still trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $9500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know you're willing to meet me at this price.",9500.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher.

"Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know you're willing to meet me at this price.",10000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $10000. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm still above my budget. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I think it's time to consider other options, like buying from John for $12000. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, but that's as low as I can go.",9500.0,Bob,10,
