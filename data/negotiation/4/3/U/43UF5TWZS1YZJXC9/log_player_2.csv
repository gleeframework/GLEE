"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, so paying $140 is still a good deal. However, you want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is now offering it for $135. This is a good deal for you, especially since you can save $15 compared to buying from John."
