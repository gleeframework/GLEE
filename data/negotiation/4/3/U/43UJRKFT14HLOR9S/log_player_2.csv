"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is well above his maximum budget, and he has a better alternative with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get a better deal from John for $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Even though Alice is willing to negotiate, she's still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay. John's offer of $10,000 is the best deal available for Bob at this point."
