{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** Offering $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Flexibility:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately resorting to John's offer.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes a mutually beneficial deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind my minimum value and John's offer as benchmarks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target while still being reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $900,000 is a good start, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the deal with you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising the price to $950,000, which is closer to my target but still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering his initial offer.
* **Message:** I'm staying polite and emphasizing the fairness of the deal, creating a sense of compromise. 
* **Negotiation:** I believe this counteroffer strikes a good balance, allowing for further negotiation without alienating Bob completely. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and make my next decision based on his acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $925,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's so far below what the product is worth to me. There's still a possibility of reaching a better deal with Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safe and secure option, I'm still willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than his last offer while still being reasonable and ensuring it's closer to my minimum value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $940,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $940000. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $920,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems like Bob is unwilling to budge further, and I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:** 

I've reached a point where the potential for a better deal with Bob is very low.  John's offer provides a secure and profitable outcome. Selling to John is the best option at this point."
