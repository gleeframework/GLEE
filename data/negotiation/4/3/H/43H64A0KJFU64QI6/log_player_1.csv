Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below the value to Bob, but above my minimum, giving room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation by showing I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $10,000. I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That way, we can both be happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum price.  While I would prefer more, accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or the potential of having to sell to John for the same price."
