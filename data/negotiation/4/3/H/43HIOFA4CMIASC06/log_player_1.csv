Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It acknowledges that Bob values the product higher than you, but also demonstrates that you are not willing to give it away cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $8,500 is higher than John's offer, it is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $9,000 is still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum and higher than John's offer.  It's time to secure the deal."
