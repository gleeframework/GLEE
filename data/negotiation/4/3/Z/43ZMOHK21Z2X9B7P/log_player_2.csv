"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a discounted price of $11,500. I think it could be very valuable for you, and this offer is a steal compared to its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $10,000."
