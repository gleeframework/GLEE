Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is moving closer to our desired price, so we'll continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To show my willingness to close this deal, I'm proposing $1,000,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** We're sending a signal that we're serious about the $1,000,000 mark by labeling it as our ""final offer."" This adds weight to the negotiation.
* **Above John's offer:** We're still comfortably above our fallback option of selling to John for $800,000. 
* **Testing Bob's resolve:** This offer will reveal if Bob is truly willing to meet us near our desired price point.  If he rejects this, we can reassess in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal gains vs. risk:** While holding out for more than $975,000 is tempting, Bob has signaled his firm stance. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant increases at this point and risks losing him as a buyer.
* **Strong profit:** $975,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Time value of money:** Closing the deal now ensures prompt payment and avoids further time and effort spent on negotiation."
