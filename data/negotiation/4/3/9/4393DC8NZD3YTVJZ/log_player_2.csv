"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset at a competitive price. Please consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident you'll see the value it holds.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most cost-effective option."
