"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This price is above my minimum threshold of $100, and leaves room for potential negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value, so there's a good chance he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum threshold, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get a better price, especially considering Bob values the product at $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a healthy profit margin for me.  I believe this is a fair price that will entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm confident I can get a slightly better price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

I'm dropping the price to $108. This is a small concession, but I'm hoping it's enough to sway Bob.  At this price, I'm still making a profit, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is getting close to my bottom line.  While I'd prefer a bit more,  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
