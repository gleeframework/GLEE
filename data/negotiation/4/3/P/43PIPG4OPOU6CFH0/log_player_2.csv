"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.
* There are still rounds left, so Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  This is the highest I'm able to go at this time."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* There are still rounds left, but Bob is already at a point where he can secure the product for his maximum budget by buying from John.
* Given the possibility of further negotiation with Alice, Bob might risk not being able to acquire the product for his maximum budget.
* Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product now from John at his maximum budget."
