"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision to purchase it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and the potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good compromise. 
* It's still within your budget and a decent deal. 
* Going to John would cost you $1,000,000. 
* There's a chance Alice will not accept your counteroffer, so accepting this offer is the safest option."
