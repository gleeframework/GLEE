"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay something closer to $6,000. What do you say?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
