Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further. There's a good chance I can get a slightly better price from Bob, even if it's just a few dollars more."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but I need the price to be closer to my budget.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob seems pretty set on a price well below my $100 minimum.  It's unlikely he'll come up significantly in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
