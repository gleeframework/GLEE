"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still provides you with a valuable product at a reasonable cost.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That would make it work on my end.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary concerns. However, $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than the value I see in the product.  Let's compromise at $1,200,000. This price reflects the value you mentioned you see in the product, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
