"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value for the right individual.  While I can't disclose the exact nature of it right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me.  I'm confident that with your expertise and vision, it could be even more valuable for you. I'm open to negotiating a fair price, but I'm hoping to receive at least $1000000 for it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance, so please consider it carefully. ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
