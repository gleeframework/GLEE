{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's estimated value:** This makes the deal attractive to him and increases the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price based on Bob's response. 

Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired price. Rejecting this offer allows you to try and push for a higher price.  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to compromise but not settling for a significantly lower price.
* **Is still below your initial offer:** It demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Is presented with a clear justification:**  It highlights the value of the product and aims to find a price that feels fair to both parties. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway!"
