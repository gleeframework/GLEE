{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you, given its potential to [briefly explain the product's value to Bob]. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,250,000 as my initial offer. This is a significant amount above my minimum of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I've included a message that:
    * Acknowledges Bob's potential interest by mentioning the product's value to him.
    * Highlights the fairness of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
    *  Encourages a response from Bob. 

**Rationale:**

* **Starting high:** By starting at a higher price, I leave room for negotiation and create the impression that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Fairness:**  By emphasizing fairness, I hope to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Keeping options open:**  I haven't explicitly mentioned John yet, but the fact that I'm willing to negotiate with Bob shows I'm open to finding a deal, but I'm not tied to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price of $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, I signal that I am not desperate to sell and that I'm confident I can find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're working with a budget.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? This would allow me to meet my minimum price while still giving you a very competitive price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints, but I'm also reiterating the product's value and my need for a fair return. I've suggested a compromise price that is still above my minimum.
* **Price:** I've offered $1,150,000, which is a halfway point between my last offer of $1,250,000 and Bob's current offer of $1,050,000.

**Rationale:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a compromise, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to work with Bob.
* **Fairness:** The price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring that I'm getting a good deal.
* **Pressure:** The counteroffer puts the pressure back on Bob to either accept or make a higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to move a bit higher, how about $1,100,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,150,000.  While I'd prefer to get even closer to my desired price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a good deal while also avoiding further negotiation and potential risks.

**Rationale:**

* **Time & Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process and increase the risk of Bob walking away or finding another seller. 
* **Good Deal:** $1,100,000 is still a good price, significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Better:**  While there's always the possibility of getting a slightly higher price, the chances of that happening are uncertain.

Therefore, it's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
