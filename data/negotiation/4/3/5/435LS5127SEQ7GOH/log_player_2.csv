Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're working with a budget.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? This would allow me to meet my minimum price while still giving you a very competitive price for such a valuable product.
