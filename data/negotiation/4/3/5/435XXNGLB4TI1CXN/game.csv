"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you.  It's something that you've expressed interest in before, and I know it's worth at least $12000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to earn a bit more than my minimum and you can get your hands on something you really want.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
