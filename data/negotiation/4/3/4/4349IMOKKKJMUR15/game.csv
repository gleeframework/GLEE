"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, and I believe that's a fair price considering my maximum spending limit.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $1,025,000? This would be a good compromise, and we can close the deal quickly.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
