"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while I still get a decent price. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a win.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $850,000 is my absolute minimum.  This price still allows you a good margin for profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and it keeps us both reasonably happy.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $750,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000.  This price gives you a decent profit margin, and it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,
