Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $850,000 is my absolute minimum.  This price still allows you a good margin for profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $750,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000.  This price gives you a decent profit margin, and it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.

At this point, Alice has met my highest acceptable price.  There's no point in further negotiation as she's unlikely to go lower. I can get the same price from John without further negotiation."
