Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $7,800? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.

Alice's offer:

Alice is clearly trying to come down in price, and $7,600 is a decent compromise. It's getting close to John's price, and further haggling might not yield much better results."
