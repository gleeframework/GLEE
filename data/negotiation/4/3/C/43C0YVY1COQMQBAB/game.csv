"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $7,800? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",7800.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to get closer to your desired price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,400? ",7400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $7,400 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  Would you consider $7,600? This would be a fair price for both of us.",7600.0,Alice,5,
