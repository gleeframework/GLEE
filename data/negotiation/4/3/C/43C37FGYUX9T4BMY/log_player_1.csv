"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to push for a higher price. $1,800,000 is still above my minimum, and Bob seems interested. I'll see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is coming down in price, but I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,700,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference again -  I'm willing to accept $1,800,000. This would be a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1650000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting them, he'll walk away entirely. While I'd prefer to get more than $1,500,000, it's better to secure the deal with John now. I'm confident I can find another buyer later who will be willing to pay closer to my original asking price."
