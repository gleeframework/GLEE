Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it really valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you'd still be making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so there's space for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially reach a price that benefits you both. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It quickly conveys your offer and invites Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than your minimum of $80 and it's a good deal considering he initially rejected your offer of $100. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a profit."
