Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** I'm starting with the full value of the product for Bob. This shows confidence and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** Mentioning ""fair price"" subtly positions me as reasonable and willing to find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for further discussion and potential counteroffers. 

This strategy is designed to maximize my chances of getting the full value while also leaving room for a win-win negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:**  I'm determined to get at least $1,000,000 for the product.  Bob's offer falls short of that.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, it shows he's interested.  I can likely negotiate a better price with him in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have a chance to improve the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $950,000 for the product.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm presenting a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's.  This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Positive Framing:** The ""fair compromise"" and ""happy"" language keeps the tone positive and encourages Bob to see the offer as beneficial for both of us.
* **Slightly Higher:**  I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value, showing that I'm not desperate to sell quickly. 

This counteroffer should maintain Bob's interest while pushing for a more favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's counteroffer is now closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away altogether. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup.  This allows me to accept Bob's offer without feeling pressured.

While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and gets me close to my goal. It also avoids the risk of losing a deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
