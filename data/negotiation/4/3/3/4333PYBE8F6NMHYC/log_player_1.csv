"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm looking for a price around $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  This anchors the negotiation at a higher point. Even though it's significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, it gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Gauge Reaction:** Bob's reaction will provide valuable information. If he outright rejects it, you know you need to come down significantly. If he counters, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.
* **John Option:**  You always have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in these initial rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is still $5,000 above his perceived value. This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Time is on Your Side:** You are only in Round 2 of 10. There's ample time to engage in back-and-forth negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John will buy for $12,000 gives you a strong fallback position, allowing you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Step:** You should make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your target while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I value the product highly, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? "",
""product_price"": 16500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're coming down from your initial offer, signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate. However, the concession is not too drastic, keeping you well above both your minimum and his initial offer.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing technique aims to present your counteroffer as a fair compromise, even though it's still significantly in your favor.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** You're keeping the negotiation active, encouraging Bob to counter again and potentially move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $16,500. How about we meet at $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $16,000 is a significant profit margin over your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and a solid return on the product.
* **Bob's Limit?:**  Bob has now increased his offer twice. While he might still be willing to negotiate further, there's a risk he might walk away if you push too hard.
* **Time Value:**  While you have time remaining, closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds and secures your profit. 

**Overall:** Accepting $16,000 represents a favorable outcome for you in this negotiation."
