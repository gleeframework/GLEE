"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $105. How about $108? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $112? It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's close this deal!",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make it $110 and seal the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
