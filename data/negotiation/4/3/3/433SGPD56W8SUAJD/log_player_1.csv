"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I know the product is worth more to him, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $105. How about $108? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $108 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $112? It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make it $110 and seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, we are at the midpoint of the negotiation, and I have only 4 rounds remaining. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $110 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal."
