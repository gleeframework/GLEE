Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too pricey for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $110 is far below my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $130?  This is a great product, and I think it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. It's a nice product, but $130 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum price, and it's a good deal for both of us. Accepting his offer is the best option in this round."
