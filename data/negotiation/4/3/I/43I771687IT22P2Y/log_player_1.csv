Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Initial Price:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000,  I can afford to start with a higher asking price to test Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, giving me room to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding my minimum price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always propose a lower price, moving closer to my minimum of $1,200,000."
