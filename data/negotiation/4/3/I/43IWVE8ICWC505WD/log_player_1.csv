Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts by setting a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but it's also less than your minimum price ($150). This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still securing a decent profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't pay more than $150. Would you consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is your minimum price, so accepting it is the best option.  You'll get your minimum profit, and you avoid the risk of further negotiation."
