Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $115. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's still profitable for you. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a backup who will pay your desired minimum price."
