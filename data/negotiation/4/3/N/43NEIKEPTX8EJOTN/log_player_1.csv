Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start high. Aiming significantly above Bob's perceived value might make him reconsider and still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Scarcity tactic:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message implies it's worth considering the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is aggressive. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, you'll fall back on your guaranteed sale to John.
* Observe Bob's reaction to this initial offer. His response will guide your next move and potential negotiation tactics."
