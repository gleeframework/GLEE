Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product at $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) is unlikely to be accepted.  A price closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) is ideal.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your offer.

The offer of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price."
