"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we start at $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This is a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction quickly.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $9,250. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,875.  This is a fair compromise, and it's a good price for both of us.  Let's make a deal and move on.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8,875 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's try $9,125. That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's get this deal done.",9125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,125 is still a bit high for me.  We've both made concessions, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it lets us finalize the deal quickly.",9000.0,Bob,8,
