"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we start at $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start strong:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the range where a deal is possible.

* **Set the tone:** This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal and am willing to negotiate."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This is a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still holds some ground for further negotiation.
* **Appeal to Efficiency:** Mentioning a quick finalization encourages Alice to agree, as it minimizes further negotiation rounds and time spent.
* **Reiterate Value:** ""Good deal for both of us"" subtly reinforces the mutually beneficial nature of the proposed price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $9,250. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $8,500.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I want to see if I can push her down further.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better price.  I still have time before I need to resort to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,875.  This is a fair compromise, and it's a good price for both of us.  Let's make a deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm offering a small increase from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement but not willing to concede too much.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8,875 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's try $9,125. That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's get this deal done.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I'm still within the range where I can get a better deal.  I've got a few rounds left before I need to resort to John, so I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can convince Alice to go lower.  I can still potentially get the product for closer to my desired price of $8,500."
