Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we start at $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum and it's a good deal for both of us.
