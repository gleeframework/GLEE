Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is still far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to facilitate a deal. This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum acceptable amount. I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle on $925,000. This would be a fair compromise and allows us to move forward with the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the right price for me. How about we try $900,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's getting increasingly difficult to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob. I've already made multiple concessions, and he seems unwilling to budge on his price.  To ensure I receive my minimum desired value for the product, I will sell it to John for $1,200,000."
