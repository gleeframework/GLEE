"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is still far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to facilitate a deal. This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle on $925,000. This would be a fair compromise and allows us to move forward with the deal. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the right price for me. How about we try $900,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,6,
