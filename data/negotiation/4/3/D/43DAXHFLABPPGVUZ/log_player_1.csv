"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to understanding your perspective on the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not outrageous):**  We begin significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as a starting point and emphasizes the product's unique value, potentially justifying the high initial ask.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language used (""open to understanding your perspective"") signals a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in a multi-round process. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor high:**  Starting high can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather information:** Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer) will provide valuable information about his willingness to pay.
3. **Maintain flexibility:** We have plenty of rounds to negotiate and the fallback option of John ensures we don't settle for less than our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, signaling he's willing to negotiate. However, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

It's too early in the negotiation to accept an offer this low or to walk away with the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  By rejecting and countering, we can:

* **Test Bob's flexibility:** We need to see how high Bob is willing to go.
* **Maintain a strong position:** Accepting his offer now might indicate you're willing to settle for much less.

We have ample rounds to negotiate a better deal, and John's offer acts as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial price reflects the unique aspects and potential of this product that I believe strongly justify a higher figure.  To move things forward, I can offer it to you for $1,950,000. This is a significant adjustment, demonstrating my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** We're decreasing our price by $300,000, a substantial move to show flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's unique value to justify a price above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Positioning:**  The new price is still comfortably above your $1,500,000 minimum and provides room for further negotiation.
* **Urgency (Subtle):**  Phrases like ""to move things forward"" subtly introduce a sense of progress and potential agreement.

By making a significant concession while still holding a strong position, we aim to:

1. **Encourage Bob's engagement:** The large price drop might make Bob more willing to negotiate upwards.
2. **Maintain value perception:** We haven't dropped the price too low, preserving the image of a high-value product.
3. **Continue strategic negotiation:**  We're aiming for a win-win, but we're prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, accepting now guarantees a substantial profit. Here's why this decision makes sense:

* **Profitable Deal:**  A $1,400,000 sale price is a $400,000 profit, exceeding your minimum requirement.
* **Reduced Risk:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling, leaving you with John's $1,500,000 offer. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner allows you to reinvest the capital and potentially generate further returns.

While there's a chance of securing a higher price, the current offer represents a strong balance of profit and minimizing potential downsides."
