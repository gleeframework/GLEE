"Alice, your initial offer is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

However, my initial price reflects the unique aspects and potential of this product that I believe strongly justify a higher figure.  To move things forward, I can offer it to you for $1,950,000.
