"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  I could meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a very fair offer considering the quality and potential of this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
