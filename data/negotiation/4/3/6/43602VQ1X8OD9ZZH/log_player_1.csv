Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset for you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close the deal.

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is still a tough pill to swallow. How about we compromise at $14,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $14,000 mark I need. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk Bob walking away."
