Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $17,000 for it, given its value and unique features. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $17,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I'm hoping to get. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $15,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable settling for less than $15,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $14,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure if I can get him to go any higher. To ensure I get my minimum desired price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
