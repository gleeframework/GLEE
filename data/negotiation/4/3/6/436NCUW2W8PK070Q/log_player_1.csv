Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, aiming for my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh it against selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counteroffer to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need to make a profit.  $11,500 is a fair middle ground, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in that."

Bob is firm on his offer, and I'm not willing to go lower. I've already made two counteroffers, and it seems like we're at an impasse. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, selling to him is the best option to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
