"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as the product is worth more to her than to you."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. John is offering the product for $800,000, so you have a good baseline to work with."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another option available to me."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm willing to wait for the right buyer if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

At this point, you should go with John's offer.  Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $925,000, which is still above your limit.  John's offer of $800,000 is the best deal available to you."
