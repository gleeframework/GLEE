Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm initially offering it to you at $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's better to continue negotiating or sell to John.  Let's see if we can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $175? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is the same as what John is offering.  It's not a great deal, but it's the best option available right now. Let's go with it."
