,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $175? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",150.0,Bob,4,
