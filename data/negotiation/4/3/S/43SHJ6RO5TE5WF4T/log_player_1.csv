I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

$70 is too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I need to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will get us closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is still too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm getting closer to John's offer of $100, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $100 yet.  I'll make another counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a further compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a better price than John's offer of $100.  If Bob rejects this, I will likely accept John's offer."
