{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, but she's offering it for $950,000. This means there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $800,000 limit as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. Starting with $850,000 shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying but also willing to pay a fair price, considering the product's worth to Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's determined to get the price down closer to his $800,000 target.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to achieve this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from $850,000 to $875,000, showing he's willing to compromise. This demonstrates his genuine interest while still remaining within his budget. He's hoping to find a middle ground with Alice, making a deal before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $990,000 is still outside Bob's comfort zone. It's important to remember that Alice is willing to sell for lower than her own valuation, and there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue pushing for a better price before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, demonstrating his desire to reach a deal. Offering $900,000 shows Alice that he's serious about buying, but he still believes there's room for Alice to compromise. This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Alice's previous offers, potentially pushing Alice to make a final counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,005,000 is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still too high.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of not getting a better price increases.  Since John offers the product for $800,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's the most logical choice at this point to avoid further negotiation with Alice."
