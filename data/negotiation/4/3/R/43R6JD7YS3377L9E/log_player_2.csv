"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $120 from John if necessary. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer."
