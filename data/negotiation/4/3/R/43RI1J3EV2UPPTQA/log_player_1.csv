Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start with a price significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of scarcity and desirability by mentioning ""other interested parties."" This might push Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Confidence, Not Desperation:**  The tone is confident and emphasizes the product's value. You're not desperate to sell, even though you have a backup buyer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This strategy assumes you have no prior information about Bob's negotiation tactics. If you knew he was extremely price-sensitive, you might adjust your approach.
* **Relationship Building:** This offer is very transactional. If you value a long-term relationship with Bob, you might consider a slightly less aggressive opening offer."
