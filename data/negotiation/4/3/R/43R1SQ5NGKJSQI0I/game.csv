,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That seems like a fair compromise given where we both are.",9000.0,Bob,4,
