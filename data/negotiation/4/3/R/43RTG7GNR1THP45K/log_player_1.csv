Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to pay a premium. 

However, I'm prepared to negotiate if he counteroffers, as my goal is to maximize my earnings.  I'll be keeping a close eye on the negotiation and considering John's offer of $800,000 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with the $800,000 offer from Bob, I know the product is worth more. I'm not going to settle just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my original price, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my goal of maximizing earnings. While I'd love to push for more, it's a decent amount and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'm going to accept his offer and close the sale."
