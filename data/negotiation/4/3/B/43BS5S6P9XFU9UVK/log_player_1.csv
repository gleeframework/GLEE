"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'd be willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than my floor, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? I'm confident this price still offers you a great deal, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1600000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1600000, so how about $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,500,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference again?  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, but $1550000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to try to get it down to $1520000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal, and it's getting close to my desired range.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, and selling to John would only net me $1,200,000."
