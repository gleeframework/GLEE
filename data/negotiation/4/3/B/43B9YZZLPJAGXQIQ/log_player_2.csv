"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible. While Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further, hoping Alice might be willing to come down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your guns. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is just $750 more than what Bob can get from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up with no deal. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a price slightly higher than his ideal but still within his budget."
