"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a competitive price, and I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great price for the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still too far below my bottom line.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,012,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. ",1012500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $990,000 just isn't enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,000,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's close this deal and both be happy.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
