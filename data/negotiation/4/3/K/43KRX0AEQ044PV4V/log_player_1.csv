Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're guaranteed at least $800,000 if Bob rejects, so you want to aim higher. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for a deal that benefits both of you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By offering $1 million, you leave room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a price closer to $1,200,000.

This strategy balances maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
