"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the exclusivity of this product, $20000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $18000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. While I see the value in the product, $18000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the exclusivity you'll be getting. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $15000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,6,
