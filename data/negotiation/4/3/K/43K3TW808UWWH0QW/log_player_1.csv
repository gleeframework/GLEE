Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information you've provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but you have a good buffer before reaching your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasize the product's unique value and benefits to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Create Urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, implying this is a limited-time offer might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to avoid turning him off completely.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly lower price might be strategically beneficial.
