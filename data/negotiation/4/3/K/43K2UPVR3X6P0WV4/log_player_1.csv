{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $175 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, giving me some room to negotiate, but it's also lower than my minimum of $150, leaving some potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. This is important to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Strategy:** By starting with a slightly higher price, I am setting the stage for a negotiation. I am also keeping the option open to switch to John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's above his initial value of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum of $150. 
* **I want to counteroffer.** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price.  
* **John is a backup option.**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm not desperate and have a guaranteed buyer in John.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product. This should encourage Bob to reconsider and potentially come closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a good value for you, considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $160, which is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but it also keeps the price above my minimum.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal, but I also reiterate the product's value.  This helps to maintain a positive tone and encourages Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Strategy:**  By showing a willingness to move, I'm hoping to signal to Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm not desperate. This should incentivize him to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $160, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** Even though it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150. 
* **I want to counteroffer one more time.** I believe I can push for a slightly higher price.
* **John is still a backup option.** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, but I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm indicating that I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low. This will keep the pressure on Bob to come up with a more acceptable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $140 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $145, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer. It's a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still above my minimum.
* **Pressure:** The message emphasizes that this is my final offer and that I have another buyer lined up. This creates a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I frame the offer as a compromise, acknowledging that I've lowered my price to meet him halfway.

**Strategy:**

This final counteroffer aims to:

* Push Bob closer to my desired price.
* Signal that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not desperate.
* Create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept before I move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum of $150.  
* **John is a guaranteed sale.** I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is not worth the potential loss in profit. 
* **Time is a factor.** This negotiation has taken several rounds, and it's time to make a decision.

Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired price and avoids further rounds of negotiation with Bob that might not yield a better result."
