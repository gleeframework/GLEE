"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum, you want to try and get a better price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to bargain.

By rejecting the offer, you open the door for a counteroffer, potentially saving yourself some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives you a good value and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:** $130 is a good price for you, considering your maximum is $150. 
* **Saving money:**  You've already negotiated down from $140, so you're getting a decent discount.
* **Limited rounds:** You have fewer rounds left, and further negotiation might risk the deal falling through. 

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price, within your budget, without the risk of losing it to John."
