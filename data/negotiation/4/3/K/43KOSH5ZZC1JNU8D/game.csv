"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it would be highly valuable to your business. My initial offer is $900,000.  This price reflects the product's true worth and potential for growth. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to compromise. I propose a price of $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $740,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my minimum price. This reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",740000.0,Alice,5,
