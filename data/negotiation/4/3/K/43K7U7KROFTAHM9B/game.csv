"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still gives you a great deal. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still not a price I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're willing to close the deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,400.  This is my final offer - if you're not willing to go this high, I'll have to sell to another buyer.",9400.0,Alice,7,
