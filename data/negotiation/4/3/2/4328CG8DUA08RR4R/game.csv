"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
