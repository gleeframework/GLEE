"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John. Alice is offering it for $120, which is a better price, but you can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or potentially find another seller with a better deal."
