I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while also reflecting the product's significant value to me. I'm hoping Bob will see the potential in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try and get a better deal.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a bit higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility I can reach a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob is not willing to budge much and the price is getting too low.  I am going to sell to John and guarantee myself a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
