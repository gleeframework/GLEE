"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value to you, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start by discussing a fair price. Considering the product's worth to both of us, how about we aim for a price between $12000 and $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit high considering the product's worth to Alice is only $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 10000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I think the product is worth more to me than to Alice, I'm willing to pay a higher price than the product's worth to Alice. However, I'd like to stay within my budget of $15,000.

{""message"": ""I'm excited about the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
