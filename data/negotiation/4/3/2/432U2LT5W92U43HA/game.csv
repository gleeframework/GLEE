"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $160 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a deal a bit closer to $130. Would that be possible?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I can offer you a compromise at $155. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for a high-quality product like this. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm ready to close this deal. How about we meet in the middle at $142.50?",142.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can make it work.",145.0,Alice,7,
