"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $120 for it. This is a special offer tailored to your needs and I'm confident it will provide you with excellent returns on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your maximum price:** $150
* **Alice's offer:** $120
* **John's price:** $150

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price, but you can get the product for the same price from John, you should reject Alice's offer. This opens the possibility for Alice to lower her price further to get a deal."
