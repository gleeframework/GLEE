"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob. Alice's offer is too high.  Bob should reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum of $15,000 as possible, but needs to start low to leave room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and establishes Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down significantly, her price is still higher than Bob's maximum. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum with this offer.  It's still lower than Alice's price, but shows he's willing to be flexible.  This gives him a chance to see if Alice will come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's getting close to his maximum.  It's safer to buy from John for $15,000 and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers."
