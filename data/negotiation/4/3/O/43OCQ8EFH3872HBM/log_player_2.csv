"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can save even more money by rejecting her offer. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, but there's a chance you could negotiate a lower price with him since you're no longer under pressure to buy from Alice."
