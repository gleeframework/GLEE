"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value, I'm asking for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential for you. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it right now. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825000? This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm eager to close this deal.  $825000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $800000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've outlined.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
