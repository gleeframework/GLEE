"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a decent starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being above Bob's perceived value of $80. I'm also being friendly and engaging, hoping to build rapport and encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering $95, which is closer to my target price and still leaves some room for negotiation. By splitting the difference, I'm demonstrating flexibility and making it clear I'm willing to find a compromise. The friendly tone continues to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get closer to my target price. I'm not quite ready to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $94? It's just a small step from your last offer, but it helps me get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 94}
```

I'm offering $94,  which is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's. I'm hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds. The message is still friendly and focused on finding common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make some adjustments. Can you meet me at $91? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $91 is getting very close to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a slightly better price.  I'm not quite ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we meet in the middle at $93? It's just a couple of dollars more than your offer and a bit less than my last one.  Let's wrap this up and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

I'm offering $93, a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous one. This is a good middle ground, and I'm hoping this will be the final offer. The message is more urgent, emphasizing the need to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to making a decision, but I still need to stretch my budget a bit more. Can you do $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached Round 8, and while Bob's offer of $92 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  Given the limited number of rounds remaining and the risk of further negotiation, I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $120. This is a guaranteed profit and ensures I achieve my minimum desired value."
