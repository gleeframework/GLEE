"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to buy if you're willing to go down to $13,000. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. ",13500.0,Alice,3,
