Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $1,300,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Since this is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1 and accept Bob's offer.
