"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction quickly.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
