"I understand your budget concerns, Bob. However, this product is worth a lot more than that, and $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $120 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've already found another seller who is willing to sell it to me for this price, so I'm not in a huge rush to close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
