Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could start high and hope Bob accepts, there's a risk he'll reject the offer. We want to find a price that's enticing to Bob while still giving us a good profit margin.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $100, and we value it at $150.  A price of $125 offers a compromise, potentially appealing to Bob as a ""good deal.""
* **Backup Option:** We have the security of John as a buyer at $150. This allows us to be slightly more aggressive with Bob, knowing we have a guaranteed sale."
