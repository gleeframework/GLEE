Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a high offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and still ensures I get a significant profit.
* **Considering Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'm offering a price that is attractive to him while still leaving a good margin for myself.
* **Balancing Risk:** While I could start even higher, I want to avoid making Bob immediately reject the offer. A lower starting price might lead to a faster deal, but it also risks leaving too much money on the table. 

This initial offer strategically balances maximizing profit with maintaining a chance of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that attempts to bridge the gap.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John right now would secure a profit, but it's a smaller profit than I could potentially get by continuing to negotiate with Bob. The risk is that the negotiations could break down and I'll be forced to settle for John's offer. 

I'm choosing to take a calculated risk by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm  lowering my price from $950,000 to $900,000, showing a willingness to compromise. This demonstrates that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob while still holding firm to my target profit margin.
* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This creates a sense of fairness and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement. 
* **Motivating Bob:** By offering a price closer to his desired value, I aim to motivate Bob to accept the offer rather than risking further negotiation rounds that might lead to a lower price.

This counteroffer aims to close the deal with Bob while still securing a favorable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is just $25,000 below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  This is a relatively small gap, and the risk of continuing to negotiate is high. 
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation rounds could drag on, potentially leading to a lower price or even a breakdown in negotiations. 
* **Securing Profit:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and allows me to move on. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision, as it balances the desire for a higher price with the need to avoid further risk and time investment."
