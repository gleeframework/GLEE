"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, you can potentially do better.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $110, which is still within my budget and a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer.  It leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating my interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $118 is close to my maximum price of $120.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up buying from John at $120.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a decent price within my budget."
