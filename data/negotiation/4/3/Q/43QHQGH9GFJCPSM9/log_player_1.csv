Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher gives room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth above $800,000.
* **Safety net:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still being realistic about the possibility of negotiation or Bob rejecting the offer."
