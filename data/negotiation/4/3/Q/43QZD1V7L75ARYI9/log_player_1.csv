Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, offering it for $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing you a higher profit than John's offer.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
