"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love!  I'm initially asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price.  There's no downside to rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $140, which is still within my budget and a good deal. Accepting this offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee I can get a lower price in another round of negotiations."
