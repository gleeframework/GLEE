"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's $10,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further. There's room for Alice to come down to a price closer to her $8,000 value, and Bob has the leverage of being able to walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm looking to get a better deal. Considering the product's value to me and your own cost, I'd like to offer $8,500. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to me and the negotiations so far, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's still better than John's offer of $10,000 and only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There's not much more room for negotiation, and further rounds might not yield a significantly better price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation that could result in a higher price or a stalemate."
