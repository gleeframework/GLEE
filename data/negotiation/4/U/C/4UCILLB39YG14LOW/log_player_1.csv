Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value.  I believe Bob will find this price attractive, as it's still below his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $16,500. This price is still above my minimum value, but it represents a compromise. I believe that Bob will find this price to be more acceptable, and we can potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to reach an agreement with Bob, I don't want to compromise my own value of the product.  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum value."
