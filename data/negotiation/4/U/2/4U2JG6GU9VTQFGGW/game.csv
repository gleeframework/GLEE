"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $1,150,000 falls a bit short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to consider $1,225,000 - it's a firm offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
