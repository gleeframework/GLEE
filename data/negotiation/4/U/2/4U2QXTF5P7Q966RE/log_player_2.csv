"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd really find it valuable.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $150 is above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $110 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. While it's closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  How about we settle on $115? That's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 115}
