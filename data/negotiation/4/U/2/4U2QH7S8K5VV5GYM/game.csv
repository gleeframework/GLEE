"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500?  That would be a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Would you be willing to do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $11,500? This is a final compromise from my side. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,5,
