"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a more reasonable price. How does $1500000 sound to you?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to compromise, but how about we split the difference?  I'll accept $1125000.  Let's make this happen.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1125000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $937500?",937500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm open to negotiating, $937500 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This is a significant drop from my original price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your position, but $950000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $975000. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
