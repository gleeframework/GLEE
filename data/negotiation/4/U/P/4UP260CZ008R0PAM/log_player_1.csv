"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $13,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm countering with $16,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal without having to sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $15,500.  It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still above my minimum and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal."
