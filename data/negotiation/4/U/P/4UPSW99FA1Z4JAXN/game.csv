"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. $10000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11000?  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
