Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get a good deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum of $800,000. I also have John as a backup, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good price.  It's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, so hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired price, and it's higher than what John is offering.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal.  There's always a risk that we could continue negotiating and end up with a lower offer, or even that Bob could back out.  $920,000 is a good price, and it's time to secure the sale."
