"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a starting price of $22,000. I believe it holds significant value, even beyond its price, and would be a valuable asset to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $22,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less.  The next step is to make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know if that's a possibility for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle; how about $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $18,000 is better than $22,000, it's still above his budget.  He should counteroffer again and try to get closer to his target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your seriousness about this purchase.  While $10,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $14,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the same product from John for $8,000. Bob should counteroffer again to see if he can get Alice to lower her price further."
