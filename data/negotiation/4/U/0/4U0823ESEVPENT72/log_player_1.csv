Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It is higher than what John is offering, giving me a better chance of getting a higher price. It also gives Bob room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can push for a better deal. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.  This counteroffer gives Bob a bit more room to negotiate while remaining above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price before I risk selling to John."

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. This shows flexibility, but still leaves a little room for negotiation, allowing for a possible deal before selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, the risk of further negotiations falling through is too high. Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds."
