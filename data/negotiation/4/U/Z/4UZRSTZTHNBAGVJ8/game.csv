"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement on this.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $825,001. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825001.0,Alice,5,
