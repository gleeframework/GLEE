"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. That said, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle again at $775,000 and call it a deal?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
