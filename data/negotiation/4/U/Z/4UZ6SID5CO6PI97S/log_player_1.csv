Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a slightly higher price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $149 is just below my guaranteed sale price, creating a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested."
