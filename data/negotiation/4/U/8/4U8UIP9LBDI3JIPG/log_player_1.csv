Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:**  Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) and closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leaving room for Bob to counter-offer:** By not starting at your absolute minimum, you give Bob the opportunity to counter-offer. This opens the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price that is still profitable for you. 
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and potentially justify the price in his mind.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you're not losing out completely if Bob declines."
