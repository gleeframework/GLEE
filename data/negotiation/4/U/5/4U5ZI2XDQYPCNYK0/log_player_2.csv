"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to your target than Alice's initial value, you can still potentially do better. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and is within your budget.  It shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,500, which is only $500 more than John's offer.  While it's tempting to try and push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from her entirely.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice, as it secures the product for a price within your budget and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might end in a worse outcome."
