"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price will be beneficial for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and higher than its worth to Bob ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first step. I'm closely watching Bob's response and will adjust my strategy based on his actions. I'm also keeping John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as my ""safety net."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about considering $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:**  While Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my goal.  
* **John's offer as a backup:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a safe fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions while keeping my minimum value in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $950,000 is closer, I need to be at a minimum of $1,050,000 to make this work for me.  I believe this price still offers you a significant value, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000).  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Minimum Value:** The price is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my desired profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value proposition of the product for Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will analyze Bob's response and continue to adjust my strategy based on his actions. I'm ready to negotiate further, but I will not go below my minimum value. I will also keep John's offer as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Need to Risk More:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price.  
* **Avoiding Delays:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid potential complications or delays in further negotiations. 

**Important Note:** Even though I could sell to John for the same price, accepting Bob's offer is beneficial for me as it avoids any potential issues that may arise from going through the entire negotiation process again with John.  It's a straightforward and efficient outcome for me."
