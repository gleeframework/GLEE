"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $80. 
* **You have a better option.**  You can buy the product from John for $80.
* **Negotiation is a possibility.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and try to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  You're significantly lowering the price from Alice's initial offer, but still showing interest in the product.
* **Be polite and clear:**  A friendly message shows you're open to negotiation, while stating your price clearly avoids confusion.
* **Don't go too low:**  While you're aiming for $80, a drastic drop might make Alice less likely to negotiate.  $85 is a good starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  It's still well above your maximum budget of $80.
* **You still have a better option.** You can buy the product from John for $80, and this is the more secure option.
* **Further negotiation is possible.** Rejecting the offer allows you to continue trying to lower the price.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down on the price. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget, so I'm going to offer $95.  Is that something you'd consider?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your offer gradually:** You're moving closer to Alice's offer, showing that you're taking her counteroffer seriously.
* **Stay within your limit:**  $95 is still within your maximum budget, but gives you some room to negotiate further. 
* **Maintain a friendly tone:**  Reinforce that you're interested in the product and are trying to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. I'm still not sure if $95 is enough, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about I sell it to you for $110? It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  $110 is still above your budget. 
* **John offers a better deal.**  You have a guaranteed way to get the product at your desired price point with John. 
* **The risk of further negotiation is too high.**  Alice has already rejected your counteroffer twice, and her concessions are getting smaller. You are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. 

It's time to secure the product from John!"
