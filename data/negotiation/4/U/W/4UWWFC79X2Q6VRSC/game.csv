"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. I'm still not sure if $95 is enough, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about I sell it to you for $110? It's the best I can do.",110.0,Alice,5,
