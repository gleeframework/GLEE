"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it's of significant value to you. How does $140 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **Your Value:** $150
* **Alice's Value:** $120

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum value ($150), accepting the offer is the best option. This allows you to save $10 compared to buying from John."
