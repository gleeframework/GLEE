"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $1250000. This is a significant discount from its true potential value. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
