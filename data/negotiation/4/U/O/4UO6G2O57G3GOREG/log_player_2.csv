"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,100,000)** is better than buying from John ($1,200,000). 
* You save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* Although Alice is making a profit of $300,000, your goal is to get the best deal for yourself, not necessarily to maximize Alice's loss."
