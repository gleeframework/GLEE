"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $17,000. This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, I still can't meet the price of $17,000. I'd like to propose $9,000 as a counteroffer, hoping we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'd like to propose $14,000 as a counteroffer. It's a bit higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
