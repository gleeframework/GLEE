"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This gives you a substantial discount while still ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's find common ground and make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product to both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  This would be a significant gain for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal and move forward.",825000.0,Alice,5,
