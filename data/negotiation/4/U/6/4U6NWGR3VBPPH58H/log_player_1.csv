"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best chance to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'll counter with a lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept while still getting a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I could try to squeeze a bit more, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and potentially ending up with the $1,000,000 from John is too high. I'm going to accept the offer and secure a good profit."
