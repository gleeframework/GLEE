"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the time and effort I've invested in it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1250000, which is a significant amount for me and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to a final agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1250000 is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1280000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my original asking price.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
