Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm starting the price at $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for something of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your ideal selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if the price comes down. 
* **Projecting Value:**  By starting high, Alice reinforces the idea that the product is valuable, potentially even more valuable than Bob initially perceived. 
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has the security of John's offer, giving her leverage. She doesn't have to desperately negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still less than what John is offering.  Alice has room to negotiate further and try to close the gap between Bob's offer and her minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your valuation, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a higher price. Would you consider $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice is moving closer to Bob's price range, showing flexibility, but not drastically. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""inherent worth and potential,"" Alice reiterates its value, hoping to nudge Bob closer to her desired price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps Alice in a strong position. It's significantly more than Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant profit over John's standing offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether. There's no guarantee he'll go higher, and Alice could miss out on both offers.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means Alice gets her money sooner, which is always advantageous in business."
