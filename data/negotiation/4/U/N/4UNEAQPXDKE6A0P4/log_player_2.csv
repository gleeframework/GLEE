"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your needs. This exceptional item comes with a host of features that we believe will greatly benefit you. Given its quality and the value it offers, I am extending an initial offer of $12000 for the product. I look forward to your response and hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice's initial offer is also $12,000, there is no benefit in negotiating further. Buying from John at the same price guarantees the purchase and avoids the uncertainty of negotiation."
