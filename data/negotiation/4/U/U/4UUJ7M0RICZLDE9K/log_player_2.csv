"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and Alice is asking for $14,000.
* **You have room to negotiate.** There's a potential for Alice to lower her price, as she values the product at $12,000.
* **Buying from John is a safety net.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still buy the product from John for $15,000. 

**Next steps:** You will need to make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, as it's lower than Alice's offer but still higher than her minimum price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation, as there's still a gap between your offer and Alice's desired price.
* **Maintaining interest:** The message expresses interest in the product, but emphasizes the need for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and Alice is now offering $13,500.
* **It's a reasonable compromise.** Alice has lowered her price, and you've already made a counteroffer. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially get you a lower price, but it also risks Alice becoming less willing to sell or you losing the opportunity to buy from her. 

**This offer presents a good compromise where you get a fair price while also avoiding the risk of losing the opportunity or having to buy from John at a higher price.**"
