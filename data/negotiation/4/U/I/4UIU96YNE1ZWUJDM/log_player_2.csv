"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $140 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards my $150 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($105) than Alice's opening ($140). This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and friendly tone is important for a good negotiation.
* **Justification:** While I didn't explicitly justify the lower price, it's implied that I'm looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $125 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($125) and my previous counteroffer ($105). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm stating my desired price directly without too much fluff.
* **Still Room to Negotiate:** I'm leaving a little wiggle room in case Alice is completely unwilling to go below $120."
