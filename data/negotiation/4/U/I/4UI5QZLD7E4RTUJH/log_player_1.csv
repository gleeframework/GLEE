Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price ($10,000) sets a strong anchor. While it's higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might decline even if the offer is at his maximum perceived value. By starting high, you maximize your potential gain if Bob is willing to pay your full asking price."
