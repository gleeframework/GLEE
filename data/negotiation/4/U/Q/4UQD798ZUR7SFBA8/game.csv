"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. While I see the value in this product, $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to offer $8500 for it. This is my best offer, as I've already been quoted $8000 elsewhere.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $9500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can get it for $8000 elsewhere. I'm willing to offer $9000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm willing to meet you at $9200. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to let it go at this price. Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,5,
