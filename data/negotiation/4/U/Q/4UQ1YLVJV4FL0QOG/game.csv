"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $140 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $125 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a profit.",125.0,Bob,2,
