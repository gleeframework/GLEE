"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9500. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8500 for the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $8800? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $8900, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,
