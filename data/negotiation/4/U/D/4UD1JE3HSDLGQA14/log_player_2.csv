"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000, which is a significant discount given its true worth.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $1,000,000.  Please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:** Her statement about another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 is likely a tactic to pressure you. It's improbable she'd offer a discount below her product's value if she had a guaranteed buyer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting the offer, you signal that the price is too high. Alice might come back with a lower offer closer to her $1,000,000 valuation.
* **John as backup:** You have John as a safety net. While his price is higher, it ensures you won't be left without the product if negotiations with Alice fail."
