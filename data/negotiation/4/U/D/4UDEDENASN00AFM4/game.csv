"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering I could get it from John for $10,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the fact that you could get it for $10,000 from John. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my ability to get it for $10,000 from John. Let's meet halfway!",10750.0,Bob,4,
