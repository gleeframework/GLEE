Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is $200,000 less than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also ensures I get significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident Bob will find this offer appealing, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can secure a higher price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price of $1,350,000.  This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, while still ensuring a profit for me. I'm confident this offer will be attractive to Bob, and I'm hoping to close the deal in this round."
