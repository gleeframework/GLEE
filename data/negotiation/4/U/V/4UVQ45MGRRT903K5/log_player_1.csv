Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum desired amount of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it meets my minimum desired price, it's still far lower than my initial asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation and I can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good amount for me, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.  I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm also prepared to go back and forth a few more times to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go much lower than my minimum desired price. John is offering me my minimum, and I'd rather secure that than continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a worse deal."
