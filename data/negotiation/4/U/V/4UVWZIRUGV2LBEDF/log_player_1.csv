Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,200,000? This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  I have a safety net with John's offer, so I'm not desperate to close immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
