"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,200,000? This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could continue negotiating, $1,300,000 is a good price that's within his budget and significantly lower than John's price. There's a risk that Alice might not come down further, and he could end up paying more or buying from John at a higher price."
