{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm willing to accept $8,000 from John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $7500 for the product.  This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair one given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $8250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is only $250 below my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's a decent compromise and secures a sale. Selling to John would only yield $8,000, so accepting Bob's offer is the better option."
