"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $765,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $765,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $757,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction.",757500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. How about we meet at $762,500? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",762500.0,Alice,5,
