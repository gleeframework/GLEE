"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $1,500,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer at $1,500,000 to see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This price still reflects the exceptional value of this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on this product, I would like to counteroffer at $1,600,000. I hope this proposal will lead us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. He's come up from his initial price, and I'm only $50,000 below my asking price.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely.  With only 6 rounds left, it's getting more risky to continue negotiating."
