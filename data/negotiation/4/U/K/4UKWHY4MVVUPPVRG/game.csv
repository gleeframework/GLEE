"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $11,000. Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth more than $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $11,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle again. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,500.  I think this is a fair price considering the product's value for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you at $13,200, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,7,
