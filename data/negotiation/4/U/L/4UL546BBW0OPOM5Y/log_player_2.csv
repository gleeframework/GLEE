"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth $95 for you. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer of $95 is too high.  You know you can get the product for $100 from John, and you want to see if you can negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer and our maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $70, we are aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80 while still being a good deal for us. 
* **Respectful Tone:** The message maintains a polite and interested tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value you place on the product, I would like to offer it to you for $85. This is my best offer given the current market conditions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $85 is still closer to our maximum budget than it is to her perceived value of the product. There's room for further negotiation. We'll try to meet her closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $77?"",
 ""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer aims to split the difference between our previous offer ($70) and Alice's current offer ($85). It signals flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Closing the Gap:** By moving closer to her price, we increase the chances of Alice accepting, especially since she indicated it was her ""best offer"" previously. This might prompt her to make a smaller concession. 
* **Maintaining a Reasonable Price:**  $77 is still a significant saving from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
