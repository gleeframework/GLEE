,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $105.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",105.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $108 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm happy to pay $102, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!",102.0,Bob,6,
