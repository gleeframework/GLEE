"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the price down a bit. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know your thoughts on this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, while still offering a price that's above her minimum value. This shows Bob is serious about purchasing the product but is also trying to secure a good deal.  The message is friendly and encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1050000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still allows for a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still above her minimum value.  It's also closer to Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a potential meeting point.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's, saving him a considerable amount of money."
