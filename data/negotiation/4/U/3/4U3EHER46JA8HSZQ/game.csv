"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specific details right now, I can assure you that this product is worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This represents a significant potential upside for you, as you may find its value even higher. Please consider this offer carefully. If you choose not to proceed, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1200000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
