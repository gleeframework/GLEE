"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specific details right now, I can assure you that this product is worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This represents a significant potential upside for you, as you may find its value even higher. Please consider this offer carefully. If you choose not to proceed, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000. Even though she claims the product is worth more to her, that's irrelevant to your goal of maximizing your savings. You can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
