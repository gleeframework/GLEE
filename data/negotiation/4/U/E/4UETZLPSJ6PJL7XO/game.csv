"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential impact.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true market value. I'm confident this product can generate substantial returns for your business, which is why I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects my strong belief in its worth and offers a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part and is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, I need to be upfront â€“ the $950,000 offer is still considerably lower than what I can accept.  This product is in high demand and I have other interested buyers.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the immense value this product brings.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
