Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, I need to be upfront â€“ the $950,000 offer is still considerably lower than what I can accept.  This product is in high demand and I have other interested buyers.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the immense value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above your budget.  You've made several counteroffers and she's shown a willingness to negotiate, but it seems she's not willing to come down to a price you can afford. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
