{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $100 is too low for me, and I still have a chance to get a better deal with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to negotiate, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While $110 isn't my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $100, and it's also a fair compromise with Bob.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn."
