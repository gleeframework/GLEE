"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  There's room for negotiation as Alice is willing to sell for $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11000? It's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  While he might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and having to buy from John at $15,000 is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures a good deal for Bob."
