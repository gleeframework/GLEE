"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $16,000 to make it worth my while. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering $16,000, and now you're asking me to go down to $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,000, which is $15,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
