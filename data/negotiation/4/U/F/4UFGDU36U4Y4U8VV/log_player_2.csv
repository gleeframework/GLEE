"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product from John for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $16,000 to make it worth my while. How about $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her first offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product from John for less, and he still has some room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering $16,000, and now you're asking me to go down to $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,000, which is $15,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is now offering $15,000, which is still above Bob's budget. John is offering a price that is within Bob's budget and there is no guarantee that Alice will lower her price any further."
