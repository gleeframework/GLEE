"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer. There's no benefit to accepting it at this point. By rejecting, you open up the possibility of negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount. This demonstrates my seriousness in negotiating while still leaving room for compromise.  It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to show Alice that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still not as low as I'd like. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a price closer to my ideal $1,100,000.  Rejecting the offer gives me another opportunity to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a good deal.  I'm aiming to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous offer. This approach shows a willingness to negotiate, but not at the expense of my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now just $75,000 above my ideal price point.  While I'd prefer to get it for $1,100,000, it's getting increasingly likely that we won't be able to close the gap further.  Given that I'm running out of rounds and John is offering the product for $1,200,000, it makes sense to accept this offer and secure the product."
