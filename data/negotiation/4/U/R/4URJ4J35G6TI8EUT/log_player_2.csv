"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is still within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's starting with a significant counteroffer, far lower than Alice's initial price. This aggressive stance aims to establish a lower negotiation range. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's a gamble, but rejecting this offer keeps the door open to potentially reaching a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's moved up from his previous counteroffer, showing he's willing to compromise.  $750,000 is still a significant saving compared to Alice's offer and is closer to what Bob is willing to pay. This counteroffer increases the chances of reaching an agreement while still maintaining some negotiating leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $820,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price. However, Bob has been successful in pushing the price lower in each round. There's still a chance to get a better deal. 

Bob is only $20,000 away from his target price from John. He can afford to take a few more rounds and try to push the price lower.  If he fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now within reach of his target price.  He's offering Alice's bottom line, making it clear he's willing to buy at that price.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and close the deal or risk losing the sale. If Alice rejects, Bob can move on to John without any further negotiation."
