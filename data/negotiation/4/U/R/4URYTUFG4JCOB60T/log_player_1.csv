Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to my price, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too significant. It's time to move on and secure the $1,200,000."
