"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
