,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for both of us to make a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price recognizes the value of the product for you and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's work towards an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This offer is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,450,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal before we run out of time.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate you reaching $1,400,000.  We're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Given the time constraint, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,475,000. This offer is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
