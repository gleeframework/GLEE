"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price is fair considering the market value and my current budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the market price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,090,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
