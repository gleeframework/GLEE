"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $11,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still a bit short on the price. I can do $12,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",12500.0,Alice,5,
