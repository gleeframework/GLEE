Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that it's worth a significant amount. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" signals that you're open to discussing the price. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $8,000, it's ideal to maximize your profit with Bob if possible."
