Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  $1,400,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also recognizes that the product is worth more to Bob.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and direct, stating the price and inviting Bob to respond. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is intended to gauge Bob's interest while leaving myself room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob counteroffers, but if the negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I'm ready to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1300000? I believe that's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with my own.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hopefully closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000.  I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to concede while still remaining profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I'm offering $1,350,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm, reiterating my position and highlighting the value to Bob. It also uses language like ""fair price"" and ""both of us to be happy"" to frame the negotiation as a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance:

* **Pushing for a higher price:** I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer just yet.
* **Showing flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I haven't given up entirely, and I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
