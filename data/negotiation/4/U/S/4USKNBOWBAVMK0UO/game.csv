"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite align with my valuation of the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and still provides you with a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
