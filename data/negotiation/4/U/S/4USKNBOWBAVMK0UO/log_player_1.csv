Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob's offer:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $1,000,000 minimum without several more rounds of negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which aligns with my needs. It's time to move on to ensure a profitable deal."
