"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $16000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $15500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
