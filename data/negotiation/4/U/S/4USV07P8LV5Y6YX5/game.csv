"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. Could we discuss a price closer to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, while also allowing me to earn a decent profit.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your effort to find a fair price. I would like to suggest $160 as a potential price for the product. This allows us to stay within my budget while still providing you with a reasonable profit.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial price. How about we meet at $165? It's a small increase from your offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I believe $160 was a fair price considering the value of the product. Unfortunately, I cannot agree to $165. Could we possibly meet at $162? This would still allow you to earn a reasonable profit while staying within my budget.",162.0,Bob,6,
