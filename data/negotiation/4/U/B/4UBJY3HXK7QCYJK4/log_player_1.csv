Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer price of $1,150,000 is carefully chosen:
    * **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly lower than the product's worth to him ($1,000,000).
    * **Profitable for Alice:**  It's still a $150,000 profit over the guaranteed sale.
* **Urgency & Exclusivity:**  The message implies a time limit and exclusivity, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while balancing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
