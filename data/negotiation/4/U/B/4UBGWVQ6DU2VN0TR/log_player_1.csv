Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is set at $16,000, it implies the product's high value. Bob might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as highly beneficial. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can negotiate down or proceed with John, ensuring you don't sell below your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how price-sensitive Bob is or how much he values the product beyond $12,000.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
