"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I need to be realistic about the product's value. How about we split the difference again and settle at $850,000? This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's make this happen.",750000.0,Bob,6,
