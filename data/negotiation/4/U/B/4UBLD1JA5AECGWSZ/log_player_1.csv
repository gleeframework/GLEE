Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 6

It's time to cut bait with Bob. He's consistently been significantly below my minimum, and while he's inching up, the progress is too slow.  It's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
