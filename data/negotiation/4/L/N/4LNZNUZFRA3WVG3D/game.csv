"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to proceed.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9200. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8700 for the product.  This shows my genuine interest, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $9000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll give you a discount of $100, so the new price would be $8900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",8900.0,Alice,5,
