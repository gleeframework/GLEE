"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential in this product, $2,250,000 is significantly beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum value and the fact that I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a step in the right direction, I have room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price, especially since I have the backup option of John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is appealing, the product's value remains higher than that. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Targeting Above Midpoint:** This counteroffer is closer to my target but still significantly above Bob's initial offer. It keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Maintaining Value Proposition:** I've reiterated the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and also happens to be the same amount John is offering. While I could potentially push for a bit more, accepting now guarantees I meet my goal without further risk or delay."
