"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Could you consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I also need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can do better than $850,000. My counteroffer is $950,000 for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more affordable. Would you consider $900,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go down to $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
