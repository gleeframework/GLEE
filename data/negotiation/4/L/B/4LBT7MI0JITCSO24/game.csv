"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're willing to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",8250.0,Bob,4,
