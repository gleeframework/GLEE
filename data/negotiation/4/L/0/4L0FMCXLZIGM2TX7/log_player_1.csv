{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with."", ""product_price"": 10750}

``` 

This is a tough call, as we are running out of rounds.  While I would prefer more, Bob's offer of $10,300 is closer to my ideal price than John's offer of $10,000. I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the deal."
