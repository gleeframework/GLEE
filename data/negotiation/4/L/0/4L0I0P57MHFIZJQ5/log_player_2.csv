{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $12,000. It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 
 
I'm offering Alice $9,000. This is a significant discount from her asking price, but still a reasonable amount since the product is worth $10,000 to me.  Let's see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's most recent offer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to her, while still saving me some money."
