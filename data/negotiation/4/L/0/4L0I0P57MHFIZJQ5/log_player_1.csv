"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a slight concession by lowering the price to $10,500. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum price point, and we are already in round 4. There's a risk that I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and John is always a sure $10,000.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure the sale."
