"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $125?  I'm really interested in the product and think we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit to $135.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
