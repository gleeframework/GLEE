"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $9,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
