Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. $950,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

Alice is firm on her price and unlikely to budge from $1,100,000.  Since John offers the product for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to go with John at this point."
