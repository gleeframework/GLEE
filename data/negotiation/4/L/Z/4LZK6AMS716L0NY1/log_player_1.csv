Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $100, so $175 gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're not willing to sell for less than $150, so this offer is still within your acceptable range.
* **It's a strong first offer:** It shows that you're confident in your product's worth and are willing to negotiate fairly. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum price of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $140 to make this worthwhile. How about $145?  This is a great price considering the value you'll get. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You're not sticking to your initial price, but you're still holding firm to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Offers a fair middle ground:** $145 is a decent compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Reinforces the value proposition:** You're reminding Bob of the product's worth, justifying the slightly higher price. 

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $130? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to your minimum, it's still below it.  It's not worth risking a continued negotiation with Bob when you have a guaranteed sale to John for $150.  It's time to move on to the more reliable deal."
