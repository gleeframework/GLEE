"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $95. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to be fair. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $105.  This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
