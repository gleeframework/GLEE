Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** You need to get at least $1,200,000 for the product to make it worthwhile.
* **Potential Upward Value:** You're hoping Bob values the product higher than that, so you're offering a price that's significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward of earning an extra $300,000 is worth the risk. 

This strategy attempts to maximize your potential earnings while still ensuring you get a good price for the product."
