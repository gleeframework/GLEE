Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $14,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think it's a fair compromise. Can you consider this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $13,000.  She's made it clear that's her bottom line. While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to $13,000 and you losing the opportunity to buy from John for $12,000."
