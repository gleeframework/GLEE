"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. However, I am still looking to keep the price at or below $8,000. Could we possibly come to an agreement at $8,000?

Bob is clearly anchored at $8,000 and doesn't seem willing to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
