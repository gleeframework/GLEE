Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, offering him the product at $15,000 ensures that I get the maximum possible value for it.  If he rejects the offer, I can sell it to John for the same price, so there's no risk in offering him the maximum value."
