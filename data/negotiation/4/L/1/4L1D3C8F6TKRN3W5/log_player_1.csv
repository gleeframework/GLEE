Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but it's also below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, while still leaving a good profit margin for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is a decent price, it's still lower than your initial offer. There's a chance you can get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still being close to your desired price point. It signals that you are willing to negotiate but also that you value your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer, and there's no guarantee that he'll budge further. It's best to accept the offer and secure a sale for a price that's within your acceptable range."
