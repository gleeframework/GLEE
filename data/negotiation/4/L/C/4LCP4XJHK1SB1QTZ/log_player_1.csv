"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it! I'm asking for $110, which I believe is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100).  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. I'm also being friendly and hoping to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 seems a bit high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than my minimum acceptable price, and it's much lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm reducing my price from $110 to $90, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm trying to find a middle ground that is fair to both of us. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to see if I can sway him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob.  There's a chance I can get a better price from him, and I'm still early in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still not able to go that low. How about $85? I think that's a fair price considering what the product is worth to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm reducing my price again to $85, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm hoping to close the deal at this point, as we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm also being enthusiastic to encourage Bob to accept."
