Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I'd sell to John, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm open to negotiation and willing to lower the price slightly if Bob seems interested but can't meet my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
