"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. I know it's worth that much to you, and I believe it's a fair price. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to you. You know you can get it for $12,000 from John. By rejecting her offer, you force her hand. She'll likely either lower the price or sell it to John."
