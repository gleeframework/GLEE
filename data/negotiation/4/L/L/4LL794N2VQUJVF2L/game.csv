"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $132.50.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about $115?  That's closer to my budget and would be a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob. I can do $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
