"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $10,750. I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
