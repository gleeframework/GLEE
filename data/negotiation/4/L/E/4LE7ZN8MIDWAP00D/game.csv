"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I think it's a steal at this price, considering what you'll gain from it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This reflects the value it brings while still being a reasonable deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, but $14,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
