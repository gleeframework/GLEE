Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since Bob values the product at $120, starting higher gives room for negotiation or a quick sale at a great profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price higher than $120  allows Bob to counter-offer. This starts a dialogue and  potentially leads to a price higher than my minimum.
* **Strong Opening:** A confident opening offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 

**Important Note:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $120, there's always a chance to earn more. This strategy aims for that possibility."
