"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than the market average for similar products, and $900,000 undervalues its true potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.
