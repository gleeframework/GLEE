"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than the market average for similar products, and $900,000 undervalues its true potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market average. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
