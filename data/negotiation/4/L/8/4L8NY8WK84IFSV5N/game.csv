"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for this product. This is my final offer, as I have an alternative option for the same product at this price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't accept a price as low as $1,500,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,700,000. This represents a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. ",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation. It seems we're getting closer. While $1,700,000 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept $1,800,000 as a final offer. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal and reflects the product's inherent value.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to close the deal, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm only able to go up to $1,750,000. This is a significant amount for me, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're willing to accept this compromise.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
