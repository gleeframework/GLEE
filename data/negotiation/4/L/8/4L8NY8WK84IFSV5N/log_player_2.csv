# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't accept a price as low as $1,500,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You can try to meet her halfway, or suggest another compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation. It seems we're getting closer. While $1,700,000 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept $1,800,000 as a final offer. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal and reflects the product's inherent value.

Alice's final offer is still above your budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price, but you may need to be prepared to walk away. Since you can buy from John for your maximum price, it's worth trying to see if you can push Alice to come down a bit more."
