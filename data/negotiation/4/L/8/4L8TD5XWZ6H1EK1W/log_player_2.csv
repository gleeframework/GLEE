"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's in my best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see its benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $12,000 is still significantly more than my budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial $8,000 offer but not that high."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than my budget. While I could continue to negotiate, it's clear that reaching a price I'm comfortable with is going to be difficult. It's now in my best interest to buy the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
