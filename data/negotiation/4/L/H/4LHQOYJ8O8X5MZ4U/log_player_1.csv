Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlight value:**  I'm mentioning the product's value to make it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for a counteroffer from Bob, allowing the negotiation to flow naturally. 

I'm confident that this strategy will help me maximize my profit while still leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $8,000, and it's likely that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, potentially making me sell to John instead. Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit without risking a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a worse outcome."
