{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open for a potentially better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I believe the product is worth more, and I'm not desperate to sell immediately.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob has already shown interest and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my ideal value.
* **Strategic Advantage:**  By rejecting his offer, I put pressure on Bob to potentially increase his offer.  

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $15,000. This still reflects the significant value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a fair amount of profit.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Open Invitation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, encouraging Bob to make another counteroffer if necessary.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both of our needs and potentially leads to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my absolute minimum of $12,000. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a lower price or even no sale at all. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to Bob for $13,500 is a better outcome than selling to John for $12,000. 

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer secures a reasonable profit and ensures a sale.  I'm prioritizing a quick and profitable deal."
