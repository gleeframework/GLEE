Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000, which reflects the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and we're already at a point where selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and take the sure deal."
