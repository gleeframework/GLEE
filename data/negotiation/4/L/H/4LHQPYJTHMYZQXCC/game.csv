"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000, which reflects the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
