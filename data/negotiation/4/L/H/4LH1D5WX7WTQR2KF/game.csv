"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
