You can likely get a better price than $9,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $9,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You're still closer to your target price of $8,000. Rejecting again gives you a chance to make another counteroffer and potentially get even closer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,800 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,100. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

While you could potentially make another counteroffer, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  At this point, $9,100 is still a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.  Accepting the offer saves you $900."
