"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've placed on the product. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's true value while still providing you a significant deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000. How about we try $1,520,000? This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
