"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the high demand, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fairer compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a counteroffer of $14,500. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",14500.0,Bob,4,
