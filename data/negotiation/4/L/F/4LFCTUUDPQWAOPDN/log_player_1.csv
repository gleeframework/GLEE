"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to capture a good portion of the potential profit while also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a good deal, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$95 is still a little lower than what I want, but I'm getting closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again to try and get to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to a deal, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $92.50? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.5 is closer to my minimum price of $80, I'm still losing out on a considerable amount of profit. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to $95 or even $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but  $92.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $95? That's fair for both of us and would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking for a good deal, and I think $90 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are running out of time and Bob is not budging on his price.  While $90 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, it is not close to my desired target price. I've tried to negotiate and compromise, but I'm not getting a fair price from Bob.  Selling to John for $80 is the best option for me at this point."
