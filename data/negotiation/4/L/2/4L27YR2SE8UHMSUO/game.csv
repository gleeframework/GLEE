"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is still a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $900,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
