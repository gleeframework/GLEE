"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal considering its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Compromise:** Leaving space for negotiation allows for a more collaborative approach, potentially leading to a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**
* **I have 9 rounds left and can potentially get a better price.** 
* **Selling to John is an option, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.** 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer.
* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive and Open:**  The message remains positive and open to further negotiation, while also emphasizing my need to maintain a reasonable profit. 
* **Focus on Common Ground:**  I'm suggesting a middle ground to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,500,000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price.** This is a good outcome, considering my initial goal was to get at least $1,500,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  I've already had three rounds of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that continuing will lead to a better price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm happy to accept Bob's offer because it ensures the deal is closed and I avoid any potential complications with John. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this stage."
