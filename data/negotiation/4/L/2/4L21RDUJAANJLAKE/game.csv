"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,500,000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
