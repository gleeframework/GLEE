Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $16,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($16,000 vs. $12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my ideal outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest. If he's immediately turned off by the price, it suggests he might be a very price-sensitive buyer.  
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. This knowledge empowers me to be firm in negotiations with Bob. 

**Important Note:** I'm avoiding being overly aggressive in my initial offer.  While I want to maximize profit, I also want to increase the chances of a successful sale to Bob."
