Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leverage his potential desire for the product. I'll be ready to negotiate further if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,500? I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about $8,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with selling to John for $10,000, it's closer to my minimum desired price than Bob's offer of $8,700.  I'm confident I can find another buyer who is willing to pay closer to my desired price, but for now, I'll accept John's offer to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
