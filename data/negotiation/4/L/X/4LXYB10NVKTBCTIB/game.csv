"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, I believe it's worth more than what others have paid. However, I understand value perception varies. Considering its worth to me and the market, I propose a price of $95. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Looking forward to your response.",95.0,Alice,1,
