"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is quite a gap from where I see the value of this product.  To be frank, I wouldn't be comfortable going below $1,500,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. Are you open to finding a solution somewhere in this range? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$1,500,000 is still too high. Continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I understand your perspective on the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which reflects a significant increase from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the potential of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
