"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $115? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring I get a reasonable deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum, and I'm confident you'll still get a good deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
