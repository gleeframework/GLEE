"Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from its true worth. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can reach an even better agreement. How about I offer $1,100,000 for the product?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit and allow me to get closer to my desired price.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $1,110,000. This still leaves a good margin for you and keeps the price lower than your initial asking price.",1110000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I need to be closer to my target price.  Let's meet in the middle again and settle on $1,115,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",1115000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Considering our previous negotiations, I propose $1,105,000 for the product. This offers a good balance between our interests.",1105000.0,Bob,6,
