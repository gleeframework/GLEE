Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts the $150 offer, you make a $30 profit over selling to John.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than $120."
