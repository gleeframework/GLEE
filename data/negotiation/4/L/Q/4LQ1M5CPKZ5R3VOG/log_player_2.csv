"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you.**  You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and she's asking for $9,500.
* **You can potentially save money by negotiating.**  You can counteroffer a lower price, hoping to get a better deal than $9,500. 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John if the negotiation with Alice fails.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and proceeding to a counteroffer gives you the best chance of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $9,500, but it's still within my budget.
* **Negotiation Space:** This counteroffer creates space for negotiation. Alice can either accept my offer, or she can make a counteroffer closer to my price. 
* **Avoiding John:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially avoid paying the full $10,000 to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above my ideal price.**  I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, and she's offering $9,250.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  The price is getting closer to my target, and I can likely get a lower price with another counteroffer.
* **John is a good backup:**  While it's risky, I can still buy from John for $10,000 if this negotiation fails.

By rejecting Alice's offer and sending another counteroffer, I can potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My previous counteroffer was $9,000, and Alice countered with $9,250. This offer of $9,100 is a compromise, bridging the gap between our last offers.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  It shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a better price, but I'm also willing to be reasonable.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'm pushing for a lower price, I'm not going too low. I'm still within my budget and keeping John's offer as a safety net."
