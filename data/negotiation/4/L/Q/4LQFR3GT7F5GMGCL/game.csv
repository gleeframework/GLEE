"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10500. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're being firm on your price. While $9500 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not comfortable going that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to get a great value. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10000, which would be $9750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but $9750 is still too low for me. Let's meet at $9900. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll be getting. What do you say?",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $9900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9700, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9700.0,Bob,8,
