"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a great value for the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that reflects the product's value to me while leaving room for negotiation.  I've chosen a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but not so high that it immediately shuts Bob down.  I've also included a message that emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can push for a bit more, especially since I have multiple rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000.  This takes into account your interest and my need to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer, and it's met my minimum price.  I'm happy to close the deal with Bob and avoid the potential complications of dealing with John in the future."
