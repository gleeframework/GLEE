Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much as possible from Bob without him rejecting the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $120, so offering it below this is pointless.
* **Our Minimum:** We absolutely need at least $150 (our guaranteed sale to John).
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $135 gives Bob a perceived discount while giving us a profit margin above our minimum if he accepts. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed profit from John."
