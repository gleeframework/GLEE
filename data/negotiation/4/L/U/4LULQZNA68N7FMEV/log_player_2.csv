"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! Would you like to take it home for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product for $100 from John, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer of $95 and go with John."
