Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but lower than my minimum of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm trying to establish a friendly tone while also emphasizing the value of the product. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** While it's unlikely I'll get $15,000 from Bob, starting high gives me the best chance of getting close to that figure. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I have space to lower the price without feeling like I'm giving away too much.
* **Maintain a positive relationship with Bob:** Being open to negotiation helps avoid a breakdown in communication."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling to John would be a much better outcome. However, I'm not willing to give up on a potential deal with Bob just yet. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to bridge the gap and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would allow me to move forward with the sale while still giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.  
* **Message:** I'm trying to be reasonable and signal that I'm willing to compromise. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer.
* **Decision:**  This is a strategic counter-offer that aims to:
    * **Maintain Negotiation:** By not completely rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the door open to a deal.
    * **Bridge the Gap:**  $10,500 is a substantial increase from Bob's offer, but still a good deal for Bob, given his initial valuation of $8,000.
    * **Increase Potential Profit:**  This offer gets me closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's previous offers, it's still significantly lower than my goal.  I am committed to maximizing my profit, and selling to John for $15,000 is a more desirable outcome at this point.  However, I'm still open to negotiation, and I want to explore if we can reach a price closer to my goal. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. I'm open to discussing this further, but $10,000 is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and trying to signal that this is my final stance. This strategy aims to put pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Decision:**  By making a counteroffer, I am trying to:
    * **Keep Negotiating:**  I am committed to reaching a deal that is as profitable as possible for me.
    * **Push for a Higher Price:**  While $10,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it is closer to my goal than Bob's previous offers.
    * **Signal Commitment:**  Stating that this is my final offer could potentially encourage Bob to accept.

This is a calculated risk, as Bob could reject the offer and I might end up selling to John for $15,000. However, I believe that I have positioned myself well in the negotiation, and there is still a good chance that Bob will accept my offer."
