"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
