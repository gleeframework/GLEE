{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your budget and represents a good compromise. While you could potentially continue negotiating, it's unlikely you'll get it down to your desired $800,000. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation delays or a potential loss of the deal."
