Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000.
