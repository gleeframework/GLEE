Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** This leaves room for negotiation without you losing too much.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** Shows you're confident in the product's value.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are comfortable with. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially make counteroffers to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It indicates you're willing to negotiate.
* **Is still above Bob's offer:**  This keeps the pressure on him to raise his offer.
* **Is closer to your desired price:** It increases the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
