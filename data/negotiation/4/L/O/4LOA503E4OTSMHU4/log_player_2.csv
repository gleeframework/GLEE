"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's getting closer to your maximum budget. You can potentially continue negotiating, but at this point, the risk of a lengthy negotiation with Alice might result in you missing out on a better deal with John. Accepting Alice's offer allows you to acquire the product while staying within your budget."
