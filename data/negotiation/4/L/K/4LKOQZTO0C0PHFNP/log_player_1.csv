Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name] before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * You earn a significant profit, exceeding John's offer.
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its actual worth to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that might be attractive enough to accept."
