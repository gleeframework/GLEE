{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is closer to Bob's value, but still gives me a good profit. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and John is waiting in the wings with a higher offer. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $9,800, and that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident John will buy the product for $12,000, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob. It's time to move on to a sure thing."
