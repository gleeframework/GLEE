Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $9,000, which is higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and encouraging:** My message is friendly and highlights the value of the product for Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed. This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and adjust accordingly. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a strong fallback position. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can confidently turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $8,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to reach a price closer to my goal.
* **John's offer remains strong:** John's willingness to pay $10,000 is a strong backup plan, giving me the confidence to continue negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our conversation, I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also protects my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to see the value in closing the deal.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message emphasizes the fairness of the price, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintain leverage:**  This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and have a good fallback option with John."
