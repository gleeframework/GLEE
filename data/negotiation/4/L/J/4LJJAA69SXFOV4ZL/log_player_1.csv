Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you makes it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This represents a significant discount for you and a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price slightly below my minimum threshold, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not asking for my full minimum, anticipating a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding John:** By starting high, I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob without having to rely on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I can get out of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  There's still room for me to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Not Rushing to John:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I want to maximize my earnings.  I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's worth and the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  $900,000 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's, increasing the likelihood of a deal. 
* **Maintaining My Minimum:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, ensuring I get a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $875,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer isn't close enough.
* **No Significant Room for Compromise:**  Further negotiation with Bob likely won't lead to a significantly higher price. 
* **Guaranteed Income:**  Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirements and ensures a profitable outcome. It's the safest and most financially sound option at this point."
