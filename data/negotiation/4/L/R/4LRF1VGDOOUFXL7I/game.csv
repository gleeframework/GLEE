"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,000,000 reflects the true value of this product and its potential, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $1,425,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price.",1425000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,425,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you place on the product.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However,  $1,000,000 is too far below the product's value. I can go as low as $1,250,000. This offer takes into account your budget constraints while reflecting the product's worth. Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This represents a significant discount for you and is within my budget.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
