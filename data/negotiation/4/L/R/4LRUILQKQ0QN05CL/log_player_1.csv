Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leverage my knowledge of his potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A price of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still being profitable for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm keeping John in the back of my mind, knowing I can always walk away and sell to him for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll use this opportunity to counteroffer and try to find a middle ground. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for a higher price gives me leverage during the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob that $1,000,000 is still a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies flexibility, leaving the door open for further discussion. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'm confident that if Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for a higher price."
