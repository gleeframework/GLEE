"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose specifics at this stage, I can tell you that it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it for $1,250,000.  This represents a significant savings for you, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
