Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit above my minimum.  I'm confident John will be a reliable backup if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could accept it and make a small profit, it's not worth selling for that low of a price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm reducing my price from $175 to $125. This is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
