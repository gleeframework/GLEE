"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $9,000 is the absolute lowest I can go right now.  I believe this is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is still the best I can do at this point. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,750 or is that still too low for you?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $8,900. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement in this round.",8900.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. I'm willing to go up to $8,850, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price or is that still too low for you?",8850.0,Bob,8,
