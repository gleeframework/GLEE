Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $9,000 is the absolute lowest I can go right now.  I believe this is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I have a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $9,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is still the best I can do at this point. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,750 or is that still too low for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While he's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I have a few more rounds to try and get closer to $9,000. I'm hopeful that with a few more counteroffers, we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $8,900. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. I'm willing to go up to $8,850, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price or is that still too low for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unlikely to go higher than $8,850. This is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I only have two rounds left.  There's a chance I could get a higher offer in those rounds, but the risk of reaching the end without a deal and ending up with $8,850 is too high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John at this point."
