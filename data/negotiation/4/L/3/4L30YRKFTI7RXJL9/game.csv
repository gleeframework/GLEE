"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're considering.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1200000, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. Considering the value of the product and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1400000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline at $1400000. Given my budget, I am unable to meet that price. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1300000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1350000. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway in my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My final counteroffer is $1350000. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1350000. I am committed to staying within my budget. I would like to make one last counteroffer of $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1350000, and I've already offered that price. I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm going to make one final offer: $1325000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",1325000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm also committed to staying within my budget. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutual agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
