"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation. $1,100,000 is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This should incentivize Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with continued negotiation.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,050,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still being above Bob's current offer.  I believe this is a fair price point that could potentially lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm confident I can get a bit more if I continue negotiating.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000, getting closer to Bob's offer. It's a significant amount for me, but I still believe it's a fair price. This move should signal my willingness to negotiate further, and hopefully convince Bob to agree in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still determined to get closer to my desired price.  I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get Bob to budge further.  I have a few rounds left and still haven't reached the point where selling to John is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time, offering $975,000. It's a significant concession, but I think it's a strong position to close the deal.  The gap between us is narrowing, and there's still a chance we can agree in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $880,000 is tempting, I'm still hesitant to accept it. There's only a small difference between this offer and selling to John. Since I have two rounds left, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer one last time to try and close the deal with Bob at a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a final compromise, hoping to meet Bob's needs while still getting a fair price. It's a significant concession, but considering the time remaining and John's offer, I'm willing to take this risk to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only one round remaining and Bob's final offer being only $50,000 more than John's, I'm going to sell to John.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the best option at this point to avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower price or no deal at all."
