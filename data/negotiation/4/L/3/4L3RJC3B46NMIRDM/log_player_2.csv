""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is significantly below what I'm able to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  $1,250,000 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $950,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price considering the unique value this product offers.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While you could try to push Alice closer to $1,000,000, there's no guarantee she'll go that low. Accepting $1,100,000 secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of her backing out or the negotiations stalling."
