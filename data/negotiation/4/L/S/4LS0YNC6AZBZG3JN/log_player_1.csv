Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows for some flexibility in case Bob counters with a lower price.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in your product's value and you're serious about selling it to Bob. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it is significantly below your minimum and leaves a lot of money on the table.  There's still room to negotiate with Bob, and a counteroffer could potentially get a higher price.  Selling to John is always an option, but let's see if we can squeeze a bit more out of Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $8,500 to make this work.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** You're not completely rejecting Bob's offer, showing a desire to reach a deal.
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  $8,500 is still closer to your minimum and a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Use persuasive language:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" for Bob strengthens your position.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that be agreeable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still a bit low.  You've already compromised, and you're not far off from your goal. There's still room to negotiate with Bob, and another counteroffer could potentially get you closer to your desired price.  Selling to John is always an option, but let's see if we can get a slightly better offer from Bob before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm feeling flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show a continued willingness to compromise:** You're demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Offer a 'middle ground' price:** $8,000 splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's last offer, making it seem like a fair solution.
* **Highlight the benefits of agreement:** Emphasizing a ""fair price for both of us"" encourages Bob to see the value in accepting. 

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob to close the deal!"
