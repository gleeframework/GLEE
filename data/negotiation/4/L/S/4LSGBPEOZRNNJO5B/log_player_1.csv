"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. $7,500 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $8,000 to him.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $8,250? This is a great deal for both of us, as the product is worth more than that to you."", ""product_price"": 8250}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $7,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
