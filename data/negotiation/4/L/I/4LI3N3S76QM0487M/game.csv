"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will deliver a strong return. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $12000? I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident this price is fair, given the potential value of the product. I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. How about $10500?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $10500 is closer, it's still a bit over my limit. I'm prepared to offer $10000.  This is my final offer.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm eager to close the deal. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
