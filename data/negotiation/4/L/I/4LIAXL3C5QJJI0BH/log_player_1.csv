Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,450,000.  I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to your business."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, I have a strong fallback position. This allows me to start with a high offer close to my guaranteed value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,450,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter. 
* **Justification:**  While not revealing my bottom line, my message hints at the product's high value, potentially making Bob more receptive to the high price.

By setting a high but potentially acceptable price, I maximize my chances of either securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value or falling back on my guaranteed sale to John."
