Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,000,000 with John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you have leverage.  You should aim for a price higher than $1,000,000 but low enough that Bob might find it appealing compared to not getting the product at all.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere.  Given its unique value, I'm valuing it at $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer creates a sense of urgency.
* **Value-Based Pricing:**  The message focuses on the ""unique value"" and doesn't mention Bob's perceived value.
* **Negotiation Room:** The price of $1,200,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter, or he might be unwilling to go above $800,000. If that happens, you can decide whether to negotiate further or take John's guaranteed offer."
