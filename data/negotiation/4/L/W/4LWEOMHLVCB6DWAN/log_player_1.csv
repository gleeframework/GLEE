Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it would be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is a price that's attractive to Bob (better than his $10,000 value) but still allows me to make a profit.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value proposition for Bob. I also want to emphasize that this is a good deal for him. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** By offering a price lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000), I open the door to negotiation. If Bob doesn't accept, I still have John as a backup.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  $12,000 is a good middle ground, potentially maximizing my profit while still being appealing to Bob."
