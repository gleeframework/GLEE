"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal considering his perceived value.  This also allows me to gauge his interest and see how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer,  $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and is getting closer to my desired price. Accepting his offer will ensure I get a decent profit and avoid the risk of further negotiations or selling to John for a lower price."
