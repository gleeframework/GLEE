"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer,  $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
