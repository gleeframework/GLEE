"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $15,500 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still too low.  Let's try $14,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $14,500 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $14,000 just won't work for me. If you're serious about buying the product, let's meet at $14,250.  That's the best I can do, but it's a fair price for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,7,
