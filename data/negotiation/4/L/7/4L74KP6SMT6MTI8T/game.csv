"I can see you're really pushing me to get the price down, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1100000 is still too high, but $1075000 is a more reasonable compromise. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
