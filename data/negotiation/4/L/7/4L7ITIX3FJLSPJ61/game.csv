,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",115.0,Bob,4,
