"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I think this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, close to your maximum budget and far above her own valuation. There's significant room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still above her valuation of $1,200,000. It leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price well within your budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** This opening counteroffer helps gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  Her response will give you valuable information about her flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its value. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, $1,350,000 is still significantly higher than her $1,200,000 valuation. This suggests she's willing to negotiate further.
* **Early Stages:** It's only Round 3 out of 10.  There's no need to jump at this offer yet. Continuing to counteroffer strategically can lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be frank, I'm working with a tighter budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? That's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price while remaining firm on your budget constraints.
* **Targeting Above Valuation:** The offered price is slightly above Alice's $1,200,000 valuation, making it likely she'll seriously consider it.
* **Maintaining Negotiation Space:** We're still leaving some room for negotiation in case Alice pushes back."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me.  What do you say to $1,300,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end and would allow me to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, her concessions are getting smaller. We need to signal that we're serious about a price closer to our counteroffer.
* **Time Leverage:**  We're halfway through the rounds, but Alice is likely feeling pressure to close the deal. We can use this to our advantage. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Don't forget about John's offer. While not ideal, it serves as a fallback option if negotiations stall significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement, but I need to see a price that works for both of us. Let's make this happen - I can do $1,250,000, and no lower."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer is a small concession from our previous offer, signaling we're willing to negotiate but standing firm. 
* **Final Offer Tone:** The message implies this is our best and final offer, encouraging Alice to accept.
* **Above Valuation:** It remains above Alice's estimated valuation, making it a potentially attractive deal for her. 
* **Time Pressure:** By Round 6, the clock is ticking, and this tactic might push Alice to accept to avoid losing the sale."
