"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He's offering $11,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $13,000. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and it leaves room for potential compromise.  While $11,000 is still higher than Alice's value of $10,000, it's significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $15,000, creating a potential win-win scenario."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $12,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial counteroffer, but still within his budget and much lower than John's price of $15,000. It's likely Alice won't go lower, so accepting this offer saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John."
