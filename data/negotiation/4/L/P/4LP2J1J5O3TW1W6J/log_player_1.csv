Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's a potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the value of the product to Bob. By rejecting, I can attempt to get closer to the $13,000 I initially proposed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my price a bit, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a more profitable deal than Bob's initial counteroffer."
