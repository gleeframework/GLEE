Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize her profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she needs to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While Alice wants as much as possible, starting too high could scare Bob away. Offering it slightly below her minimum ($11,999) leaves a small window for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Urgency and Value:** The message emphasizes the ""fantastic deal"" to entice Bob while not revealing she has another buyer."
