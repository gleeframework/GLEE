"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $12000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9500 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to $12000. Would you be willing to consider $11000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, which would be $10250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $10250 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to offer a final compromise -  $10750. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and ensures you get a great deal while allowing me to meet my minimum target. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10750, which would be $10125. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10125.0,Bob,6,
