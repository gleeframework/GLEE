"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $12000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I believe I can get closer to that value by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, which would be $10250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to offer a final compromise -  $10,750. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and ensures you get a great deal while allowing me to meet my minimum target. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10750, which would be $10125. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,125 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. It's more advantageous for me to sell to John at this point and ensure I get my minimum desired price."
