"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and our potential partnership.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $1200000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get closer to the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This price reflects the value you'll gain and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
