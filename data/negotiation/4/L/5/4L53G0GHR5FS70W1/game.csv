"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however, $200 is my asking price and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you considering John is willing to sell it to me for $80.",100.0,Bob,4,
