Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
