Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's always best to aim higher to see if you can maximize your profit with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but it leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression of a potential deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, you (as Alice) can decide to negotiate further or accept John's offer if necessary."
