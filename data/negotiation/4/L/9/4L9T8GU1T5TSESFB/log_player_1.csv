Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's so far below my minimum. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value the product brings, and I hope you'll consider it. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
