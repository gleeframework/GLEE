"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. While $13,250 is better than before, it's still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
