Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:**  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it. Starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can always fall back on the guaranteed sale. 
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then adjust her price accordingly, aiming for the highest possible price above her minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If she wants to ensure a sale, a price closer to $8,000 would be a safer bet."
