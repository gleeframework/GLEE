"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is above my minimum value, but gives Bob some room to negotiate. I believe this is a good starting point to explore potential gains while still leaving space for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer of $75. While it's better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80.  I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $85. This is still above my minimum value, but shows I'm willing to compromise and potentially reach a deal. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob initially offered $75, and I want to avoid selling to John for $80 at this stage."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer of $78. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell below $80 at this point. I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering Bob at $82. This is still above my minimum value and shows I'm willing to compromise, but it's also getting closer to Bob's previous offer of $78. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
