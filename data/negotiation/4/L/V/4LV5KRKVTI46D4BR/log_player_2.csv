"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should try to get a better price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but  $9,500 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to appear interested but also firm about wanting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering our product's value and market position, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. How about offering the product at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which means there's likely still room for negotiation.  We're getting closer to a good price, but it's worth pushing a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $8,250?"",
""product_price"": 8250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Progress:** Acknowledging Alice's price reduction (""appreciate you coming down"") shows you're engaged and encourages further negotiation.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering the exact midpoint between her last offer and your last counter-offer positions you as fair and solution-oriented.
* **Budget Justification:** Reiterating the ""budget"" concern maintains your stance without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a price that benefits both of us. How about considering $8,400 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield small incremental savings.  The difference between $8,400 and a potential best-case scenario (e.g., $8,300) isn't substantial enough to risk losing the deal. 
* **Good Deal:** Alice has moved considerably from her initial price, and $8,400 is a solid discount off the $10,000 alternative. 
* **Time Value:** Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids potentially protracted back-and-forth."
