"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's initial offer. While it's better than buying from John, Bob can likely get a better price. He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Considering your value for the product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This seems like a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to go down to $1300000. This would allow us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting the offer at $1,300,000 saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John and is a good compromise.  While there might be potential for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John and the time constraint make accepting this offer the most reasonable choice."
