"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum price.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my asking price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $8,500. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Given my current financial situation, I am comfortable with an offer of $8,200 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is closer to my desired price and a good compromise. I'm getting closer to my desired profit and it's only round 4. Selling to John would give me $8,000, so this offer is better than that. It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
