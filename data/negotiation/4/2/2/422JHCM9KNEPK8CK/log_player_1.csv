Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **For you:**  It's significantly higher than what John is offering, meaning a better profit. 
* **For Bob:** It's still below his perceived value, giving him a potential gain.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still maintaining a high chance of Bob accepting the offer."
