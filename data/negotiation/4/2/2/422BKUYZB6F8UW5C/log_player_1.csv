"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further. "", 
""product_price"": 1150000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. You have plenty of room to negotiate upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for you. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,100,000. I believe this price is more reflective of its true worth and offers you a good deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** We're coming down slightly from the initial offer to show willingness to negotiate, but not by much.  This emphasizes the product's value.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the ""value"" angle, specifically mentioning ""capabilities and potential"" *for Bob*. This keeps the focus on what *he* gains.
* **Middle Ground Language:** Framing the counteroffer as finding a ""middle ground"" encourages a collaborative tone rather than a confrontational one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,025,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to compromise suggests he's serious about closing the deal.
* **Time Value:**  While we could potentially negotiate for more, accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
