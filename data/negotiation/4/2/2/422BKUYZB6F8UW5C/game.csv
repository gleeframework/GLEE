"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for you. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,100,000. I believe this price is more reflective of its true worth and offers you a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
