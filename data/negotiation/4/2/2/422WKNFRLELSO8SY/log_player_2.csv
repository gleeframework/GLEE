"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since your maximum budget is $10,000, accepting Alice's offer means you'll overspend.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within your budget. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being a considerable discount for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price but it is still above your budget.  You can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but still lower than Alice's offer, making it appealing to her.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price significantly, it's still over your ideal budget.  It's now a better option to buy the product from John, as it will save you $500 compared to Alice's offer.  Further negotiation with Alice might be possible, but the risk of her rejecting your next offer and potentially increasing the price again is too high."
