"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $110 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to start negotiating and potentially get the price down closer to his ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Offering $95 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and puts the pressure on her to negotiate.
* **Be polite:** Even though Bob is negotiating, he wants to keep the conversation friendly to avoid alienating Alice. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:** Bob isn't just saying ""no"" to Alice's offer. He's counteroffering with a price he's willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking for something closer to $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $105 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal range. There's still potential for further negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob keeps the pressure on her to come down further.  He can use the threat of going to John as a bargaining chip.
* **Test the waters:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can gauge how much Alice is willing to budge on her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $100?  That feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** Bob is showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway, suggesting a price that's right in the middle. This helps maintain a positive negotiation tone. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $100 is still within Bob's budget and allows him to save $20 from Alice's previous offer.  
* **Emphasis on a fair deal:**  Bob emphasizes that this price is fair for both parties, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason."
