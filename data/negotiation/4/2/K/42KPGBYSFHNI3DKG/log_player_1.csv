Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it a great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  You know you have a guaranteed sale at $150 (from John), so you don't want to go lower than that.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** Bob values the product at $100. To make it appealing, you need to offer a price lower than $150 but higher than $100. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering it at $125 splits the difference between Bob's valuation and your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob a good deal while still earning you a profit above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still maintaining a high chance of Bob accepting the offer."
