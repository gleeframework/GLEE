"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can likely still get a better deal by counteroffering.  You are willing to pay up to $120, and she is willing to sell for at least $80, so there is still room for negotiation."
