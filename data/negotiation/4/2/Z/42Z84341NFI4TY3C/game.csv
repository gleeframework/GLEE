"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget constraint.  While $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
