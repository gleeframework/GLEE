"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
