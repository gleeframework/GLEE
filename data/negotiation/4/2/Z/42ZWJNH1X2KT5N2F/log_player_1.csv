Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  I know you recognize its significant value, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Offering the product at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message is phrased to encourage Bob's engagement and gauge his interest level. His response will guide further negotiation tactics."
