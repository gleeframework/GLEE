"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me.  I want to see how Bob reacts and gauge his interest before lowering the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a substantial decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum value. It's a fair middle ground that hopefully encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I will counter again and try to push the price up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This shows that I'm flexible, but it's still a significant amount for Bob, and I'm hoping he'll come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to reach a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum value and hopefully will be a sweet spot for Bob. I'm running out of time, so I'm trying to close the deal before having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can't risk another rejection and potentially lose out on a deal with John. I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I meet my minimum value and close the deal."
