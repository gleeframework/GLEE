Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

$1,500,000 is still too high, but Alice is showing willingness to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,500,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. Let's try $1,250,000. This would represent a significant saving for you and would be a good starting point for us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
