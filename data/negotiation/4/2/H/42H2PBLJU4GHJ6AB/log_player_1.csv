Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair starting point given my budget and the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
