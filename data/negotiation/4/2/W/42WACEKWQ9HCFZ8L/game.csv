"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more. How about $13,000? It's a good chunk closer to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  How about we make this the final offer - $11,750.  Let me know if that works for you, otherwise, I think I'll have to explore other options.",11750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,750. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,7,
