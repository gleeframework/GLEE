"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  There's a lot of room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price.  He can either counter-offer or move on to John, who is already offering a much more attractive price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still outside of Bob's comfort zone.  He's already shown that he's willing to walk away at $8,000, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that's still too high.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $12,500 is still too high for Bob.  He has a guaranteed alternative at $8,000, so it's worth holding out for a better deal.  There are still 5 rounds left, so Bob has time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $12,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He has a guaranteed option of buying from John for $8,000, so he can afford to hold out for a better deal.  There are only 3 rounds left, and Bob should continue negotiating, hoping Alice will come down further or risk losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round and Bob is running out of time. While $11,750 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's desired target.  Given that Bob has a guaranteed alternative of buying the product from John for $8,000, it's the most logical choice to secure the product at a lower price. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counter-offer, and the risk of losing a better deal is too high."
