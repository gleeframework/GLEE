I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can then gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum valuation of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum valuation and Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum valuation. While I could continue negotiating, I don't see any indication that he'll come closer to my desired price.  It's best to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
