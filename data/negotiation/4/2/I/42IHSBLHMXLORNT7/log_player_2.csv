"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $140 is not ideal.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. I'd be happy to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's split the difference and make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While Bob would ideally pay $120,  Alice's offer of $135 is closer to his value than John's price of $120.  It's a good compromise, and it avoids the potential for further negotiation that might lead to a higher price."
