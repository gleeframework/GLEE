"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and above what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a little justification for the price (""I think you'd really appreciate it""), even if it's vague. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and try to get as close to my desired price as possible, while still leaving room for negotiation. I'll be watching closely for Bob's response and adjusting my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $100 from John, so I can afford to be a little more demanding with Bob.
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $100. I'll likely propose a price somewhere between Bob's offer ($90) and my initial offer ($110)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing my offer from $110 to $105.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get (""still a great deal"").
* **Finality:**  I'm implying this is my final offer (""lowest I can go""). This adds pressure for Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to slowly reduce my price, but still maintain a margin above John's offer. I'm hoping that by emphasizing the value and suggesting this is my final offer, Bob will be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to pay $95 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $100.
* **John's Offer:**  With John's offer of $100, I can afford to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between Bob's offer ($95) and my last offer ($105). I might propose a price of $100 or $102, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference? I'll go down to $100 for you. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm again showing willingness to compromise by coming down to Bob's last offer plus a bit more.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price for both of us. This can make it easier for Bob to accept. 
* **Finality:** I'm not stating this is my final offer, but the emphasis on fairness makes it sound like I'm not going lower.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to get as close to John's offer as possible. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept.  If not, I'll have to consider if I want to risk losing a guaranteed $100 from John by continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $92 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but we're still $8 away from my ideal price.
* **Guaranteed Income:** John's offer of $100 provides a guaranteed sale without further negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 6.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further delays and potentially a lower price. 

**Decision:**

It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get closer to my ideal price, it's important to make a practical decision and ensure a sale."
