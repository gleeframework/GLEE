"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $80 to me.  It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $95 is close to my ideal price and still a good profit. I'll accept his offer and move on."
