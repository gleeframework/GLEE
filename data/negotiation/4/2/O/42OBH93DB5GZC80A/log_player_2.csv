"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your target price of $150. There's room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price of $80. This creates room for a potential compromise while ensuring you're still within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a little wiggle room. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your target price, but it's still above your desired $100. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer gives you a chance to potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your desired $100 and Alice's last offer of $110. It shows a willingness to meet in the middle and potentially reach an agreement in the next round."
