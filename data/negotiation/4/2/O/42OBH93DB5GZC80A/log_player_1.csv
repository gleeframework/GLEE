"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good middle ground between my minimum and Bob's potential value. This should open the negotiation and leave room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a little wiggle room."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? That way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what John would pay, and it's within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's close the deal."
