"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute highest price, which gives Bob space to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **I have more negotiating rounds.** There's no need to rush into accepting a deal that is significantly unfavorable. 
* **Selling to John is a backup option.**  If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway by reducing my price by $35, which is half the difference between his offer and my previous one. This shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $150, so I'm still getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **More negotiating room.**  I have several more rounds to try and close a deal closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a safe option.** If negotiations with Bob break down completely, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, I think we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $135 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $150, but still a profitable sale.
* **Finality:** By stating it's my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a clear justification for the price and indicating a willingness to make the deal work."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 6, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  
* **No significant progress:**  There is no indication that Bob is willing to budge significantly closer to my price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a safe and profitable option at this point.  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of a lower price or a failed deal."
