"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers immense value, and I'm confident you'll see a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet halfway at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $11,800. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",11800.0,Alice,5,
