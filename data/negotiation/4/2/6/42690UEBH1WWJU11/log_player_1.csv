Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

``` 

At this point, Bob is very close to my final offer, and continuing to push might make him walk away. Accepting $1,125,000 is a significant profit, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk getting stuck at a lower price or losing the sale to John's standing offer."
