"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1100000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great way to close the deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1000000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm thinking of a price around $1080000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
