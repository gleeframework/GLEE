"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate and try to get a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's strategic to begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than my actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is unacceptable.
* **Aiming High:** While my budget is $80, aiming for $60 allows for potential compromise. Alice might counter with a price closer to $70, which would still be a great deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have the option to go with John for $80 if negotiations with Alice don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $60 is lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $120? It's a fair price for a great product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While $120 is closer to my budget, it's still significantly more than I'm willing to pay. John offers the same product for $80, making Alice's offer less appealing.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice seems willing to negotiate, indicating a possibility to lower the price further. I'll aim for a counteroffer around $70-$75.
* **Backup Plan:** The option to buy from John provides a safety net. If Alice won't budge on the price, I can always fall back on my guaranteed $80 deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about $70? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 70}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $70 aims to split the difference between her previous offer ($120) and my last offer ($60).
* **Approaching My Limit:** I'm getting closer to my maximum budget, but I believe $70 is still a good deal if Alice accepts. 
* **Pressure & Alternative:** This offer puts a bit of pressure on Alice, as she knows I have a backup plan with John. This might encourage her to accept or propose a counteroffer closer to my target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $70 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $100? It's a fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice seems stuck around the $100 mark, and while she might budge a little, it's unlikely to be a significant drop. 
* **John's Deal is Better:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $80.  Paying more than that, even if it's slightly above, isn't the most financially sensible choice.
* **Time Value:**  Further haggling with Alice might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
