"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $15,500?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to be flexible, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $15,500, which would be $14,750. Can you consider this offer?",14750.0,Bob,4,
