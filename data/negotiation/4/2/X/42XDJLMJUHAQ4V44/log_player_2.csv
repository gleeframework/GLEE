You can do better than $110. You should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $112.50?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

You're still closer to your goal of $100.  Alice is already coming down in price, so it's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can close the gap further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $112.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $107.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 107.5}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I can do $109, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and while it's not your ideal price, it's still a good deal considering your maximum budget of $120 and John's price. Accepting this offer saves you $11, which is a worthwhile gain."
