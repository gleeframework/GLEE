"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This is a common tactic in negotiation, but I'm also aware that I need to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and avoiding a stalemate.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to give Bob a chance to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to be more assertive in my counter-offer to ensure I get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but still remaining above Bob's valuation. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.  I believe this price is a good compromise that could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue with Bob for now. However, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to  lower my offer again, but this time just slightly. I'm  getting closer to Bob's valuation, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe this price is fair and could lead to a quick deal.  However, if he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like Bob is finally willing to meet it.  While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and me having to sell to John for the same amount is too high. I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
