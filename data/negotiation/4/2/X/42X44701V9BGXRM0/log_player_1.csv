Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality, and I know you'll be happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $120, starting with a higher price ($150) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $120. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping Bob's valuation in mind."
