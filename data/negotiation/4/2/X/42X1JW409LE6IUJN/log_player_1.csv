Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) but lower than what it's worth to Bob ($100). This is a good starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $130. This is still lower than what the product is worth to me, but it's a step closer to my desired price and hopefully shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate."
