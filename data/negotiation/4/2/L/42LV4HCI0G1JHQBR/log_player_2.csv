"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000, which is $400,000 more than its worth to me. I'll consider buying it from John instead.
