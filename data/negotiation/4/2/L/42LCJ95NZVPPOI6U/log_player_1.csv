"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me room to negotiate down if he counter-offers, but it also ensures I make a decent profit. I'm aiming for a quick deal, so I'm not starting too low, as that might lead to multiple rounds of counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This still allows me to make a decent profit, while offering you a great price on this amazing product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still keeping my profit margin in mind."
