Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could we perhaps agree on $18,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I am still working within my budget constraints. Would $16,000 be a fair compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Reasoning: While ideally, I'd want to get closer to $18,000, accepting at $16,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds. Holding out for a higher price from Bob risks getting stuck with a worse offer later, or even reaching an impasse and having to sell to John for $15,000."
