"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000, so accepting would be a bad deal.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is also worse than negotiating with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $775,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still above your desired budget.  There's still room to negotiate.  Buying from John is a worse option at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
