"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  The product is only worth $100 to Alice, so there's room for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 115? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make some concessions to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is closer to Bob's ideal price of $105. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not go lower or that the negotiation process would take too long. Buying from John for $120 is not a good option, as $115 is a better deal. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice."
