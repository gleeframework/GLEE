(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down significantly from the initial offer, and he's now only $65,000 over his target price.  It's unlikely he'll be able to get a lower price, and he risks losing the deal entirely if he continues to negotiate."
