"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm confident in the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but $750,000 is still too far below what I can accept.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $1,200,000. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I'd prefer to work something out with you. My final offer is $900,000. This is a firm price, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",900000.0,Alice,5,
