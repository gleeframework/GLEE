"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and features.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, the product's worth significantly more than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This price reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I still think $10,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, there's still a gap between your offer and the product's true value.  I'm willing to consider $15,500 as my final offer.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's more than fair.  Let me know your decision.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really hoping we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,6,
