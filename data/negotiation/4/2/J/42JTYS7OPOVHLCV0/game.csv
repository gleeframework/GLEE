,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $700000 at this time.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is unfortunately below the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, however. I'm happy to reduce the price to $850000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price and my final offer. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
