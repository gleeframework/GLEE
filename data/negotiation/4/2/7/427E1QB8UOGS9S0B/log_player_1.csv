Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $10,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,250?"", ""product_price"": 12250}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $12,250 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we do $11,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is too low for me. I could come down to $11,750, which is my final offer.  This product is worth the investment, and I wouldn't want you to miss out on it."", ""product_price"": 11750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate that this is your final offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I can do $11,250, but I can't go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer from $11,250. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John and not risk Bob walking away in the remaining rounds."
