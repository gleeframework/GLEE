Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Aiming for Surplus:** Since you know the product is worth $120 to Bob, aiming for a price like $115 allows both you and Bob to benefit from the transaction. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $115, you leave some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, making him feel more involved in the process. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your absolute minimum, there's still room for negotiation. He's clearly interested in the product and willing to pay a price that's beneficial for you. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a slightly better deal, while not completely shutting down the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still significantly above your absolute minimum ($100) and closer to Bob's perceived value ($120). 
* **Clear Justification:** By framing the price as a balance between value and affordability, you're providing Bob with a reason to accept your counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, would you be open to selling the product to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has incrementally increased his offer and is now at $105.  This is a reasonable profit margin for you ($5 above your minimum).  While you *might* be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, there's also the risk that Bob will walk away if you push too hard.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
