Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, channeling your inner Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you a chance to own this truly unique item.  Its value is significant, and I know you recognize its worth. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. It's a fair deal that allows us both to benefit. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum. Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and inherent value, appealing to Bob's understanding of its worth.
* **Win-Win Proposition:** Framing the offer as mutually beneficial encourages Bob to see it favorably. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John gives you leverage. You're not desperate, allowing you to negotiate from a position of strength."
