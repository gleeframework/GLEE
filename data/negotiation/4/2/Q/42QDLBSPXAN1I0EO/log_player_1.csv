"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product.  My asking price is $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its true value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Motivating offer:** The price is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth, making it a tempting offer for Bob.
* **Setting the stage:** A strong opening price sets the expectation for negotiation and makes it less likely that Bob will immediately lowball me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd like to get a better price,  it's not worth selling it for $600,000, which is less than half its worth to me. It's better to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I still have 9 rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum. Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but offering a counter-proposal to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:** I highlight the potential for a ""good deal"" for both of us, fostering a cooperative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart. I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a significant loss.  It's important to continue negotiating, as I still have 6 rounds remaining.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob to come closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my offer again, but I'm still well above my minimum.
* **Addressing budget concerns:** I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations, suggesting I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintaining value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify my counteroffer, reminding Bob of the potential benefit.
* **Urgency:** I mention ""reaching an agreement,"" subtly implying that time is running out, potentially encouraging Bob to consider my offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement towards a deal. To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. It's a fair offer considering my budget.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $800,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to take such a significant loss, especially since I have four more rounds to negotiate. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $800,000 is closer to where I need to be, but it's still below my minimum.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's our last chance to find common ground before I have to consider other options. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm showing a significant willingness to compromise by coming down to $1,200,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Urgency:** I subtly emphasize the importance of reaching a deal by mentioning ""other options,"" hinting at the possibility of selling to John. This adds pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I reiterate the value of the product and highlight the ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially making him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Closing Statement:** I use a strong closing statement (""Let's make this happen"") to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
