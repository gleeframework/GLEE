"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum. Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart. I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement towards a deal. To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. It's a fair offer considering my budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $800,000 is closer to where I need to be, but it's still below my minimum.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's our last chance to find common ground before I have to consider other options. Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
