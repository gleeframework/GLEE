Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while ensuring we don't leave money on the table.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals a willingness to negotiate, preventing an immediate rejection and keeping the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

**Worst Case Scenario:**  Bob rejects our offer, but we have our guaranteed sale to John at $800,000. 

**Best Case Scenario:** Bob accepts our initial offer, or we negotiate down to a price significantly higher than $800,000, maximizing our profit."
