"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $19000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move this deal forward.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $19000. How about we meet at $17500? I'm willing to make a serious decision if we can agree on a price",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $17500 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $18500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close this deal.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that this product might not be worth the investment for me at this price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to consider buying from someone else",15000.0,Bob,6,
