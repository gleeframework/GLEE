This initial offer sets a high starting point while still leaving room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is a better offer than John's $15,000, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $19,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move this deal forward."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $19000. How about we meet at $17500? I'm willing to make a serious decision if we can agree on a price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  While Bob seems serious about buying, $17,500 is too low. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $17,500 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $18,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 18500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that this product might not be worth the investment for me at this price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to consider buying from someone else 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to make a bit more,  Bob's final offer of $15,000 is my minimum price.  However, since he's threatening to walk away,  it's not worth risking losing this deal.  I'll sell to John for $15,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
