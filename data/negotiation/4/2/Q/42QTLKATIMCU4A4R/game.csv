,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $25000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Can you consider this price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $22000, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $19500. Can you consider this price?",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $19500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I can offer you a price of $21000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",21000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $19000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $19000. I can offer you a price of $20500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a significant concession, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",20500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer you a price of $19000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one last concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $18000. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $15000.",18000.0,Bob,10,
