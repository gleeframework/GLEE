"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This is a risky move, but it gives me the potential to maximize my profit. If Bob accepts, I've done very well. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down in the following rounds, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's my minimum acceptable value, and I'm aiming for higher.  Even if I can't get my initial asking price, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices.  This price is still above John's offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will find it appealing enough to accept and avoid further negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300.
