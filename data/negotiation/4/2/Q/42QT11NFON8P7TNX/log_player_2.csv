# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! After considering your interest, I'd like to make you an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice and $800,000 to you. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for you.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. You can try to negotiate further."

While Alice has come down in price, $1,025,000 is still above your budget. You can continue to negotiate or buy from John.  Given your budget constraints, it's worth exploring a counteroffer one more time."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'll make one more counteroffer at $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $1,015,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's highly likely that Alice will stick to her final offer.  Since you can buy the product from John for $800,000, it's the best decision to go with John and save yourself $215,000."
