"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can offer you a compromise at $102. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
