Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential,  $1000000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $750000. This would allow me to make the investment while still leaving room for potential negotiation on my end. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
