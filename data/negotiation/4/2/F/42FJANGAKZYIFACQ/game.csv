"Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $12000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, I think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
